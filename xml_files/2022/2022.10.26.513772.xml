Dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens and inducing functional differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into regulatory (pTreg) or pro-inflammatory (Th) subsets. However, the exact nature of the DCs inducing tolerance or inflammation to dietary antigens has been difficult to define. Using an intestine-adapted Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts (LIPSTIC) combined with single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized DCs presenting dietary antigens in the context of tolerance or infection. At steady-state, migratory cDC1 and cDC2 DCs, but not resident DCs, were found to present dietary antigen to cognate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Whereas cDC2s promoted T cell activation, only cDC1s induced their differentiation into pTregs. Infection with the helminth <italic>Strongyloides venezuelensis</italic> abrogated cDC1 presentation of dietary antigens, preventing pTreg and oral tolerance induction. In contrast, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> infection only partially affected cDC1s, allowing oral tolerance to be maintained. An expanded population of cDC2s that induced type-2 immunity during both helminth infections did not present dietary antigens, demonstrating that compartmentalized presentation of luminal antigens can prevent food-specific Th2 responses during inflammatory conditions. Our data uncover novel cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted during infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The balance between pro-inflammatory and tolerogenic immune responses depend on interactions between dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the intestine, DCs take up food and microbial antigens from the intestinal lumen and then migrate to the gut-draining lymph nodes (gLNs) where they present these antigens to naïve T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. By inducing differentiation of regulatory or pro-inflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell functional subsets during antigen presentation, DCs orchestrate finely-tuned immune responses to different intestinal antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Although intestinal DC subsets with different tolerogenic and immunogenic functions have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it remains unclear how DC-T cell interactions are organized to enable distinct immune responses given the density and diversity of luminal antigens constantly present in the gLNs. Furthermore, how diet or enteric infections regulate DC-T cell interactions to modulate immune outcomes is incompletely understood. Here we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying the decision between tolerance or immunity to dietary antigens.</p><p id="P3">Oral tolerance, a process dependent on peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs), is critical for preventing inflammatory responses to food antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Migratory classical DCs are subdivided into two subsets, cDC1 (CD103<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>−</sup>) and cDC2 (CD103<sup>+/−</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>), both of which have been implicated in the induction of tolerogenic pTregs. Early studies examining CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs documented their ability to induce pTregs in a manner dependent on TGF-β and the retinoic acid-producing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, oral tolerance is maintained upon genetic depletion of cDC1s, even though food antigen-specific pTreg induction is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Targeting cDC2 antigen presentation also reduces pTreg differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism among DC populations in promoting tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Full dissection of the role of DCs in oral tolerance has thus been limited by reliance on traditional knockout strategies, which have incomplete targeting efficiency and specificity and suffer from compensatory effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P4">Conclusive determination of which DCs dictate tolerance or inflammation in the gut requires the ability to precisely identify DCs presenting antigen in these contexts. To this end, we used an intestine-adapted version of LIPSTIC, which allows proximity-dependent labeling of intestinal cell-cell interactions <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. LIPSTIC tracks the exact DCs that interact with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an antigen-dependent manner, avoiding confounding factors due to parallel immune responses to other luminal stimuli. In the LIPSTIC system, CD40L (expressed by recently activated T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>) and CD40 (expressed by DCs) are functionalized by fusion to Sortase A (SrtA) and its receptor G5, respectively. Injection of labeled SrtA substrate (the peptide LPETG conjugated to biotin) leads to its capture by donor SrtA-expressing T cells. DC-T cell interaction results in covalent transfer of substrate from T cell to DC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Interacting DCs are thus detectable by flow cytometry with biotin-specific reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To identify the intestinal DCs that present dietary antigens and prime cognate naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we adoptively transferred 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> naïve ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD40L-SrtA OT-II (<italic>Cd40lg</italic><sup>SrtA/Y</sup> OT-II) T cells into G5-CD40-expressing (<italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup>) mice. To induce a pTreg-dependent tolerogenic response, recipient mice received a single intragastric (i.g.) dose of PBS (control) or OVA 18h after cell transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. LIPSTIC labeling of interacting DCs in the gLNs was carried out by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of biotinylated LPETG substrate 22-24 h after i.g. OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), a point at which CD40L is upregulated on the transferred OT-II cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1a, b</xref>). LIPSTIC labeling was observed in a small fraction (approximately 2 to 3%) of total DCs in the gLNs of mice that received OVA, but not in control mice that received i.g. PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Increasing the number of transferred OT-II T cells did not increase DC labeling frequency, indicating that most if not all DCs presenting to OT-II T cells are captured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, DC labeling was fully inhibited by injection of a CD40L-blocking antibody (clone MR1) 22 h hours prior to substrate injection, confirming that CD40-CD40L interaction is required for labeling to take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To evaluate whether DC-T cell interactions identified by LIPSTIC are cognate and dependent on MHC-II-antigen presentation by the DCs, we reconstituted lethally irradiated C57BL/6J mice with a mixture of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup> and <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup>,<italic>H2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (MHC-II-deficient) bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Labeling was only observed in DCs that expressed MHC-II, confirming that the interactions captured by LIPSTIC are dependent on cognate antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Functional <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation co-cultures where 150 <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup> gLN DCs are incubated with 750 naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II CFSE-labeled T cells, showed that biotin<sup>+</sup>, but not biotin<sup>−</sup>, DCs are able to induce T cell proliferation to a level above background as observed with gLN DCs from OVA-naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). When we added exogenous OT-II peptide to the cultures, both biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs induced T cell proliferation; however, only biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs were capable of inducing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These data show that biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs were loaded with OVA antigen <italic>in vivo</italic> and have an intrinsic ability to induce a regulatory T cell response. Corroborating previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, LIPSTIC labeling was detected only on migratory (MHC-II<sup>hi</sup>) but not resident (MHC-II<sup>int</sup>) DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Despite higher frequency of total cDC1s compared to cDC2s in the proximal duodenal gLNs (D1 and D2; the preferential sites for food-specific pTreg induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>), labeling of cDC1 and cDC2 by OT-II T cells occurred at a similar ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Therefore, both major migratory subsets of DCs were equally capable of presenting dietary antigens to specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We conclude that LIPSTIC is a sensitive and specific tool for monitoring intestinal cell-cell receptor-ligand interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> which accurately identifies the DCs that prime dietary antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the gLNs.</p><p id="P6">To gain further insight into the profile of food antigen-presenting DCs, we performed plate-based single-cell mRNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) of biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs from the duodenal gLNs (D-gLNs) 24 h after an i.g. administration of OVA. DCs fell into four transcriptional clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), two corresponding to migratory DCs (Clusters 0 and 1) and two that corresponded to resident DCs (Clusters 2 and 3) based on expression of <italic>Ccr7</italic> and MHC-II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Among migratory DCs, Cluster 0 expressed signatures associated with a cDC2 phenotype, while Cluster 1 DCs were associated with a cDC1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2c-e</xref>). In agreement with flow cytometry data, biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs comprised a mixture of migratory cDC1s and cDC2s at a roughly 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Differential gene expression comparing biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> cDC1s and cDC2s from the D-gLNs showed that both subsets of biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs upregulated genes encoding for markers of DC maturation (<italic>Cd80, Cd86, Cd40</italic>) and the cytokine <italic>Ebi3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed higher expression of surface CD40, CD80, and CD86 in biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2f-h</xref>). cDC1s showed increased expression of several genes associated with pTreg generation, such as <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> (RALDH2), <italic>Tgfb2</italic> (cytokine TGF-β2), <italic>Itgb8</italic> (integrin β8), <italic>Ncoa7</italic> and <italic>Sod1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2e</xref>). In contrast, cDC2s were characterized by high expression of genes associated with inflammatory responses (<italic>Cd44, Tyrobp, Bhlhe40, Fcer1g</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To evaluate the ability of each biotin<sup>+</sup> DC subset to induce pTregs, we co-cultured biotin<sup>+</sup> cDC1s or biotin<sup>+</sup> cDC2s with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells. This showed that only biotin<sup>+</sup> cDC1s were capable of inducing pTreg differentiation above background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Our data therefore suggest that DCs actively engaged in priming food-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display an activated profile and, even though cDC2 are able to present dietary antigens, pTreg differentiation is predominantly dependent on cDC1.</p><p id="P7">We previously showed that infection with <italic>Strongyloides venezuelensis (S.v.)</italic>, a helminth with duodenal tropism, prevents localized food-specific pTreg development and impairs induction of oral tolerance by generating an immunological conflict at the site of oral antigen presentation, the D-gLNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To determine whether any helminth infection can interfere with food-specific pTreg differentiation and oral tolerance, we infected C57BL/6 mice with <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H.p.)</italic>, which also displays duodenal tropism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Five days post-infection (d.p.i), we adoptively transferred naïve OT-II T cells into host mice, followed by two doses of i.g. OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). OT-II pTreg induction was only slightly impacted by <italic>H.p</italic>. infection compared to the drastic reduction in pTregs induced by <italic>S.v</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Accordingly, oral tolerance was intact following <italic>H.p</italic>.infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3a-d</xref>), suggesting that the pTregs generated by OVA feeding were sufficient to prevent overt inflammation upon OVA-adjuvant immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Both <italic>H.p</italic>. and <italic>S.v</italic>. infections led to decreased in total cDC1 and increased of total cDC2 frequencies in the D-gLNs, which was more extreme in <italic>S.v</italic>. infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To determine how these distinct helminth infections affected DC presentation of dietary antigen to food-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we infected <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup> mice with <italic>H.p</italic>. or <italic>S.v</italic>. and then adoptively transferred naïve <italic>Cd40lg</italic><sup>SrtA/Y</sup> OT-II T cells at 5 d.p.i, administered i.g. OVA, and performed LIPSTIC labeling as described above. Whereas approximately 15% of DCs presenting dietary antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>H.p</italic>. infection were of the cDC1 phenotype, this fraction fell to virtually zero in the D-gLNs of <italic>S.v</italic>. infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3f-h</xref>). To test the ability of OVA-presenting biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs to induce pTregs in the context of these helminth infections, we co-cultured biotin<sup>+</sup> or biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs from <italic>H.p</italic> or <italic>S.v</italic>. infected mice with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells in the presence of exogenous OT-II peptide. As observed previously (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), whereas biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs from uninfected mice were capable of inducing pTreg differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs from infected mice failed to induce pTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). To assess the intrinsic ability of OVA-presenting biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs to induce pTregs in a non-OT-II system, independently of the presence of antigen acquired <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed co-culture experiments using monoclonal transnuclear (TN) T cells bearing an unrelated T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a peptide of the β-hexosaminidase enzyme of commensals of the Bacteroidetes phylum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We co-cultured biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs, labeled by the OT-II T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> TN T cells in the presence of the TN cognate peptide. TN cells differentiated into pTregs when cultured with biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs from uninfected or <italic>H.p</italic>.-infected mice, but not from <italic>S.v</italic>.-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>). Thus, biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs (labeled due to their ability to present OVA <italic>in vivo</italic>) were able to induce pTreg differentiation when presenting an unrelated antigen, confirming that this is an intrinsic trait of the biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs rather than a property of the antigen they acquired <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs from both helminth infections induced TN cells to differentiate towards a GATA3<sup>+</sup> Th2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>), in accordance with the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings of endogenous Th2 response to helminth infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Of note, <italic>in vitro</italic> pTreg induction of TN cells by biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs derived from <italic>H.p</italic>.-infected mice and Th2 induction by biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs under both helminth infections were not observed in OT-II cells, which may reflect different properties and activation thresholds of monoclonal T cells bearing different TCRs. We conclude that different helminth infections have distinct impacts on DCs presenting dietary antigen and inducing pTreg differentiation; even during these extreme type-2 immune contexts, DCs presenting dietary antigens did not promote overt diet-specific Th2 differentiation.</p><p id="P9">To better understand the influence of helminth infections on the phenotype of dietary antigen-presenting DCs, we next performed sc-RNA-seq profiling of D-gLNs biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs in the context of <italic>H.p</italic> and <italic>S.v</italic>. infection and compared them to our dataset of OVA-presenting DCs in steady state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Transcriptional UMAP profiling assigned DCs to 6 major unbiased clusters, which we defined based on their top differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Clusters 0, 1, 2 and 3 corresponded to migratory DCs, whereas Clusters 4 and 5 corresponded to resident DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Among migratory DCs, Cluster 0 cells expressed genes associated with a cDC1 signature whereas Clusters 1, 2 and 3 were associated with a cDC2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4a, b</xref>), in accordance with previous reports showing that cDC2s display a more heterogeneous transcriptional program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Among biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs, we observed an expansion of Cluster 3 cDC2s during <italic>H.p</italic>. infection, which was even more pronounced in <italic>S.v</italic>.-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). DCs from this cluster were characterized by high expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory Th2 response to worm infections, such as <italic>Pdcd1lg2</italic> (which encodes PD-L2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, <italic>Stat5a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, <italic>Ccl24</italic> (a chemotactic factor for eosinophils and lymphocytes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and <italic>Cd1d1</italic> (involved in lipid-based antigen presentation to iNKT cells, which play a role in the response to worm infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P10">Together with the induction of Th2 by biotin<sup>−</sup> DCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>), these data suggest that Cluster 3 cDC2s were responsible for inducing a Th2 response against helminth infections, in agreement with previous studies showing that cDC2s are required for type-2 immunity to <italic>H.p</italic>. infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any differences in the frequency of Cluster 3 cells among biotin<sup>+</sup>DCs in the three experimental groups, suggesting an absence of food-specific Th2 responses during helminth-induced type 2 immunity. Instead, there was a gradual increase in Cluster 1 cDC2s among DCs presenting dietary antigens in the context of <italic>H.p</italic> and especially <italic>S.v</italic>. infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These DCs showed a less mature phenotype when compared to DCs from Cluster 0 or 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4c, d</xref>). Cluster 1 DCs also lacked the tolerogenic potential of cDC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4c</xref>) but did not express the full pro-inflammatory signature of Cluster 3 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4d</xref>). This suggests that, during tolerance-disrupting infections, dietary antigen-presenting DCs fail to acquire Treg inducing capacity; yet, they do not promote overt Th2 differentiation towards the diet. This conclusion is supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, where no Th2 induction was observed by DCs presenting dietary antigen (biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs), even in the context of helminth infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-h</xref>).</p><p id="P11">DCs from Cluster 0 displayed a tolerogenic transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) corresponding to that of the pTreg-inducing cDC1 population identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, above. Importantly, the ratio of biotin<sup>+</sup>cDC1 to cDC2, approximately 1 at steady state (OVA), fell to 0.5 upon <italic>H.p</italic>. infection and to close to 0 in the presence of <italic>S.v</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3g, h</xref>). In agreement, principal component analysis (PCA) of total biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs under these three different conditions showed that <italic>S.v</italic>. infection markedly shifted the profile of DCs presenting dietary antigens away from the tolerogenic transcriptional program of cDC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), with <italic>H.p</italic>. biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs displaying an intermediate profile between OVA and <italic>S.v</italic>. biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, e</xref>). We therefore sought to understand whether the absence of dietary antigen presentation by biotin<sup>+</sup> cDC1 (Cluster 0) or the expansion of biotin<sup>+</sup> cDC2 (Cluster 1) presentation would be responsible for preventing the generation of pTreg in the context of <italic>S.v</italic>. infection. We co-cultured naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells with <italic>S.v</italic>. biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs and OVA biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs, either alone or in combination. Whereas <italic>S.v</italic>. biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs failed to induce differentiation of pTregs, both OVA biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs and a combination of <italic>S.v</italic>. and OVA DCs were able to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, OVA biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs are dominant in their ability to induce pTreg differentiation, indicating that the presence of a small fraction of cDC1s is both necessary and sufficient to induce a tolerogenic response even in the presence of a large pro-inflammatory DC population. This conclusion is supported by the finding that a reduced, but still detectable, dietary antigen presentation by cDC1 in the context of <italic>H.p</italic>. infection is sufficient to induce oral tolerance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Lastly, we sought to determine whether the changes in DC populations and profiles observed in the D-gLNs of mice during helminth infections were imprinted already in the gut tissue, prior to DC migration to the gLNs. DCs from the duodenum lamina propria of uninfected, <italic>H.p</italic>.- or <italic>S.v</italic>.-infected mice were sorted at 7 d.p.i., 1 day after i.g. OVA administration. Transcriptional profiling of lamina propria DCs revealed that DCs from <italic>S.v</italic>.-infected mice clustered separately from those of steady-state (OVA) or <italic>H.p</italic>.-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). We then selected significantly expressed genes exclusively detected in DCs from the duodenum lamina propria of <italic>S.v</italic>. infected mice to generate a <italic>“S.v</italic>. duodenum DC” signature, which we applied to our single-cell D-gLNs DC LIPSTIC transcriptomic dataset. D-gLNs DCs from <italic>S.v</italic>.-infected mice were enriched for the <italic>S.v</italic>. duodenum DC signature, suggesting that changes in DCs program were imprinted in the intestine, prior to their arrival at the gLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h, i</xref>). Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory Th2 inducing cDC2 signature observed in Cluster 3 of D-gLNs was enriched in the duodenum DCs of <italic>S.v</italic>. compared to OVA mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4e, f</xref>). Together, these data suggest that <italic>S.v</italic>. infection affects cDC differentiation, favoring a cDC2 in detriment of a cDC1 program in the lamina propria. This shift results in increased cDC2 migration and impaired pTreg generation in the D-gLNs and ultimately in failure to induce oral tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">The ability to isolate the exact DCs within a population that present antigens to the T cells of interest <italic>in vivo</italic> has been a longstanding challenge to the field. Intestine-adapted LIPSTIC allowed us to identify individual DCs actively engaged in presenting dietary antigen and priming of food-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the gLNs. Hence, we were able to define the transcriptional program and function of these DCs at steady state and in the context of infection-mediated disruption of pTreg and oral tolerance induction.</p><p id="P14">Our study revealed that, although both cDC1s and cDC2s present dietary antigens, pTreg differentiation is predominantly dependent on cDC1s. These findings add to the concept of hierarchical roles for cDC subsets in pTreg induction, shown previously using mouse models of lineage ablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Whereas genetic models are limited by incomplete depletion of cDC1s as well as off-target effects, the maintenance of tolerance upon ablation of cDC1s by excising IRF8 in cDC precursors observed in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> resembles the effects of <italic>H.p</italic>. infection observed here: decreased, but not absent, cDC1s and dietary antigen-specific pTreg induction, but sustained oral tolerance. In contrast, <italic>S.v</italic>. infection prevents oral tolerance induction by completely abrogating cDC1 presentation of dietary antigens and pTreg generation. It remains to be determined whether additional “immunological conflicts” such as reovirus infection, shown to induce food-specific Th1 responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, or scarring post bacterial infection, shown to prevent Treg and oral tolerance induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, specifically interfere with dietary antigen presentation by cDC subsets. LIPSTIC allowed us to uncover a compartmentalized antigen presentation dynamics that prevents the induction of food-specific Th2 cells during robust type-2 immunity induced by helminth infections. Furthermore, the intestine-adapted LIPSTIC technology presented here might be useful for future investigations of <italic>in vivo</italic> DCs inducing regulatory and inflammatory T cell responses to commensals or enteric pathogen-derived antigens. In conclusion, this work provides insight into the role of cDC1s as the primary population responsible for inducing food-specific pTregs and oral tolerance, and uncovers a novel mechanism by which infection can disrupt this pathway to impair oral tolerance by exclusion of migratory cDC1s from the draining LNs, rather than by their reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.
