'Terminal selector' transcription factors coordinate the expression of terminal gene batteries that specify cell type-specific properties. Moreover, pan-neuronal alternative splicing regulators have been implicated in directing neuronal differentiation. However, the cellular logic of how splicing regulators instruct specific synaptic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide mapping of mRNA targets and cell type-specific loss-of-function studies to uncover the contribution of the nuclear RNA binding protein SLM2 to hippocampal synapse specification. Focusing on hippocampal pyramidal cells and SST-positive GABAergic interneurons, we find that SLM2 preferentially binds and regulates alternative splicing of transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, thereby generating cell type-specific isoforms. In the absence of SLM2, cell type-specification, differentiation, and viability are unaltered and neuronal populations exhibit normal intrinsic properties. By contrast, cell type-specific loss of SLM2 results in highly selective, non-cell autonomous synaptic phenotypes, altered synaptic transmission, and associated defects in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Thus, alternative splicing provides a critical layer of gene regulation that instructs specification of neuronal connectivity in a trans-synaptic manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Neuronal synapses are small but remarkably specialized cell-cell contacts. Across synapses, their strength, the probability of neurotransmitter release, and plasticity properties are tightly controlled and represent the basis for neuronal computations. While individual neuronal cells exhibit reproducible intrinsic properties that are linked to the genetic cell identity, the synaptic properties are a function of both, the pre- and postsynaptic partner cell. Thus, a single neuron can form synapses with dramatically different functional properties on two different target cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The genetic mechanisms underlying the specification of these properties are incompletely understood.</p><p id="P6">Pre- and postsynaptic compartments encompass high concentration of specific protein complexes which coalesce around nascent cell contacts. One candidate mechanism for generating target-specific synapse properties are trans-synaptic recognition codes that recruit select ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in the opposing synaptic membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Post-transcriptional mechanisms such as regulated alternative splicing are hypothesized to play a critical role in this process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated a significant expansion of alternative exon usage in organisms and tissues with high phenotypic complexity. Thus, alternative splicing programs are particularly complex in the nervous system and have vastly expanded in mammals and primates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, the high degree of splicing regulation in the brain is accompanied by the expression of a large number of neuronal splicing regulators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Recent rodent studies mapped developmental and cell type-specific alternative splicing programs in neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The targets of such regulation are enriched for risk genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and alterations in splicing events are associated with autism spectrum disorders in the human population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Genetic deletion of pan-neuronal RNA binding proteins results in severe alterations in vast programs of alternative splicing and simultaneous deletion of multiple RBP paralogues often results in embryonic or perinatal lethality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These studies firmly established a critical role for alternative splicing regulators in neural development. Loss of such regulators modifies alternative splicing of hundreds of target mRNAs and – in some cases - disrupts cell morphology and viability, accompanied by severe impairments of neuronal function. Thus, it has been difficult to dissociate specific functions of RBPs in controlling synaptic connectivity and function from a more general requirement for cell specification and viability. Other RBPs, such as the KH-domain containing paralogues SLM1 and SLM2 exhibit highly selective expression in neuronal cell types, raising the possibility that they may contribute to the terminal differentiation of these cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Global genetic ablation of SLM2 results in increased synaptic transmission, loss of long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus, and altered animal behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, given the lack of cell type-specific genetic studies the molecular logic of how these neuronal cell type-specific splicing regulators contribute to the acquisition of synaptic properties remains largely unclear. This is further complicated by the fact that a single RBP can control different target exons in different cell populations depending on the cellular context <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, we systematically probed the function of SLM2 which is highly expressed in glutamatergic CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and a sub-set of somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons in the mouse hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We tested the hypothesis that SLM2 directly regulates and selectively recruits mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins and, thereby, controls the terminal specification of synaptic properties. We combined genome-wide mapping of SLM2-bound mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> with conditional loss-of-function analyses in hippocampal pyramidal cells and SST interneurons in <italic>stratum oriens</italic> of hippocampus area CA1. We find that SLM2 is dispensable for the specification of cell types and their intrinsic properties but selectively controls alternative splicing of synaptic proteins, as well as synaptic function and plasticity in a trans-synaptic manner.

These include <italic>oriens-alveus lacunosum-moleculare</italic> (OLM) cells of CA1, a class of somatostatin-positive interneurons. It is unknown whether SLM2 functions are shared between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Within neuronal nuclei SLM2 is concentrated in nuclear sub-structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). These structures are reminiscent of SAM68 nuclear bodies, membrane-less organelles in non-neuronal cells that require RNAs for their assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, only a fraction of sub-nuclear structures in hippocampal neurons showed SLM2 – SAM68 co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). To identify SLM2-associated RNAs we used eCLIP on mouse whole brain and mouse hippocampal samples. Tag counts obtained with the CTK eCLIP analysis pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> from independent replicates were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1a</xref>). Consistent with the nuclear localization of SLM2, 77% of the binding events occurred in introns whereas only 2% mapped to exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>). Cross-link induced truncation site (CITS) analysis identified the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites, which are enriched in the UWAA tetramer element (W=U/A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig,S1b</xref>), a motif recognized by SLM2 <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. De novo motif discovery using mCross, a computational method to model RBP binding sequence specificity and crosslink sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, revealed a UUWAAAA 7-mer, with the cross-link occurring at U residues, as the dominant RNA motif bound by endogenous SLM2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>). Furthermore, the UWAA motif is similarly enriched in the whole brain and hippocampal eCLIP data and lacks comparable enrichment when analyzing eCLIP signals from <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1b-d</xref>). High confidence SLM2 binding events in the replicates were identified using CLIPper followed by IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≥2 and FDR? -log<sub>10</sub>≥2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of SLM2-bound mRNAs revealed a high enrichment of mRNAs encoding glutamatergic synapse components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1e</xref>). Amongst the 424 high confidence SLM2 target mRNAs in whole brain samples, 110 were annotated in SynGO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> to encode synaptic proteins, with 59 presynaptic and 49 post-synaptic density components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1h</xref>). These include pan-neuronally expressed mRNAs such as <italic>Nrxn1,2,3, Nlgn1, Lrrtm4, Dlgap1,2, Tenm2</italic> and <italic>Cadm1</italic>, as well as postsynaptic proteins preferentially expressed in GABAergic interneurons such as <italic>Erbb4</italic> and <italic>Gria4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. No significant peaks were observed in size-matched input samples and dense clusters of the UWAA motif in target mRNAs often closely aligned with SLM2 binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). These experiments uncover an array of mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins which are bound by endogenous SLM2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of cell type-specific SLM2-dependent exons</title><p id="P10">Considering that action of RBPs is frequently graded, i.e. dependent on expression level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we quantified SLM2 immune-reactivity across genetically marked hippocampal neuron subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a,b</xref>). We found that SLM2 expression was highest in CA3 pyramidal cells (marked by Grik4-cre, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2a</xref>) and significantly expressed in CA1 pyramidal cells (CamK2-cre) and SST interneurons (SST-cre) of area CA1 and CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2b</xref>). More than 90% of genetically marked CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells expressed SLM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2c,d</xref>). By contrast, SLM2 is not detectable in dentate granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To define SLM2-dependent mRNA splicing events in GABAergic versus glutamatergic populations, we performed conditional ablation and mapped ribosome-associated transcripts in the respective cell types by RiboTrap <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Using CamK2-cre, Grik4-cre, and SST-cre lines we selectively ablated SLM2 in hippocampal CA1 (<italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔCamK2</italic></sup>) and CA3 (<italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔGrik4</italic></sup>) pyramidal cells, and somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons (<italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c,d</xref>). All resulting conditional knock-out mice were viable and fertile and did not show overt physical alterations. Immunostaining for SLM2 confirmed complete loss of the protein at postnatal day 16-18 (p16-18) for <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup> and p42-45 for <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔCamK2</italic></sup> and <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔGrik4</italic></sup> in 75-90% of the cre-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). Using cell type-specific RiboTrap affinity isolation of actively translated mRNAs we deeply mapped the transcriptomes in wild-type and conditional knock-out cells (&gt;90 Mio uniquely mapping reads/sample, &gt;84% of reads mapping to mRNA, 4 replicates per genotype and cell population, one replicate for <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔCamK2</italic></sup> excluded due to 3’ bias, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref> for details). Principal component analysis of the resulting datasets uncovered highly similar transcriptomes within the respective cell type-preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>). There was very little variance between replicates or the RiboTrap samples from knock-out versus wild-type mice, suggesting that loss of SLM2 does not impact the terminal gene batteries of these cell types. Loss of RNA-binding proteins can exhibit broad effects on transcript abundance and stability. However, scatterplots further confirmed only minimal alterations at the level of overall gene expression between <italic>Slm2</italic> conditional knock-out and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2f</xref>) with only 1-5 genes exhibiting statistically significant differences in expression (adj. p-value ≤0.05 and fold change ≥ 1.5). The most strongly altered transcript (1.5-4.7fold up-regulated, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref> for details) was the SLM2 paralogue SLM1/<italic>Khdrbs2</italic>, consistent with the functional cross-repression between SLM1/2 paralogues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">We then performed genome-wide mapping of alternative splicing changes elicited by the conditional loss of SLM2. When comparing differential alternative exon usage across wild-type CamK2, Grik4, and SST cells, we identified 2860 differentially regulated exons between these populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>). Loss of SLM2 did not broadly modify these cell type-specific splicing signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>). Instead, conditional SLM2 knock-out resulted in significant de-regulation of only a handful of alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>, p-value ≤0.01, fold change ≥ 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5</xref>). Notably, loss of SLM2 resulted in increased exon incorporation at <italic>Nrxn2</italic> alternatively spliced segment 4 in all three cell populations (AS4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S3e</xref> for validation of splicing changes by qPCR, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S4a</xref> for a sashimi plot). Thus, all cell populations exhibited a high degree of exon skipping at <italic>Nrxn2</italic> AS4 in wild-type mice but exon mis-incorporation in the conditional knock-outs. By contrast, the corresponding alternative exon in <italic>Nrxn3</italic> was de-regulated only in CA3 (Grik4) and CA1 (CamK2) cells but was not SLM2-dependent in SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S3e</xref>). This reveals significant cell type-specific differences in SLM2-dependent alternative splicing regulation. De-regulation of the mutually exclusive alternative exons e23/e24 in Syntaxin binding protein 5-like (<italic>Stxbp5l</italic>, also called Tomosyn-2) was another splicing event commonly altered in CA1 and CA3 but not SST <italic>Slm2</italic> conditional knock-out neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S3c</xref>). In addition, our computational pipeline identified de-regulation of alternative exons in the unconventional myosin 1b (<italic>Myo1b</italic>) (in <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔCamk2</italic></sup> cells) and the ubiquitin ligase <italic>Ube2d</italic> and the GTPase-activating enzyme <italic>Arhgap42</italic> in <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup> cells.</p><p id="P12">Integration of the eCLIP and RiboTrap splicing analysis uncovered densely clustered intronic SLM2 binding events and repeats of the UWAA motif within 500 bases downstream of the de-regulated alternative exons of <italic>Nrxn1,2,3</italic> and <italic>Stxbp5l</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>). This demonstrates that SLM2 binding directs skipping of upstream alternative exons in the endogenous mRNA. Importantly, no significant eCLIP tags were recovered in <italic>Myo1b, Nkd2, Ube2d</italic>, and <italic>Arhgap42</italic> indicating that alternative splicing of these mRNAs is not directly regulated by SLM2. Besides these major alterations in a handful of genes, we observed further alterations in alternative exon incorporation in 61 additional mRNAs. Notably, the vast majority of these mRNAs are only very lowly expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S3b</xref>), indicating that the mRNAs are unlikely to have significant contribution to the cellular proteomes. Moreover, no eCLIP binding events were mapped to these mRNAs demonstrating that they are not directly bound by endogenous SLM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S4b</xref> for a Venn diagram summarizing this data). Notably, all directly bound mRNAs with significantly altered alternative splicing in the conditional knock-out cells, encode synaptic proteins. This strongly supports the hypothesis that SLM2 specifically controls synaptic properties in the mouse hippocampus in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Loss of SLM2 results in cell type-specific synaptic phenotypes</title><p id="P13">Considering the remarkable selectivity of SLM2 for binding and regulating mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins we probed the functional consequences of conditional SLM2 ablation in the hippocampal circuit. Global ablation of SLM2 is accompanied by increased evoked glutamatergic transmission at CA3-CA1 pyramidal cell Schaffer collateral synapses and increased postsynaptic AMPA-receptor accumulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown whether this phenotype arises from loss of SLM2 in the presynaptic CA3 cells and disruption of trans-synaptic interactions or whether it involves other cell types. Notably, conditional ablation of SLM2 in the presynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells resulted in a significant increase in postsynaptic currents evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S5a-c</xref>). Thus, deletion of SLM2 from CA3 neurons is sufficient to modify synaptic transmission onto postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells.</p><p id="P14">We next examined phenotypes resulting from conditional loss of SLM2 in GABAergic interneurons. We focused on horizontally oriented somatostatin interneurons located in the <italic>stratum oriens alveus</italic> of the hippocampus representing putative OLM interneurons which significantly express SLM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2b</xref>).

Conditional knock-out of SLM2 from SST interneurons (<italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup>) did not modify resting membrane potential, excitability or other intrinsic properties of SST+ interneurons, indicating that SLM2 is not required for the specification of these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S5c-f</xref>). Our eCLIP analysis uncovered abundant SLM2 binding to mRNAs that encode proteins of glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g,h</xref>). Thus, we examined glutamatergic inputs to <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup> cells. mEPSC amplitudes in SST interneurons were unchanged but we observed a significant shift towards a higher mEPSC frequency, suggesting an increased glutamatergic synapse density onto <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>ΔSST</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a-e</xref>).

We investigated AMPAR-mediated post-synaptic responses with increasing electrical stimulation of putative CA1 axons in the <italic>alveus</italic> and found a significant increase in excitation consistent with a larger synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Moreover, 40 Hz stimulation of the same axons led to a significantly elevated short-term facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>). Because short-term facilitation at this synapse is mediated via increased transmitter release, these results show that SLM2 in postsynaptic SST interneurons controls glutamatergic transmission and synaptic recruitment of these cells via a trans-synaptic mechanism.</p><p id="P15">We further analyzed GABAergic SST interneuron output synapses onto CA1.

Moreover, the kinetics of optogenetically evoked currents were unchanged, indicating normal assembly of postsynaptic GABA A receptors in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S5g</xref>). To assess short-term plasticity of evoked transmission, we applied 10 Hz optogenetic stimulation which induces a depression at OLM-CA1 synapses in wild-type cells.

Using eCLIP, we now demonstrate that endogenous SLM2 binds to a UUWAAAA 7-mer motif in vivo. The SLM2 paralogue SAM68 recognizes a similar motif in vitro. However, a direct comparison of alternative splicing profiles in <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> and <italic>Sam68</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> hippocampi suggests that de-regulated exons are largely paralogue-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4c</xref>). The endogenous SLM2 eCLIP targets are strongly enriched for mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins, including adhesion molecules, pre- and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules, and neurotransmitter receptors. Interestingly, only a small fraction of these SLM2-bound mRNAs exhibits alterations in alternative exon incorporation in conditional knockout mice. This might be a consequence of functional redundancy with other RBPs. Alternatively, SLM2-binding to target mRNAs in the nucleus may contribute to coordinated spatio-temporal control of an array of functionally related mRNAs which modifies their trafficking and/or translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Notably, for all regulated alternative exons, SLM2 binding sites consist of extended RNA motif clusters positioned in the downstream intron. Thus, clustered motifs are a pre-requisite for splicing regulation by SLM2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In all cases, loss of SLM2 results in aberrant exon incorporation, indicating a major role for SLM2 in driving exon skipping in wild-type cells.</p><p id="P19">Interestingly, loss of SLM2 did not result in significant alterations in the overall neuronal transcriptomes or functional intrinsic properties of SST-interneurons. Similarly, overall mRNA expression was unaltered in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells. This strongly suggests that SLM2 is dispensable for cell fate specification and the acquisition of functional properties of these cells. By contrast, SLM2 loss-of-function was associated with selective trans-synaptic phenotypes: Conditional ablation of SLM2 from CA3 pyramidal neurons led to an increase in postsynaptic currents at Schaffer collateral synapses onto CA1. This phenotype recapitulates the increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors and increased synaptic transmission observed in global <italic>Slm2</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In SST-interneurons, conditional <italic>Slm2</italic> deletion was associated with increased glutamatergic transmission likely resulting from an increased glutamatergic synapse density onto the mutant cells and increased presynaptic facilitation of synapses formed onto the knock-out cells. SLM2-dependent alterations in synaptic adhesion molecules in SST interneurons, such as TENM2, ERBB4, CADM1, ADGRL3, and postsynaptic NRXNs are well-positioned to direct such trans-synaptic regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.

This suggests that SLM2 regulates the level of functional recruitment of SST interneurons via altered splicing of a small set of mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins. Thereby, the RNA binding protein SLM2 shapes activation of CA1 cell assemblies and hippocampal information processing. SST interneurons provide branch-specific inhibition onto distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, powerfully controlling dendritic integration of synaptic information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.

Consistent with an aberrant activation of OLM-interneurons, SLM2 knockout mice exhibit an impairment in short-term memory in the hippocampus-dependent novel object recognition task. At the same time, other behaviors were indistinguishable from wildtype mice. While we cannot exclude a contribution of SST-interneuron populations besides OLM cells to the behavioral phenotype, our results support a critical function for SLM2 in the inhibitory control of short-term episodic memories.</p><p id="P21">We propose that acquisition of a cell type-specific complement of RNA binding proteins represents a critical element of the terminal gene battery established during development which shapes trans-synaptic modules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

Data quality, reads repartition (e.g., for potential ribosomal contamination), and insert size estimation were performed using FastQC v0.11.8, Picard-Tools v1.119, Samtools 1.13 and rseqc v2.3.9. This first quality check identified one sample in the pool of DCamK2 which displayed an accumulation of reads on the 3’end and displayed higher ribosomal contamination. Thus, this sample was excluded from further analyses. Reads were mapped using STARv2.4.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> on the mm10 Mouse genome assembly. Reads were mapped using STARv2.4.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> against the exons defined in the proprietary Mouse FAST DB v2016_1 database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, using a mismatch cutoff of 2 and discarding reads with 10 or more alignments. The minimum chimeric segment length was 15. Read counts were summarized using featureCounts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> in two stages. First, unique reads per exon were counted. In the second stage, multimapping reads were fractionally allocated to exons based on the distribution of unique counts of exons within a gene. Total counts were then calculated based on three constitutivity classes defined in FAST DB: class 2 includes exons present in more than 75% of annotated transcripts for a gene (“constitutive”), class 1 includes exons present in 50-75% of transcripts (“semi-constitutive”), and class 0 includes exons present in less than 50% of transcripts (“alternative”). Total counts per gene were summed from constitutivity class 2 exons if their FPKM values exceed 96% of the background FPKM based on intergenic regions. If counts from class 2 exons were insufficient to exceed the detection threshold, class 1 and eventually class 0 exon counts were included to reach the detection threshold.</p><p id="P42">Data was deposited at GEO: GSE209870</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p id="P43">Differential regulation of gene expression was performed as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Briefly, for each gene present in the proprietary Mouse FAST DB v2016_1 annotations, reads aligning on constitutive exons of the gene are counted. Based on these read counts, normalization and differential gene expression are performed using DESEq2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. Background expression was defined by reads aligning to intergenic regions, thus, only genes are considered as expressed if their RPKM value (reads per kilo base of transcript per million mapped reads) is greater than 96% of the background RPKM value based on intergenic regions. Only genes expressed in at least 3 out of 4 biological replicates for Grik4 and SST; and in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates for CamK2 were further analyzed. For all expressed genes, DESeq2 values were generated (values were normalized by the total number of mapped reads of all samples). Fold change in gene expression was calculated by pairwise comparisons, comparing the normalized expression value in the respective WT condition to the corresponding ΔSLM2 condition and p-value (unpaired Student’s t-test) and adjusted p-value (Benjamin and Hochberg) were calculated.

The exon analysis takes reads mapping to exonic regions and to exon-exon junctions into account. When reads map onto exon-exon junctions, the reads were assigned to both exons and the minimum number of nucleotides is 7 in order that a read is considered mapped to an exon. An exon was considered to be expressed if the FPKM value (Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) was greater than 96% of the background FPKM value based on intergenic regions. Only exons that were expressed in at least 3 out of 4 biological replicates for Grik4 and SST; and in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates for CamK2 were further analyzed. Furthermore, for every expressed exon a splicing index (SI) was calculated: This is the ratio between read density on the exon of interest (=number of reads on the exon / exon length in nucleotides) and read density on constitutive exons of the same gene (with constitutive exons defined in FAST DB). The second type of alternative splicing analysis is the Pattern analysis. This type of analysis is taking known splicing patterns annotated in the FAST DB database into account <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>.
