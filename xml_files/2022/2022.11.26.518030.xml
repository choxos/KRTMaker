The tropical yellow fever mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and the invasive Asian tiger mosquito <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> pose a large threat to human health by transmitting medically important arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses including Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Research has specially focused on these two urban mosquito species, however, also other <italic>Aedes</italic> species are becoming increasingly widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and their role in arbovirus transmission requires further attention.</p><p id="P6">The Asian bush mosquito <italic>Aedes japonicus,</italic> which originates in Northeast Asia, is a highly invasive species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. During the past two decades, this mosquito species quickly spread to North America and Europe, where it established large, permanent populations despite intensive control efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> is capable of transmitting multiple arboviruses including West Nile virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], Japanese encephalitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], Usutu virus (USUV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and CHIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to understand the biology of this exotic mosquito species in greater detail.</p><p id="P7">In addition to arboviruses, mosquitoes can also carry insect-specific viruses (ISVs). Whereas arboviruses are maintained in transmission cycles between arthropods and vertebrate animals or humans, ISVs do not replicate in vertebrates, and only infect insects. ISVs can persistently infect mosquito populations and have recently received increasing attention due to their potential effects on host physiology and arbovirus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Exploring the diversity of ISVs may also help to better understand the evolution of arboviruses and to develop new strategies for arbovirus control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Extensive virome analyses that have been performed for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] showed that both mosquito species harbour a large diversity of ISVs. For <italic>Ae. japonicus,</italic> however, an in-depth virome analysis is still missing, although a first glimpse has revealed the presence of a novel narnavirus in this mosquito. This <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> narnavirus 1 (AejapNV1) was discovered in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> from the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and was also found in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> from Japan shortly thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], indicating its close association with <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. AejapNV1 belongs to a novel group of unique, ambigrammatic narnaviruses, which not only contain an open reading frame (ORF) coding for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) on the positive strand but also a very long ORF with unknown function on the (reverse-complement) negative strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Metagenomic approaches have played an essential role in uncovering the virome of vector mosquitoes and the discovery of many novel ISVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Despite the success of these approaches, certain aspects of virome analysis remain challenging to fulfil using large-scale nucleic acid sequencing, such as: the detection and classification of highly divergent viral sequences that do not align to any known reference sequence (i.e., the viral ‘dark matter’), the association of sequences from different genomic segments of the same virus, and the differentiation of exogenous viruses from endogenous viral elements (EVEs).</p><p id="P10">These limitations can be overcome using small RNA-based metagenomics. Virus-derived small RNAs are produced in mosquitoes when viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates are recognized and cleaved by Dicer-2, a key protein of the antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, which results in the production of 21 nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The formation of viral siRNAs is a signature of active virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. In addition to viral siRNAs, viral PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of ~24-29 nt in length are also produced for some viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Thus, small RNA sequencing detects products derived from host antiviral pathways that discriminates EVEs and allows for sequence-independent characterization of viral sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P11">In the current study, we applied a small RNA-based metagenomic approach to analyze the virome of wild-caught <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> mosquitoes from populations in the Netherlands and France, and identified AejapNV1 and three novel virus species. Interestingly, for AejapNV1, not only the primary genome segment (S1) encoding the RdRp was found, but we also discovered an ambigrammatic secondary genome segment (S2) with unknown function. S2 did not align to any known sequence in public databases. Still, it could be associated with the same virus on the basis of similar (di)nucleotide composition in S1 and S2, and by applying unsupervised clustering techniques using small RNA features generated by our small RNA metagenomic approach. Additionally, we found sequences derived from two putative, novel virus species, and together with the other four discovered viruses, we characterized their genome organisation and small RNA profiles. Finally, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to study the prevalence of these viruses in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> adults, larvae and eggs.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Small RNA library preparation and high-throughput sequencing</title><p id="P12"><italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> adult female mosquitoes from Strasbourg, France, were collected using human landing catches (HLCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and further identified using morphological characteristics. Two pools were made prior to RNA extraction, one containing two (FR_01) individuals and another containing four (FR_02) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, mosquitoes were transferred to 1.5 ml screw-capped tubes containing ceramic beads (1.4 mm in diameter, Omini) and ice-cold TRIzol (Invitrogen). Mosquitoes were grinded using a Precellys Evolution Homogenizer at 6,500 rpm in 3 cycles of 20 seconds each. Then, 10 μg of glycogen (Ambion) was added to the aqueous layer of each sample to facilitate pellet visualization upon RNA precipitation. RNAs were resuspended in RNAse-free water (Ambion) and stored at -80°C until further notice. Total RNA was used as input for library preparation utilizing the kit NEBnext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina following the recommended protocol, except for one minor modification: the 5’ adapter was replaced by an analogue that contains 6 extra nucleotides at the 3’ extremity to improve barcoding precision, which is sequenced along with the cloned small RNA. Libraries were sequenced at the GenomEast sequencing platform at the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in Strasbourg, France, using Illumina HiSeq 4000 equipment. The <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> small RNA libraries from Lelystad, the Netherlands, reanalyzed in this study, were previously deposited in the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA545039 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].

Sequences with an average Phred quality below 20, ambiguous nucleotides, and/or a length shorter than 15 nt were discarded. The remaining sequences were mapped to genome sequences of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (AaeL5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], and bacterial reference genomes using Bowtie v1.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Unmapped reads from the previous step were assembled in contigs combining metaSPAdes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and Velvet v1.0.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. More details about k-mers and read sizes combinations for assemblies using small RNAs in the current work can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Contigs larger than 200 nt were characterized based on sequence similarity against the NCBI <italic>nt</italic> database using BLAST+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] and against <italic>nr</italic> using DIAMOND (mode <italic>--very-sensitive</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], considering significant hits with <italic>e-values</italic> lower than 1e<sup>-5</sup> for nucleotide comparison or 1e<sup>-3</sup> for amino acid comparison. For small RNA size profile and coverage analysis, reads unmapped to mosquito and bacterial genomes were aligned to viral and unknown contigs using Bowtie v1.3, allowing one mismatch. Size profiles of small RNAs matching reference sequences and 5’ nt base preference were calculated using in-house Perl v5.16.3, BioPerl library v1.6.924 and R v4.0.5 scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JPbio/small_RNA_MetaVir/">https://github.com/JPbio/small_RNA_MetaVir/</ext-link>). Plots were generated in R using ggplot2 v3.3.5 package. For manual curation of putative viral contigs, top five BLAST and DIAMOND hits were analyzed to rule out the similarity to other organisms; ORF organization and small RNA profiles (size distribution and coverage) were analyzed to differentiate exogenous from endogenous viruses and check for inconsistencies. Contigs containing truncated ORFs and small RNA profiles without symmetric small RNA peaks at 21 nt were considered putative EVEs as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. For more details on manual curation steps, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Redundancy of curated viral contigs was removed using CD-HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] requiring 90% coverage of the smaller sequence (<italic>-aS</italic>) with 90% of global identity (<italic>-c</italic>). Representative unique contigs from the previous step were used for co-occurrence analysis based on small RNA abundancy in each of the small RNA libraries using Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million reads (RPKM) values for reads ranging from 20 to 22 nt aligned to the viral and unknown contigs. Hierarchical contig clusters using RPKM values were constructed in R using Euclidean distance and average method. Z-scores were calculated based on the frequency of each small RNA size from 15 to 35 nt mapped to representative viral and unknown contigs considering each strand polarity separately using the library where the contig was originally assembled. Strand polarity for contig comparisons was adjusted based on the reads abundance per strand and coding ORFs direction of each contig. Heatmaps for RPKM and Z-score values were plotted using the package ComplexHeatmap in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. As an attempt of viral sequence extension as proposed by Sardi et al., 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], contigs grouped in the same cluster with sequence similarity hits to the same virus were submitted to a new assembly round using SPAdes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] with the parameter <italic>--trusted-contigs</italic> using all the libraries in which that viral sequences were found.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>piRNA analysis</title><p id="P14">Sequence overlaps and signatures of viral-derived small RNAs were analysed to determine the presence of piRNAs.

Although no contigs corresponding to a putative segment L belonging to AejapBV2 were found in our libraries, we successfully assembled entire M and S genomic segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

The L, M and S segments of AejapBV1 (blue) and the M and S segments of AejapBV2 (purple) showed CpG underrepresentation and a relatively low GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). AejapTV1 (yellow) greatly differed from these bunyaviruses in its CpG usage and GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), adding yet another piece of evidence at sequence level that, despite clustering together based on co-occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), AejapTV1 and AejapBV2 are indeed different viruses.

Together with the similarities noted before, these observations indicate that this contig is part of AejapNV1 and was thus named AejapNV1 segment 2 (S2), while the sequence encoding the RdRp is now referred to as segment 1 (S1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For S1, we observed a strong bias of mapped 24-29 nt small RNAs for the positive RdRp strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Likewise, S2 also showed preference of mapped 24-29 nt small RNAs towards one specific strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Analysis of the small RNA coverage profiles of AejapNV1 S1 and S2 for each small RNA length separately indicated a bias of small RNAs (18-35 nt in length) towards the same specific strand for each small RNA length, except for 21 nt small RNAs, which were found in similar quantities on both strands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

This asymmetric pattern for small RNAs sized 18-20 nt and 22-35 nt is likely caused by non-specific degradation of viral RNAs, indicating the relative abundance and exposure of each strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. For AejapNV1 S1, the small RNA bias was indeed towards the strand encoding the RdRp, which is considered the positive strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore we propose that the positive strand of AejapNV1 S2 is the one to which most small RNAs mapped.</p><p id="P32">To further investigate whether the putative S2 of AejapNV1 was indeed related to S1, the 5’ and 3’ termini of both segments were analyzed for the presence of conserved narnaviral motifs.

For all viruses and segments analyzed, short runs of G and C nucleotides were present at the 5’ and 3’ termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, indicated by asterisks). Based on RNA structure modelling, a conserved SL structure was predicted to occur at the 3’ terminus of AejapNV1 S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, 6C</xref>). Similar conserved SL structures at the 3’ terminus, differing in size and with covarying base pairs in the stem region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), have previously been observed for CxNV1 S1 and S2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], ONLV1, ONLV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and Scer20SNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], and were also found for XaNLV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

A slippery site (GGAAAAC), present just before the stop codon of the capsid ORF, corresponded to the heptameric consensus motif typical for -1 ribosomal frameshifts and represents the area where the ribosome shifts back into another reading frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].

For the mosquito-associated, bisegmented, ambigrammatic CxNV1, the presence of the primary RdRp segment was found to be required for replication of the secondary (‘Robin’) segment in <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito cells, whereas the primary segment could persist in cell culture without the presence of the secondary segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. In our study, the primary and secondary genome segment of AejapNV1 co-occurred at very high frequency in field-collected <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> mosquitoes, which is in accordance with previous findings for CxNV1 in wild-caught mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>], thus suggesting that the secondary segment is of key importance for virus survival in the field.</p><p id="P42">Despite some conserved features between AejapNV1 S2 and CxNV1 S2, such as the genomic termini and ambigrammatic ORF structure, these sequences are highly divergent at nucleotide and amino acid sequence level. Such divergence raises questions about the origin and function of this secondary genome segment. Here we analyzed the conservation between polypeptides encoded by AejapNV1 S2 and CxNV1 S2 at the structure levels. Conserved motifs at secondary and tertiary levels between proteins encoded by the fORFs were observed when comparing the presence and synteny of predicted α-helix regions and the core structure predicted by AlphaFold. Interestingly, the rORF of CxNV1 S2 may not encode a functional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>]. Nevertheless, the function of the secondary genome segment of AejapNV1 and CxNV1 remains unknown, and future studies are needed to elucidate its role and evolutionary origin. These narnavirus secondary segments belong to the dark matter of metagenomics, since sequence similarity methods, such as local alignments, were not able to associate the AejapNV1 S2 sequence to the CxNV1 S2 reference in GenBank. Even the application of the powerful tool AlphaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] to predict tertiary structures and infer protein function, was limited by the lack of similar sequences to ORFs in AejapNV1 S2. AlphaFold relies on initial alignments to protein sequence and structure databases, such as Uniref90 and the Protein Data Bank, to acquire atomic tridimensional data and perform structural assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. This could also explain the lack of confident predictions for our fORFs and also for any attempt of predicting structures for highly divergent sequences. This is a good example of how bioinformatics pipelines for viral sequence identification in metagenomic data still have room for improvement. Increased knowledge about the viral metagenomic dark matter is paramount to allow large-scale automated generalizations of the evolution and function of divergent viral sequences. Of note, our clustering approach based on small RNA profiles and co-occurrence was critical to identify the unknown contig corresponding to segment 2 of AejapNV1. This reinforces the power of small RNA-based approaches to recover viral sequences from the metagenomic dark matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Still, the origin of a substantial portion of the dark matter present in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> remains enigmatic. Despite the presence of an siRNA profile, we could not clearly associate 21 unknown contigs to any defined viral species in this study. Further studies will be necessary to determine if these unknown sequences with siRNA profile are of viral origin. One possible explanation derives from the lack of a reference genome available for <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, implying that some of those unknown contigs could have originated from unknown repetitive elements in the genome and/or overlapping mRNA fragments that may produce endogenous siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>].</p><p id="P44">Our small RNA-based approach also pointed to the presence of two distinct bunyaviruses in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. However, we could not identify a potential L segment encoding an RdRp for AejapBV2. Based on previous successful detection of segmented viruses from different families including bunyaviruses using our small RNA-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], it is unlikely that the segment L of AejapBV2 was present in the samples and remained undetected. In addition, we successfully assembled complete M and S segments for AejapBV2. Segment reassortments between bunyaviruses are frequently described and it has been suggested that most if not all bunyaviruses currently present have arisen from reassortments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. Given the ability of bunyaviruses to reassort genome segments, AejapBV2 could possibly use the RdRp of AejapBV1 for replication. However, AejapBV1 and AejapBV2 belong to two different bunyavirus families, <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and <italic>Phasmaviridae,</italic> respectively, which might render complementation or reassortment less likely. In addition, this hypothesis implies that AejapBV2 replication is dependent on the presence of the L segment of AejapBV1, but we could not detect AejapBV1 in our <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> NL_02 small RNA library whilst AejapBV2 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Future studies will be needed to elucidate the replication strategy of AejapBV2 in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>.</p><p id="P45">Remarkably, AejapBV1, AejapBV2, AejapAV1 and AejapRV1 produced abundant piRNAs with strong signals of a ping-pong mechanism. Notably, not all viruses induce the production of piRNAs during infection in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. A similar small RNA profile was described for another bunyavirus, Phasi Charoen-like virus, infecting <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and the authors reasoned that the piRNA biogenesis could be linked to ovary tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. It would be of interest to investigate if the piRNA profiles observed in our study correlate with tissue tropism in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. Interestingly, there is a striking difference in the profile of piRNAs produced from the segments M and S of AejapBV1 and AejapBV2, which suggests that these viruses infect different tissues in the mosquito [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P46">Screening of wild-caught <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> from the Netherlands indicated a high prevalence of AejapNV1 and AejapTV1 across all tested mosquito life stages, suggesting efficient transmission of these viruses, possibly vertically. Such a phenomenon was described for narnaviruses discovered in fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>] and nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>], for which vertical transmission has been shown. The high percentage of mosquitoes that tested positive for AejapNV1 in our study is also in accordance with a recent study in Japan, where all tested <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> mosquitoes harboured AejapNV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P47">In our study, AejapNV1, AejapTV1, AejapAV1, AejapBV1 and AejapBV2 were all detected in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> mosquitoes from the Netherlands and France. This indicates a high stability of the virome across mosquito populations, which has also been observed for other mosquito species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and may suggest that these viruses have co-evolved with their mosquito host. Although the newly discovered virus species belong to different virus families and are thus highly diverse, they form a stable viral community in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> despite active antiviral RNAi responses, hence suggesting that these viruses should be considered important constituents of the biology of <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> mosquito populations.</p></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P48">This study uncovered the virome of the invasive Asian bush mosquito <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, a species that can transmit multiple arboviruses and has become increasingly prevalent in North America and Europe. We discovered a highly diverse virome in <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> with viruses from at least five families: <italic>Narnaviridae</italic>, <italic>Totiviridae</italic>, <italic>Xinmoviridae</italic>, <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and <italic>Phasmaviridae</italic>. We showed a collection of viruses not only diverse at the sequence level but also in RNAi responses generated by <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, providing the basis for future studies to elucidate the immune mechanisms involved in dealing with multiple viral infections. By discovering and characterizing AejapNV1 S2, we showed the strength of our small RNA-based approach to access the “viral dark matter” of insect metagenomes. Beyond associating a highly divergent viral genomic segment to a single virus, we provided evidence that it replicates in the host by showing its siRNA signature. Our study establishes solid ground to explore whether these resident viruses could impact arbovirus transmission by <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. Infection with these likely ISVs might add yet another complex variable to the risk assessment of arbovirus outbreaks caused by <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, and future studies are needed to dissect the role of the virome in arbovirus transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary_Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS157710-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS157710-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Marleen Abma-Henkens for her assistance with <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> collection in the field, Pieter Rouweler and other members of the insect rearing group from the Laboratory of Entomology from Wageningen University &amp; Research for maintaining the <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> colony, Giel Göertz for his contributions during the start of the project, Monique van Oers for her continued interest in the project, and Eric Snijder, Andrew Firth, Nina Lukhovitskaya and Katherine Brown for fruitful scientific discussions.
