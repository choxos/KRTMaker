In the pituitary, a central regulator of endocrine axes, a population of adult SCs undergo activation following target organ ablation, providing a well-characterized paradigm to study regeneration in a multi-organ system. Here we used single cell technologies to characterize SC heterogeneity and regeneration modalities. We consequently performed lineage tracing experiments. Our result show that SC differentiation occurs more frequently than previously thought. In regenerative conditions, differentiation is both increased and more diverse than lineage tracing experiments demonstrated. Detailed examination of SC progeny demonstrate that nascent cells maintenance is an important regulatory step controlling SC-derived regeneration, highlighting a trophic role for the microenvironment. Analyses of cell trajectories further predict modalities, and potential new players involved in regeneration. Our model provides a unique system to study the influence of evolving physiological states on the mechanisms of SC regeneration.</p><p id="P2">Teaser: Pituitary stem cells are heterogeneous and differentiate more than formerly thought but maintenance of their progeny is selective.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The pituitary gland controls the three major endocrine axes, reproduction, stress and metabolism, and is involved in homeostasis; all under control of the hypothalamus. Its function requires modulation of hormonal output over short and long terms, and this is regulated at several levels, including rates and patterns of hormone secretion, synthesis and storage, and changes in endocrine cell numbers. Two different mechanisms are known to underlie endocrine cell emergence: division of endocrine cells and differentiation from resident SCs. Under normal and stable conditions, it is thought that division from endocrine cell types is sufficient for the typical low cell turnover seen in the pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This has been directly shown in corticotrophs using a genetic trick where cell division induces apoptosis of POMC expressing cells. A gradual loss of corticotrophs is observed in these pituitaries in support of the role of these endocrine cells in their own replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In agreement, long term lineage tracing of adult SOX2 and SOX9 +ve pituitary SCs in steady-state conditions suggests that SCs differentiate rarely and thus do not significantly participate in cell turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Furthermore, adult ablation of the SCs does not appear to affect pituitary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In contrast, when the regenerative potential of the gland is stimulated, either by endocrine cell ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) or target organ ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), SC-derived new endocrine cells of the appropriate type emerge. In this latter paradigm, differentiation from SCs appears to be the main process underlying emergence of new corticotrophs after adrenalectomy (Ax) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), providing a well characterized multi-organ system to explore mechanisms of regeneration.</p><p id="P4">Here, we explore the characteristics of pituitary SC fate acquisition using single cell approaches combined with lineage tracing analyses. We observe that SOX9 +ve pituitary SCs comprise several functionally distinct sub-populations, located in the ventral and dorsal part of the epithelium lining the pituitary cleft and in the anterior pituitary parenchyma. We then explored mechanisms underlying SC mobilization following target organ ablation through characterizing cell trajectories and GRNs potentially involved in cell fate acquisition. We observed that while fate acquisition of the targeted cell type (corticotrophs after Ax and gonadotrophs after gonadectomy) was efficiently induced, differentiation toward all endocrine cell types unexpectedly also took place. Examination of longer-term outcomes using lineage tracing further showed that only a proportion of the differentiated progeny is retained, specifically that of the targeted cell type. More precisely, we only observe SC-derived corticotrophs after Ax, and lactotrophs in females, likely highlighting oestrogen involvement. Therefore, while pituitary SC differentiation appears both more frequent and diverse than previously thought, our results suggest that the selective maintenance of nascent cells, according to perceived physiological need and likely sex-dependent hormonal cues, is an important regulatory step controlling the regenerative response from SCs. Our model thus allows characterisation of this response following pathophysiological manipulations that may well relate to normal life-changing events, such as puberty, pregnancy and lactation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Distinct regulatory pathways govern AL and IL SC identity</title><p id="P5">The anterior lobes of three <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> adult male pituitaries were dissociated and the transcriptome of single GFP +ve cells analysed after fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). After quality checks, 1993 cells were retained for further analysis; clustering was performed by generating UMAP plots. Three major clusters were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). Co-expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> in clusters 0 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>), representing 69% of the cells, suggested that these were likely to represent SCs. The remaining cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), representing 24% of the dataset, comprised cells where <italic>Sox</italic>9 was detected, but where <italic>Sox2</italic> was greatly reduced or absent. Finally, cells each expressing a different hormone and the corresponding lineage specifying factors, were grouped within a single smaller cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) representing 3% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). SOX9 is not expressed in any endocrine cell in quiescent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, we observed some rare SOX9;ACTH +ve cells, and more numerous GFP;ACTH +ve cells in <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> animals exclusively after activation of the SCs by pituitary target organ ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.1</xref>). This suggests that differentiating, and recently differentiated cells are present in the SOX9iresGFP fraction due to persistence of the GFP. Therefore, the cells present in cluster 3 are likely to represent cells committed toward an endocrine fate, with the largest population (41% of cluster 3 cells) expressing <italic>Prolactin.</italic></p><p id="P6">The two SC clusters were further explored. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>) shows that clusters 0 and 2 are relatively similar and are distinguished by differences in levels of expression of specific genes. <italic>Aldh1a2,</italic> encoding for an enzyme involved in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, and the transcription factor <italic>Msxl</italic> were preferentially present in cluster 0, while <italic>Ednrb,</italic> encoding for the endothelin B receptor, and the cell adhesion molecule <italic>Claudin3</italic> were both expressed at higher levels in cluster 2. RA is required during pituitary morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and <italic>Msx1</italic> interacts with SOX2 for <italic>Prop1</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), while nothing is known about <italic>Ednrb</italic> or <italic>Claudin3</italic> in pituitary SCs. In the gland, expression of the four markers is restricted to SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>). In the epithelium lining the cleft, cluster 0 markers ALDH1a2 and MSX1 are expressed exclusively on the AL side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2 A,B</xref>), while cluster 2 markers EDNRB and CLAUDIN-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2 C,D</xref>) are present on both sides. In the parenchyma ALDH1a2, MSX1 and CLAUDIN-3 co-localise with SOX2/9 while expression of EDNRB is not detectable. These results suggest that cluster 0 is enriched in anterior lobe SCs, while cluster 2 has a more generic pituitary SC identity.</p><p id="P7">Pathway analysis in cluster 0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Table.1</xref>) highlighted activity of the NOTCH and WNT pathways and presence of Ephrin signalling, as previously reported in pituitary SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Cluster 2 cells are characterised by expression of cytoskeleton remodelling and adhesion genes consistent with the EMT-like process required during pituitary progenitor cell fate acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In conclusion, regionalisation of these two SC subpopulations is functionally underlined by the activity of specific regulatory pathways.</p><p id="P8">Folliculo-stellate (FS) cells are specialised AL glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). These express S100b in the rat, but not in the mouse ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.2</xref>). To clarify their relationship with SCs, we examined expression of <italic>Aldolase C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and of <italic>Slc152a,</italic> which encodes a transporter responsible for the FS specific import of AMCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Both are selectively present in SCs, in clusters 0 and 2, implying that in the mouse FS and SCs are overlapping populations.</p><p id="P9">In conclusion, single-cell analysis of the <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> pituitary fraction successfully resolved heterogeneity of this population, suggesting differential activity of new pathways, and clarified the relationship between SC with the FS cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A novel population of parenchymal SOX9;PDGFRβ +ve cells</title><p id="P10">Cluster 1, representing 25% of the cells, is characterised by expression of PDGFRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). <italic>In situ,</italic> PDGFRβ;SOX9 +ve cells are exclusively detected in the parenchyma. Expression of SOX9 in these double +ve cells is weaker than in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>) and SOX2 is not detected in them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In contrast with the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, only 8±1.62% SD of parenchymal SOX9 +ve cells express PDGFRβ in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>). This discrepancy could be due either to an over-representation of cluster 1 cells, because epithelial SCs are more difficult to recover than parenchymal cells, or to the difficulty in detecting the cells by immunofluorescence. We observe significantly fewer PDGFRβ;SOX9 +ve cells in females than in males (1.3±0.6% SD, p= 0.029, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>). PDGFRβ +ve pituitary cells are known to comprise a mural vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and in agreement, some SOX9;PDGFRβ cells display a pericyte like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>). In the embryo, vascular and mural cells have an extra-Rathke’s pouch origin, as they emerge from immigrating neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Because cluster 1 cells do not express the generic pituitary marker <italic>Pitx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref>), we analysed a potential neural crest origin by performing WNT1-Cre lineage tracing. 79 ± 3.1% SEM of SOX9;PDGFRβ cells (n=130 cells from 4 males) derive from WNT1-Cre +ve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3C, F</xref>) while in females only 47.5 ± 5.5% SEM of the cells derive from the neural crest (n= 38 cells from 2 females, p= 0.036). Therefore, we propose that cluster 1 cells represent a sexually dimorphic mural network with a dual embryonic origin.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>All endocrine cell types are present in the <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> +ve compartment after SC mobilization</title><p id="P11">We then performed sc-RNAseq on activated SCs. Target organ ablation induces a transient proliferative wave in the gland, mostly affecting SCs, which can then give rise to new endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We analysed the transcriptome of <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> male cells 4 days after removing the adrenals, the testes or both. We selected an average of 50% extra cells compared to our previous dataset (about 1.5% of the whole population) to include cells expressing GFP weakly, and thus potentially differentiating. We integrated these datasets with that obtained from unchallenged animals and obtained a similar clustering of SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.3A</xref>). A pairwise comparison for proportion test limited to SC clusters, comparable across all the datasets since they express high levels of GFP, demonstrates a significant increase in proliferative cells after target organ ablation, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). We also observe the emergence of distinct hormone +ve clusters representing in total 25 to 30% of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A,B</xref>). Target organ ablation is associated with increased secretion, and sometimes cell numbers, of the endocrine population regulating the resected organ. However, regardless of the glands removed, all endocrine cell lineages emerge in the Sox9iresGFP +ve fraction. While we expected <italic>Pomc</italic> +ve cells to prominently feature after Ax, these were outnumbered by <italic>Prl</italic> and <italic>LHb;FSHb</italic> +ve cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 3C</xref>). Similarly, gonadectomies were expected to trigger commitment toward the gonadotroph cell fate, but <italic>Gh</italic> +ve cells were mostly observed. To characterise these <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic>;hormone +ve cells we compared them with endocrine cells by integrating our datasets with one from whole pituitaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic>;hormone +ve cells cluster with endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C, D</xref>). Therefore, they represent differentiated cells, at least transcriptionally. In conclusion, target organ ablation induces differentiation of SCs, but there is an unexpected lack of specificity in the endocrine cell types produced, with all hormonal markers being up-regulated.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Analyses of cell trajectories after Ax</title><p id="P12">We decided to focus on Ax because it represents the most efficient stimulus of SC differentiation after target organ ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). We added a new time point at day 2 after Ax and a sham control. More cells were collected (about 2% of the whole AL population) and sequenced in these new datasets (5000 and 6000 cells) which were integrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>) with our initial dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>) and the one performed 4 days after Ax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). UMAP clustering indicated that SCs were present in four distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.4</xref>). In addition to the <italic>Ednrb</italic> and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> clusters, two SC clusters (SC3 and SC4) emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>). These were mostly populated by cells from the new datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.5</xref>). SC3 was characterised by higher expression of markers also present in the <italic>Ednrb</italic> and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> clusters. SC4, mostly derived from the Ax+48h00 dataset, showed co-expression of SC and endocrine markers suggesting that it represents cells in a transitioning phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.4</xref>). Finally, endocrine cell clusters were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.4</xref>), as observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In sham operated animals, 4.5% of hormone expressing cells, mostly <italic>Prl</italic> +ve, were present, confirming our observations in unchallenged animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Table 2</xref>). 48 hours after Ax, the proportion of hormone +ve cells had increased to 11%, and this had doubled after 4 days. Because expression of Sox9iresGFP depends on <italic>Sox9</italic> and is thus not cumulative, as in classical lineage tracing experiments, this increasing proportion means that commitment toward differentiation augments in the 4 days following ablation. A pairwise proportion test between the 2 new datasets, sorted identically on the same day, showed that a shift occurs from SC4 where the proportion of cells from the Ax dataset is significantly increased, fitting with its transitioning phase profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.4</xref>). At this shorter time point, 48 h00 after adrenal ablation, corticotrophs are the most significantly increased cell type, while 4 days after surgery they were outnumbered by lactotrophs. This sharp and transient increase could represent the specific SC response to adrenal ablation.</p><p id="P14">We then performed trajectory analyses after principal component analysis (PCA) using Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Trajectories finishing at each endocrine cell type were discovered, with a common root through SC clusters <italic>Ednrb, Aldh1a2,</italic> proliferative cells and SC4, then ending at each endocrine cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig.6</xref>). In the corticotroph trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5D</xref>), the expression pattern of 2245 genes significantly correlates with pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>). The expression of known SC markers (<italic>Ednrb</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>) and signalling pathway members (<italic>Notch2, Hes1, Hey1</italic> and <italic>Wnt4, Fzd2, Sfrp5</italic>) was gradually lost. Pathway analyses further suggest keratin filament remodelling, in agreement with epithelial to parenchymal transition during differentiation. <italic>Ismn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and <italic>Prop1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), which are involved in cell fate acquisition, are also present during early phases. Conversely, the corticotroph specifier and marker genes <italic>Neurod1, Ascl1, Tbx19, Pomc</italic> and <italic>Creb3l2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) are upregulated as cells differentiate. A sharp transition occurs as <italic>Prop1</italic> is upregulated and is characterised by a transient up-regulation of <italic>Pou1f1</italic> lineage and gonadotroph (<italic>Fshb</italic>) genes. This could reflect permissive chromatin remodelling as endocrine cell fate acquisition occurs.</p><p id="P15">SCENIC analysis was then performed to explore GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5G</xref>). As expected <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>9</italic> regulons featured in SC clusters while <italic>Ascl1, Neurod1</italic> and <italic>Creb3l2</italic> were present in corticotrophs. The thyroid (<italic>Thra</italic>) and the androgen (<italic>Ar</italic>) hormone receptor regulons featured in differentiating SCs, suggesting that SCs can respond to peripheral signals. New pituitary GNRs were also discovered, such as those involving <italic>Runx1</italic> and <italic>Irf9</italic> whose expression was validated in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5G, E</xref>). RUNX1 (RUNt-related transcription tactor 1) is known to control adult skin SC maintenance by regulating WNT signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), whereas IRFs (Interferon Regulatory Factors) are modulators of cell growth and differentiation beside their anti-viral functions. IRF9 associates with phosphorylated STAT1:STAT2 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) dimers, which are both present in our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Finally, several RA factors were present, supporting RA involvement during endocrine cell differentiation.</p><p id="P16">In conclusion, by adding new datasets, we validated our previous observations suggesting a low differentiation rate of SCs, mostly into lactotrophs in the intact animals. We refined the dynamics of the regenerative response after mobilization, showing a transient peak of corticotroph differentiation 48 hours after Ax and, importantly, we were able to infer cell trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Selective maintenance of SC progeny</title><p id="P17">To examine predictions from our transcriptomic analyses, we performed two different types of lineage tracing experiment. First, we directly assessed expression of hormonal markers on plated <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> FACSorted single cells by immunofluorescence in males and females, 4 days after Ax or sham-surgery. Second, to follow mobilized SCs further, we used <italic>Sox9<sup>ires-CreERT2/+</sup>;R26R<sup>EYFP/+</sup></italic> animals and examined progeny 10 to 11 days after Cre induction (a week after surgery since induction is mostly performed for 3 days before surgery).</p><p id="P18">All hormone +ve cell types were found in the GFP +ve fraction in both experimental and control animals, which matches our transcriptomic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6 A, B</xref>). Following Ax, the number of POMC +ve cells increased the most, in agreement with our earliest dataset (Ax+48h). However, even if less efficiently stimulated, the proportion of most other endocrine cell types was comparable to that of corticotrophs. This again reflected our transcriptomic data. More precisely, we also observed a slight increase in somatotroph emergence in both sexes, while lactotrophs appear to increase only in females; and the low LH +ve cell numbers are not affected by target organ ablation.</p><p id="P19">We then carried out lineage tracing in <italic>Sox9<sup>ires-CreERT2/+</sup>; R26R<sup>EYFP/+</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6C</xref>). In contrast with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A</xref>), examination of pituitary sections exclusively revealed the presence of POMC;eYFP +ve corticotrophs after Ax, in comparable numbers in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6C</xref>). In females, we additionally observed lactotrophs, and did so even without performing target organ ablation. Quantification of lactotroph emergence on dissociated pituitaries confirmed the sex bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6D</xref>). Correcting for CreERT2 induction efficiency, we estimate that in females SCs contribute to 0.6% of the total population of lactotrophs and these SC-derived lactotrophs represent 2% of the eYFP +ve population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The two genetic tools we used, <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>ires-CreERT2/+</sup>,</italic> display inherent distinctions, such as use of high-dose of the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, and purposes, where these may impair direct comparisons. However, while results from both transcriptomic analyses and immunofluorescence demonstrate that endocrine cells of all types are produced in comparable numbers in the short term, we clearly observe that corticotrophs are the only endocrine cells remaining in long-term lineage tracing experiments in males. This indicates a selective maintenance of nascent endocrine cells.</p><p id="P21">To further explore the sex bias in SC-derived lactotrophs, we administered tamoxifen to P0 <italic>Sox9<sup>ires-CreERT2/+</sup>; R26R<sup>EYFP/+</sup></italic> pups and quantified differentiation into lactotrophs once they reached adulthood. There was no significant difference in the proportion of SC-derived lactotrophs between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>), as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Therefore, male SC-derived lactotrophs can be produced, but this is temporally restricted. Furthermore, because the proportion of lactotrophs generated from male and female pups is similar, this suggests that tamoxifen, which can interfere with estrogen action, induces lactotroph emergence. If lactotroph emergence was a continuous process in females their proportion would have been far superior to that observed in males. Our results thus reveal a temporal window of sensitivity in males, while female SCs remain responsive to the lactotroph promoting effect of tamoxifen until adulthood. It is unclear how E2 signalling is altered, and whether SC differentiation is induced or maintenance of nascent lactotrophs permitted.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>SCs and corticotrophs interact</title><p id="P22">The selective maintenance of specific nascent SC progeny, while the rest are lost, suggests that survival is dependent on local cues in their microenvironment. In the context of Ax, the corticotrophs are a likely source of signals. We thus re-examined our transcriptomic datasets, screening for signalling pathways potentially activated in SCs by corticotrophs. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>Met</italic> is selectively upregulated in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A, B</xref>) while its ligand <italic>Hgf</italic> is present both in corticotrophs and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7C</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>)), suggesting interactions between these cell types. Furthermore, <italic>Met</italic> is present at higher levels in SCs after Ax, when these become proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A</xref>). Because there are more corticotrophs after Ax, it is very likely that levels of HGF will increase too. Therefore, the MET pathway could mediate instructive or trophic actions of corticotrophs on SCs. The receptor and its ligand are both widely expressed in human pituitary adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">While adult pituitary SCs appear superfluous for cell-turnover in the unchallenged animal, their regenerative potential can be stimulated, for example when the function of certain endocrine axes is compromised, such as when adrenals or gonads are ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Here we have characterized SC heterogeneity and the modalities of endocrine cell emergence, by examining Sox9iresGFP single cells. We observe that a small percentage of pituitary SCs differentiate in the unchallenged animal and that this proportion increases when SCs are mobilized. The paradigm we applied for SC mobilization, target organ ablation, is known to trigger a specific response in the pituitary: adrenal ablation results in increased ACTH while gonadectomy is associated with increased gonadotropins. However, although there was a significant induction of corticotroph cell fate acquisition shortly after ablation, we unexpectedly observed increased differentiation toward all AL endocrine cell types. Nevertheless, in the longer term, lineage tracing experiments show that it is exclusively the targeted endocrine cell type that is maintained in the SC progeny. Therefore, following differentiation, selective maintenance of specific nascent cells is an important process regulating pituitary SC endocrine cell output, and it seems likely that this is controlled by the SC microenvironment. Selective fitness of surviving cells in the embryo relies on access to particular trophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In our Ax paradigm, the pituitary targets of the ablation, the corticotrophs, represent a likely source of signals. The multiple roles of the MET-HGF signalling pathway in survival, proliferation, cell migration and promotion of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) are certainly fitting with a trophic role of HGF secreting corticotrophs on MET positive SCs. Similarly, lactotrophs may be involved in the selective maintenance of nascent PRL cells emerging after tamoxifen treatment because prolactin secretion is increased by the SERM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In addition to the reliance on trophic factors, or maybe instead, it is likely that nascent cell maintenance involves integration into homotypic endocrine networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). This is reminiscent of what is known for nascent neurons that are often produced in excess and whose persistence relies on synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Although focusing on SCs enabled us to uncover novel regulators and unexpected modalities of the regenerative response, our analyses point toward an important role for the microenvironment, and in our multi-organ system, peripheric factors which are predicted to modulate the regenerative response. The thyroid (<italic>Thra</italic>) and the androgen (<italic>Ar</italic>) hormone receptors appear active in differentiating SCs, suggesting that they can respond to peripheral signals, and maybe integrate this information to regulate pituitary plasticity, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Further investigations of both local and peripheral interactions are now required to better understand how the regenerative response is regulated.</p><p id="P24">Differential clustering of SOX9iresGFP +ve SCs, trajectory analyses and <italic>in situ</italic> validation of new markers revealed the activity of region-specific regulatory pathways. We speculate that RA may be involved in AL SC differentiation, as shown in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The downregulation of ALDH1a2 expression in IL SCs which do not differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) provides an additional support to this hypothesis. In the trajectory analyses, the upstream expression pattern of <italic>Ednrb</italic> implies that the SCs lining the cleft are in a more immature state than those in the parenchyma, which fits with this epithelium constituting the primary pituitary SC niche. Among the 3 endothelin ligands, <italic>Edn3</italic> is the most abundantly expressed in the gland, more precisely in SCs and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This suggests that this pathway could function in an autocrine or paracrine way in cleft SCs, because these are not in close contact with capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), which would make an interaction with the latter unlikely. EDNRB signalling has been shown to regulate melanocyte SC regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and we are currently investigating whether this role is conserved in pituitary SCs. The presence of RUNX, IFR and STAT regulons during cell differentiation is also of potential interest because of the roles of these factors in different SC contexts, and because they have been shown to interact (RUNX/STAT and IFR/STAT). STAT transcription factors are activated by different cytokines and growth factors, in particular IL6 whose role in the regenerative response of pituitary SCs was recently uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Our differentiation trajectories suggest the presence of a common root for all endocrine cell types, which only segregate as the terminal differentiation markers are upregulated in the nascent cells. This process is likely to be fast since cells still contain GFP expressed from <italic>Sox9iresGFP</italic>. It is now important to determine whether the same genes in this common root are associated with the different lineages and when specificity first appears. It is tempting to draw a parallel with embryonic pituitary progenitors, because these were similarly shown to all commit at the same stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Interestingly, it was proposed that intrinsic factors and cell communication within the developing pituitary underlie specific endocrine cell fate acquisition, which, in a different context and with different modalities and outcomes, is what we hypothesize is happening in our model.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, evaluation of single cell transcriptomic predictions with short and long-term lineage tracing experiments has proved a robust strategy revealing novel aspects of pituitary SC regenerative responses. In circumstances where an exceptional physiological need is perceived, nascent cells of the appropriate type are maintained. Understanding how the new cells can survive will help us to understand how SC input is controlled in the pituitary, but this could also be relevant in other tissues where SC activity appears largely superfluous. Finally, it is notoriously difficult to obtain mature cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> for use in regenerative medicine. Therefore, identifying trophic factors for nascent cells, which may be all that can be obtained for transplantation, appears necessary.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Mice</title><p id="P27">All animal experiments carried out were approved under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and under the project licences n. 80/2405 and PP8826065. <italic>Sox9<sup>iresGFP/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Sox9<sup>tm1Haak</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), <italic>Sox9<sup>iresCreERT2/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Sox9<sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Haak</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), <italic>Wnt1Cre</italic> (<italic>(no gene)<sup>tg(Wnt1-GAL4)11Rth</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and <italic>Rosa26<sup>ReYFP/ReYFP</sup></italic> (<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) mice were maintained on a C57Bl6 background.</p><p id="P28">For CreERT2 induction in <italic>Sox9<sup>iresCreERT2/+</sup></italic> ;Rosa26<sup>ReYFP/+</sup> animals, tamoxifen was administered for 3 consecutive days at a concentration of 0.2mg/g body weight.
