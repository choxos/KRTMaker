<italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Mutations in DNMT3B can cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies type 1 (ICF1) syndrome which is characterised by hypomethylated heterochromatin. However, in the genome, DNMT3B primarily localises to actively transcribing gene bodies through the interaction of its PWWP domain with the histone modification H3K36me3 and it is unclear how it is recruited to heterochromatin. Here we show that in DNMT3B knockout cells, loss of DNA methylation predominantly occurs in heterochromatic domains marked by H3K9me3. We also find that PWWP domain mutations which disrupt DNMT3B’s interaction with H3K36me3 result in striking increases of DNA methylation in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. Gains of methylation are also observed when the PWWP domain of DNMT3B is deleted. In contrast, we find that the ICF1 syndrome-causing PWWP mutation, S270P, does not result in hypermethylation of heterochromatin and destabilises the protein. We also show that removal of the N-terminus region of DNMT3B affects its recruitment to chromatin and ability to methylate H3K9me3 marked regions. Our results suggest that DNMT3B is recruited to H3K9me3 marked heterochromatin in a PWWP-independent manner and that this recruitment is facilitated by the protein’s N-terminus. More generally, we suggest that DNMT3B plays a role in DNA methylation homeostasis at heterochromatin, a process which is disrupted in ICF syndrome, cancer and aging.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic mark that occurs predominantly on the cytosines of CpG dinucleotides in mammals. The mammalian genome is heavily methylated with the exception of some regulatory elements, particularly CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Suzuki and Bird, 2008</xref>).

This developmentally established pattern is then largely maintained by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Goll and Bestor, 2005</xref>).

The ADD domain of DNMT3A interacts with unmodified H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Otani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) to allosterically activate the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Li et al., 2011</xref>). This antagonizes DNMT3A’s activity at H3K4me3-marked promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>).

Overall methylation levels were decreased to 96% and 86% of the levels observed in HCT116 wild-type cells by WGBS and mass spectrometry respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To determine which type of genomic region was most affected by loss of DNMT3B we performed ChIP-seq for the histone modifications: H3K4me3 (promoter-associated), H3K36me3 (gene-body associated) and H3K9me3 (constitutive heterochromatin associated) in HCT116 cells. We also profiled the facultative heterochromatin-associated histone mark H3K27me3 which is deposited by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>). We then correlated the levels of these histone modifications to changes in DNA methylation between HCT116 and DNMT3B KO cells in 2.5 kb windows across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>).

However, the correlations were much stronger with the constitutive H3K9me3 and facultative H3K27me3 heterochromatin modifications (Pearson correlations, R=-0.124 and -0.173 respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>) than with H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 (Pearson correlations, R=-0.053 and -0.030 respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Given previous observations that DNMT3B is recruited to H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>), we next examined gene bodies which are the primary locations marked by H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bannister et al., 2005</xref>). Despite the role of DNMT3B at H3K36me3, the correlation between DNMT3B KO DNA methylation loss and H3K36me3 levels in gene bodies was very low and non-significant (Pearson correlation, R=-0.003, p-value = 0.671, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We then further examined the relationship between DNMT3B loss and the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications. H3K9me3 marked broad genomic domains of reduced DNA methylation in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In support of this, we found that hidden Markov model defined H3K9me3 domains significantly overlapped with extended domains of overall reduced methylation termed partially methylated domains (PMDs) defined in our HCT116 WGBS (Jaccard=0.575, p=1.07x10<sup>-6</sup>, Fisher’s test). They also significantly overlapped heterochromatic regions resistant to nuclease digestion identified using Protect-seq in the same cells (Jaccard=0.623, p=2.11x10<sup>-30</sup>, Fisher’s test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Spracklin and Pradhan, 2020</xref>). HCT116 H3K9me3 domains lost significantly more methylation in DNMT3B KO cells than non-heterochromatic domains which were marked by neither H3K9me3 nor H3K27me3 (other domains, p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup> Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b and c</xref>). Although HCT116 H3K9me3 domains showed some enrichment for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d</xref>), facultative heterochromatic domains marked by H3K27me3 alone lost DNA methylation to a significantly lesser degree in DNMT3B KO cells than H3K9me3 domains (p &lt; 1.8x10<sup>-9</sup> Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This suggests that DNMT3B is more active in regions of constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 than in facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3.</p><p id="P16">To confirm that DNMT3B methylates DNA at H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin we expressed the major catalytically active DNMT3B isoform expressed in somatic cells, DNMT3B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Weisenberger et al., 2004</xref>), in DNMT3B KO cells to generate DNMT3B<sup>WT</sup> cells (DNMT3B2 is henceforth referred to as DNMT3B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1e</xref>, top). We then compared gains of DNA methylation to histone modification levels assayed by ChIP-seq from DNMT3B KO cells. H3K9me3 domains were also observed in DNMT3B KO cells, and we defined them using a hidden Markov model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). DNMT3B KO H3K9me3 domains significantly overlapped HCT116 H3K9me3 domains (Jaccard=0.582, p=9.82x10<sup>-162</sup>, Fisher’s exact test) but showed a greater enrichment of H3K27me3 than HCT116 H3K9me3 domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d and f</xref>). Changes in DNA methylation in DNMT3B<sup>WT</sup> cells significantly correlated with H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 (Pearson correlations, R=0.306 and 0.230 respectively, both p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>) and more weakly with H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 (Pearson correlations, R=0.027 and 0.143 respectively, both p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>). In DNMT3B<sup>WT</sup> cells, gains of DNA methylation at DNMT3B KO H3K9me3 domains were significantly greater than those in domains defined by H3K27me3 alone or lacking either mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>), consistent with greater DNMT3B activity at H3K9me3 than H3K27me3 marked heterochromatin.

To impair the key H3K36me3 binding function of DNMT3B’s PWWP we therefore mutated a key residue of its aromatic cage, tryptophan 263 to alanine (W263A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and expressed this protein in DNMT3B KO cells (DNMT3B<sup>W263A</sup> cells).

In this system GFP intensity reports DNMT3B levels and transfection efficiency is reported by dsRed intensity.
