However, inconsistent findings were observed across very limited population-based studies. Herein we initiated a study using LNP carrier of Comirnaty<sup>®</sup> as a representative, and simulated real-world clinical practice covering a series of time points and various doses correlated with approved LNP-delivered drugs in a rat model. We demonstrated the time- and dose-dependency of LNP-induced anti-PEG antibodies in rats. As a thymus-independent antigen, LNP unexpectedly induced isotype switch and immune memory, leading to rapid enhancement and longer lasting time of anti-PEG IgM and IgG upon re-injection in rats. Importantly, initial LNP injection accelerated the blood clearance of subsequent dosing in rats. These findings refine our understandings on LNP and possibly other PEG derivatives, and may promote optimization of related premarket guidelines and clinical protocols.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) composed of ionizable cationic lipid, cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated lipid, have attracted great attention due to unique advantages such as simple formulation, good biocompatibility and large payload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Currently three LNP-delivered drugs have been marketed, including Patisiran (Onpattro<sup>®</sup>), mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (Comirnaty<sup>®</sup>) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax<sup>®</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Modification of therapeutics with PEG has shown a number of advantages in several aspects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed, as the first vaccine using PEG as an excipient, its PEG-conjugated lipid composition (ALC-0159) plays critical roles in improving the stability and blood circulation of LNP, leading to the overwhelming success of Comirnaty<sup>®</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Although free PEG is poorly immunogenic, it has been recognized as a polyvalent hapten and may acquire immunogenic properties, <italic>e.g</italic>. inducing anti-PEG antibodies, upon conjugation with other materials such as proteins and nanocarriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, anti-PEG antibodies could form "antigen-antibody" complexes with newly administered PEGylated drugs, while subsequent clearance of these complexes by macrophage may lead to biodistribution/pharmacokinetic changes and reduced efficacy of PEGylated drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, "antigen-antibody" complexes may induce severe side effects including hypersensitivity reactions, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a proportion of individuals who never received PEGylated drugs have anti-PEG antibodies possibly due to environmental exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">With the large-scale vaccination of mRNA vaccines, elucidating the potential PEG-associated immune responses triggered by clinically relevant LNP has become urgent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Currently, there is no consistent conclusion regarding any characteristic of initial and/or repeated injection of mRNA vaccines in inducing PEG-specific antibodies. Moreover, the amount of mPEG<sub>2000</sub> contained in each injection varies significantly among three approved LNP-delivered drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">For example, mPEG<sub>2000</sub> contained in each Onpattro<sup>®</sup> injection is as high as 262 times of Comirnaty<sup>®</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, raising our concern on the potential impact of mPEG<sub>2000</sub> exposure amount on induction of PEG-associated immune responses. Furthermore, as the first two vaccines using LNP as carriers, the pharmacokinetics of Comirnaty<sup>®</sup> and Spikevax<sup>®</sup> might differ from previously approved intramuscular vaccines, considering that the <italic>in vivo</italic> procedures of mRNA vaccines are mainly determined by their LNP carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

Through simulating the clinical practice of Comirnaty<sup>®</sup>, including two intramuscular injections with a 21-day interval, and delicately designing clinically relevant doses covering the whole range of mPEG<sub>2000</sub> amount contained in a single injection of approved LNP-delivered drugs, the PEG-associated immune responses triggered by LNP including potential impact on pharmacokinetic changes were carefully investigated.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Synthesis and physiochemical characterization of PEGylated LNP, DiR-LNP and DiR-LU@LNP</title><p id="P6">LNP, DiR-LNP (LNP labeled with DiR) and DiR-LU@LNP (LNP loaded with firefly luciferase mRNA and labeled with DiR) were prepared by mixing the ethanol phase containing ALC-0315, DSPC, cholesterol and ALC-0159 (with or without DiR) and the aqueous phase containing citrate buffer (with or without firefly luciferase mRNA) through a microfluidic mixing device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-1c</xref>). When examined with Cryo-TEM, LNP and DiR-LNP were characterized as hollow spheres, while DiR-LU@LNP exhibited a typical electron-dense core structure containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Further characterization with DLS showed that the Z-average/PDI/Zeta potential of LNP, DiR-LNP and DiR-LU@LNP were 110.400 ± 3.466 nm/0.203 ± 0.012/16.733 ± 0.451 mV, 113.067 ± 2.139 nm/0.183 ± 0.013/7.257 ± 0.168 mV and 101.367 ± 2.593 nm/0.197 ± 0.015/-5.943 ± 0.129 mV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d and 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These data demonstrate that three LNP formulations have optimal particle diameter, highly monodisperse particle-size distribution and weak surface charge. Additional evaluation in the presence of 10% rat serum mimicking blood circulation showed that LNP, DiR-LNP and DiR-LU@LNP have relatively stable particle sizes and stay monodisperse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-1c; Supplementary Figs. 2-4</xref>). Moreover, standard curves of phospholipid (DSPC) contained in three LNP formulations were respectively drawn, as the phospholipid component is commonly used for quantifying the whole LNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Subsequently, clinically relevant doses of LNP including low dose (L-LNP, 0.009 mg phospholipids/kg), middle dose (M-LNP, 0.342 mg phospholipids/kg) and high dose (H-LNP, 2.358 mg phospholipids/kg) were calculated based on the corresponding equations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d-f</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Time- and dose-dependent induction of anti-PEG IgM by PEGylated LNP</title><p id="P7">After intramuscular injection of LNP at above-mentioned three doses on Day 0 and Day 21, rat serum samples were respectively collected at 12 designated time points between Day 0 and Day 49, and examined for the presence and level of anti-PEG IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Our data showed that serum anti-PEG IgM was initially detected in L-LNP group on Day 3. Although anti-PEG IgM was undetectable until Day 5 in M-LNP and H-LNP groups, both doses induced significantly higher levels of anti-PEG IgM than that induced by L-LNP. Moreover, L-LNP induced anti-PEG IgM only detectable on Day 3 and Day 5 during the first injection cycle (Day 0~21), while M-LNP and H-LNP induced more persistent and higher levels of anti-PEG IgM detectable throughout Day 5~21, suggesting a time- and dose-dependent induction of anti-PEG IgM after an initial injection of LNP. Impressively, anti-PEG IgM was detected at more time points for all three doses after repeated injection compared with that during the first injection cycle. Particularly, M-LNP and H-LNP constantly induced anti-PEG IgM throughout the whole second injection cycle and extension period (Day 21~49). Meanwhile, anti-PEG IgM levels induced by three doses exhibited a consistent ranking (H-LNP &gt; M-LNP &gt; L-LNP) at nearly all detectable time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, the intra-assay precision/Coefficient of Variation (CV%) of anti-PEG IgM standards and serum samples were 3.884 ± 3.046% and 5.237 ± 6.192%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and the inter-assay precision/Coefficient of Variation (CV%) of anti-PEG IgM standards and goodness of fit/coefficient of determination (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>) of the standard curve were 20.983 ± 15.511% and 0.992 ± 0.004, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).

Moreover, consistent with the longer lasting period and higher level of anti-PEG IgM induced by repeated LNP injection, LMM analysis revealed the significant difference on antibody level between two separate injections (β for “Second Injection”: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 <italic>vs</italic> First Injection).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Time- and dose-dependent induction of anti-PEG IgG by PEGylated LNP</title><p id="P9">Serum samples collected at above-mentioned time points were further examined for anti-PEG IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, different from anti-PEG IgM production, no anti-PEG IgG was detected throughout the first injection cycle in all experimental groups. These data suggest that an initial single injection of LNP, at a broad range of doses, could not induce anti-PEG IgG in rats. However, although anti-PEG IgG was still undetectable after the second L-LNP injection, it was clearly induced by the repeated injection of M-LNP and H-LNP, and persisted at all later time points (Day 24~49). Similar to the dose-dependency of anti-PEG IgM, anti-PEG IgG levels induced by H-LNP were significantly higher than corresponding levels induced by M-LNP at all detectable time points, with peak levels achieved on Day 26 for both M-LNP and H-LNP groups. Moreover, the intra-assay precision/Coefficient of Variation (CV%) of anti-PEG IgG standards and serum samples were 4.897 ± 5.549% and 8.546 ± 12.211%, respectively, and the inter-assay precision/Coefficient of Variation (CV%) of anti-PEG IgG standards and goodness of fit/coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) were 24.896 ± 10.071% and 0.999 ± 0.001, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), all of which demonstrating the good quality control of ELISA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> for acceptance criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P10">As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, Control and L-LNP groups had similar time-course profile in anti-PEG IgG production (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 in profile analysis), whereas every other two groups exhibited different profiles (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 in profile analysis).

Another concern is additional exposure to PEG derivatives other than LNP possibly existed during clinical observation period. In agreement with this, Ju <italic>et al</italic> reported that unvaccinated control donors had increased level of anti-PEG IgG and/or anti-PEG IgM in their clinical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Together with other above-mentioned influence factors existed in clinical studies such as small population size and varied mPEG<sub>2000</sub> exposure amount, these limitations have led to inconsistent data regarding the characteristic of initial and repeated exposure to LNP-delivered drugs in inducing anti-PEG antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Motivated by these challenges, we initiated the first animal study using a model LNP with the largest number of recipients all over the world, and delicately simulated clinical practice for both schedule and doses. Anti-PEG antibody was undetectable in all experimental groups before initial LNP injection, demonstrating a “clean” background of our model system. Encouragingly, through designing a series of time points and three doses (1:38:262) correlated with the amount of mPEG<sub>2000</sub> contained in approved LNP-delivered drugs, we demonstrated for the first time that induction of anti-PEG IgM and IgG were both time- and dose-dependent, which are valuable for LNP-based research and development.</p><p id="P16">In spite of the significant difference between mRNA vaccines from traditional vaccines, no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted for either approved mRNA vaccines or their LNP carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Herein, we conducted the first pharmacokinetic study related with LNP-delivered vaccines or their LNP carriers. Our data suggest that previous LNP injection may accelerate the blood clearance of subsequently administered LNP, which has raised an important and clinically relevant issue that would warrant further investigation. It is noteworthy that although Alnylam Pharmaceuticals <italic>Inc</italic>. reported the absence of ABC phenomenon after repeated injection of Onpattro<sup>®</sup>, all patients in their study received corticosteroid premedication prior to each Onpattro<sup>®</sup> injection to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, corticosteroid is generally considered as an immunosuppressive drug and may repress PEG-associated immunological effects. To the best of our knowledge, previously there is no report investigating whether intramuscularly injected PEGylated therapeutics could induce accelerated blood clearance. Our data would thereby provide valuable information for revealing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of intramuscularly administered PEGylated therapeutics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Together with further in-depth studies using larger sample size, our findings may promote the optimization of premarket requirements and clinical practice for LNP-delivered biomedical products, as well as PEGylated products administered intramuscularly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Similar to PEGylated liposome, LNP belongs to thymus-independent antigens (TI-Ag) as it contains no proteinatious composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. There is a traditional perception that TI-Ag could not induce isotype switch from IgM to long-lasting IgG, resulting in IgM production only after TI-Ag administration, with no or very low level of IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, different from thymus-dependent antigens (TD-Ag), TI-Ag generally could not induce B cell memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. That is, an amplified, accelerated and affinity-matured antibody production could be observed after successive exposure to TD-Ag but not TI-Ag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with these theories, even six repeated injections of PEGylated liposome neither enhanced anti-PEG IgM production nor effectively induced anti-PEG IgG in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, we discovered that LNP not only induced isotype switch and production of anti-PEG IgG, but caused B cell memory, leading to rapid enhancement and longer lasting time of both anti-PEG IgM and IgG upon repeated injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). To our best knowledge, there is no previous report on either inducing B cell memory or isotype switching from IgM to IgG by any PEGylated TI-Ag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). These findings refine our understandings on PEGylated LNP, and possible other PEG derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p id="P18">Cholesterol (Cat.

Nanoparticles were either added into PBS (pH7.4) for Z-average and PDI measurements, or added into ultrapure water for determination of zeta potential. Three independent experiments were conducted, with each type of LNP examined at 25 ℃ for 10 seconds (pre-equilibration for 2 minutes) and repeated at least 10 times in disposable cuvettes (for Z-average and PDI) or zeta cuvettes (for zeta potential).
