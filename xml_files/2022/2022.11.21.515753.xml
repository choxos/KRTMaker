However, it remains unclear how CNAs contribute to embryonic tumourigenesis due to a lack of suitable models. Here we employ female human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation and single-cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis to assess the effects of chromosome 17q/1q gains, which are prevalent in the embryonal tumour neuroblastoma (NB). We show that CNAs impair the specification of trunk neural crest (NC) cells and their sympathoadrenal derivatives, the putative cells-of-origin of NB. This effect is exacerbated upon overexpression of <italic>MYCN</italic>, whose amplification co-occurs with CNAs in NB. Moreover, CNAs potentiate the pro-tumourigenic effects of <italic>MYCN</italic> and mutant NC cells resemble NB cells in tumours. These changes correlate with a stepwise aberration of developmental transcription factor networks. Together, our results sketch a mechanistic framework for the CNA-driven initiation of embryonal tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>copy number alterations</kwd><kwd>tumourigenesis</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P6">Cancers in early childhood are driven by sparse genetic aberrations arising <italic>in utero</italic>, which are thought to lead to defective differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Most tumours harbour large genomic rearrangements and chromosomal copy number alterations (CNA), which co-occur with mutations in tumour suppressors or tumourigenic transcription factors (TF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The mechanistic interactions between different mutations and early developmental processes are likely foundational drivers of tumour heterogeneity. However, since visible tumours are only detected long after their initiation, early mutation-driven interactions leading to the healthy-to-tumour transition have remained largely intractable.</p><p id="P7">Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in infants and an archetypal “developmental cancer”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

CNAs such as gains of the long arms of chromosomes 17 (chr17q) and 1 (chr1q) have been identified in the majority (up to 65%) of NB tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and their emergence is considered an early tumourigenesis “priming” event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

However, despite our advanced understanding of the genetic and developmental origin of NB, it remains unclear to date how CNAs disrupt embryonic cell differentiation and lead to NB initiation.</p><p id="P8">Here, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based model to experimentally dissect the links between NB-associated CNAs, <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, and tumour initiation. We interrogated the stepwise specification of trunk NC and sympathoadrenal lineages using directed differentiation of isogenic hESC lines with chr17q/1q gains and inducible <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression.

Combining CNAs with <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression completely disrupted normal NC differentiation; (ii) Mutant NC cells acquired tumourigenic hallmarks <italic>in vitro</italic>, the capacity to form tumours in xenografts, and resemble distinct subpopulations of heterogeneous NB tumours; (iii) An extensive re-wiring of chromatin connects the observed transcriptional and functional aberrations with a dysregulated network of developmental TFs. Collectively, our data put forward a CNA-driven distortion of trunk NC and sympathoadrenal differentiation as a priming mechanism for subsequent MYCN-induced tumour initiation.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells recapitulates key stages of trunk NC and sympathoadrenal development</title><p id="P9">To model the initiation stage and cell types relevant to NB tumourigenesis, we turned to an <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling approach. We have previously described an efficient strategy to produce human trunk NC, sympathoadrenal progenitors, and sympathetic neurons from hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our protocol involves treatment with defined cocktails of signalling pathway agonists/antagonists that induce neuromesodermal-potent axial progenitors (NMPs) at day 3 of differentiation (D3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and subsequently steer NMPs toward trunk NC cells (D9) and their sympathoadrenal derivatives (&gt;D14). At D19, the protocol yields catecholamine-producing sympathetic neurons marked by peripherin-expressing axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">As a prerequisite for studying the effects of CNAs on trunk NC differentiation, we first needed to define a molecular roadmap of normal hESC differentiation as a control. Therefore, we employed our protocol for the differentiation of karyotypically normal hESCs (H7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>; 46XX) and performed droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at key differentiation stages (D0 ≈ hESCs, D3 ≈ NMPs, D9 ≈ trunk NC, D14 ≈ sympathoadrenal progenitors, D19 ≈ early sympathetic neuron) and intermediate/late time points (D4, D10, D12, D28) to examine the resulting cell populations (up to five replicates each; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We obtained 29,857 cells that passed quality control, which we allocated to 14 distinct clusters (C1-C14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 2a-g</xref>). We bioinformatically annotated these cell clusters using two complementary approaches: (i) by identifying characteristic marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and (ii) by mapping our data to single-cell transcriptomes of trunk NC derivatives in human embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 2i,j</xref>). This strategy identified cells at different stages of trunk NC development, including NMP-like cells (marked by CDX1/2, NKX1-2, and FGF signalling-associated transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>; cluster C2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and later cell populations of a predominantly trunk axial identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>) exhibiting characteristics of Schwann cell precursors (SCP), sympathoblasts (SYM), as well as mesenchymal features (MES). For example, D9 cells split into subpopulations expressing markers of trunk NC/early SCPs (C3; e.g., <italic>SOX10</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; weak SCP-like signature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) and sensory neurons (C5; <italic>ONECUTF1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; weak SYM-like signature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). At D14, cells started to assume a sympathoadrenal/autonomic progenitor (C8; <italic>ASCL1)</italic> or mesenchymal (C11; <italic>FN1)</italic> identity, and by day D19, we observed three distinct fractions: mature SCP-like cells (C9; <italic>POSTN</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>; strong SCP signature), autonomic sympathoblasts (C12-C14; <italic>PHOX2A/B, ELAVL4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>; strong SYM signature), and MES-like cells (C11; <italic>COL1A1, FN1).</italic> This is in line with findings showing that trunk NC and SCPs are competent to generate mesenchyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we also found cells at the intersection of MES and SYM identity, as observed in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and NB cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). After 4 weeks (D28), we also observed some cells with a partial chromaffin-like cell identity (part of C14; <italic>CHGA</italic><sup>+</sup>, PMNT<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Together, these data confirm that our hESC-based model successfully captures trunk NC and sympathoadrenal cells as found in embryos during the onset of NB tumourigenesis. Moreover, they reveal two major developmental branching events: (i) an early commitment of trunk NC toward a sensory neuron fate; (ii) the late generation of multipotent SCP/sympathoadrenal progenitors, which subsequently give rise to three distinct cell types: mature SCPs, MES, and SYM.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>CNAs and <italic>MYCN</italic> cumulatively disrupt human trunk NC differentiation</title><p id="P12">Having established a reliable model of trunk NC lineages relevant for NB pathogenesis, we next asked how chr17q and chr1q gains and their interplay with <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression, which often co-occurs with CNAs in NB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, influence NC development. To this end, we employed two clonal isogenic hESC lines with NB-associated CNAs that were acquired by H7 hESCs (‘WT’; used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) as a result of culture adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>): (i) a gain of chromosome arm 17q11-qter (‘17q’)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and (ii) an additional gain of chr1q in the 17q background (‘17q1q’). Whole-exome sequencing of 17q and 17q1q cells compared to the parental H7 hESCs revealed a small number of additional mutations and a loss of a small region in chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</xref>). For brevity, we labelled the cell lines by their major CNAs, which overlap regions commonly gained in NB tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). 17q1q hESCs were engineered to include a Doxycycline (DOX)-inducible <italic>MYCN</italic> expression cassette to mimic <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification in a temporally controlled manner (‘17q1qMYCN’). DOX treatment of 17q1qMYCN resulted in robust induction of MYCN, similar to expression levels in MYCN-amplified tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 4d-f</xref>). In our experiments, we induced <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression at D5 (when cells adopt a definitive NC identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>) to avoid bias toward central nervous system differentiation, as seen upon <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression in earlier pre-NC progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Equipped with these three isogenic ‘mutant’ hESC lines, we performed differentiation toward trunk NC and carried out scRNA-seq as described above, yielding a combined dataset comprising 95,766 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To assess how differentiation was affected in each mutant cell line, we first focused on stages D9, D14, and D19 for which we had data from all four experimental conditions, and bioinformatically mapped the transcriptomes of mutant cells to our reference of normal trunk NC differentiation (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). While many 17q cells intertwined with all WT cell types (~98% matching the cognate WT stage), fewer 17q1q and 17q1qMYCN cells advanced beyond WT D14 (only ~48% and 22% matched with WT, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Only ~4% of 17q1qMYCN cells mapped to mature cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Altogether, at this level of resolution, we found no evidence that 17q affected differentiation. In contrast, 17q1q and 17q1qMYCN cells matched WT cells of earlier developmental stages, suggesting impaired differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we tested whether the cell types induced from mutant hESCs still truthfully recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic> cell types as seen for WT. Mapping mutant cells onto the same human embryonic adrenal gland reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> identified proportionally fewer SYM- and MES-like cells in 17q1q and 17q1qMYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2d,e</xref>). For cells mapped to the respective cell types, we observed a slightly stronger SCP signature in 17q and 17q1q, while the expression of both MES and SYM genes was weaker relative to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In 17q1qMYCN, the expression of all signatures was weak, suggesting a failure to fully specify the expected cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2d-g</xref>). Consistently, antibody staining for SOX10 and HOXC9 and flow cytometry revealed depletion of SOX10+ trunk NC cells in 17q1qMYCN cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The reduced ability of 17q1qMYCN hESCs to differentiate toward trunk NC derivatives was also reflected by their failure to generate PERIPHERIN-positive neuronal axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>). A similar, albeit milder effect was observed upon DOX-induced <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4h</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Differential analysis identified 941 (17q vs. WT), 2,039 (17q1q vs. WT), and 5,915 (17q1qMYCN vs. WT) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at D9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). As expected, many upregulated genes were located within the known CNAs (41.4% within chr17q for 17q cells; 18.7% within chr17q and 25.6% within chr1q for 17q1q cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).

These perturbed pathways may contribute to deregulation of expression of genes outside CNAs (e.g., upregulation of MYC targets and oxidative phosphorylation, and downregulation of G2-M checkpoint-related genes in 17q1qMYCN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To better resolve the molecular impact of each mutation, we integrated all datasets into a joint projection of WT and aberrant trunk NC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 6b-h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). The strongest changes were found in 17q1qMYCN, which formed disconnected cell clusters not normally produced in our protocol. To delineate the stepwise alteration of transcriptional programmes, we placed cells from D9 on a spectrum from WT to 17q1qMYCN by scoring each cell between 0 and 1 based on the fraction of mutant cells among its gene expression neighbours (“mutation score”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This allowed us to identify four sets of genes (D9_1–D9_4) that were correlated with mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 7a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>): Gain of CNAs led to a decrease in expression of genes (gene set D9_3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. <italic>3</italic>f</xref>) involved in NC development (e.g., <italic>TFAP2B</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>) and gradual induction of genes (D9_4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) associated with NC/NB cell migration (e.g.. <italic>ZIC2, HOXD3, GPC3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>). <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression in 17q1qMYCN further repressed genes related to NC development (D9_2; e.g., WNT-antagonist <italic>SFRP1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and nuclear receptors <italic>NR2F1/2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>) and led to upregulation of MYCN targets implicated in NB (D9_1; e.g., <italic>NME1</italic> on 17q<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).

Moreover, we found that many of genes that are upregulated in 17q1qMYCN (D9_1) were also highly expressed in NB tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We further sought to disentangle the relative contributions of <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression and CNAs to the observed differentiation block phenotype in 17q1q cells. To this end, we generated additional cell lines derived from WT and 17q H7 hESCs by equipping each with a DOX-inducible <italic>MYCN</italic> construct (WTMYCN, 17qMYCN; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Moreover, we introduced the same inducible <italic>MYCN</italic> expression cassette into a second female hESC cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (H9) which had independently acquired chr17q and 1q gains (H9-WT, H9-17q1q, H9-17q1qMYCN). The differentiation trajectories of these cell lines in the presence and absence of <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression were interrogated using split-pool single-cell RNA-seq. To ensure consistency, we also included the previously analysed H7 cell lines (WT, 17q, 17q1q, 17q1qMYCN) and performed 2-4 replicate experiments. We obtained a total of 45,546 cells (all D9) post-QC and mapped each dataset onto our WT reference, as we had done before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). Starting with gain of chr17q, we found a reduction in cells allocated to sensory neuronal differentiation (cluster C4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b,c</xref>) and instead a slight increase in a transitional progeny (C7). With chr1q, we also saw an increase of cells in C10. On top of these changes, <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression led to most cells allocating to earlier developmental stages including clusters C2 and C3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 8b,c</xref>) – reflecting the differentiation block we had observed before (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2b,c</xref>). The observed changes were consistent for derivatives of both parental hESC lines (H7 and H9). Analysis of marker gene expression associated with the altered cell clusters (C2, C4, C7, C10) in the different mutant cell lines identified an upregulation of genes like <italic>AZIN1</italic> in all <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpressing cells that was not active in their wild-type or CNA-only counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>). Conversely, these cells downregulated developmental regulators. For instance, even though MYCN-overexpressing cells still expressed remnant gene signatures leading them to map to differentiating WT cell clusters they downregulated genes in developmental pathways like <italic>HHIP</italic> in cluster C7 or <italic>WNT1</italic> in C10. Moreover, the neurogenic capacity of the mutant trunk NC cells (as reflected by the presence of PERIPHERIN-positive neuronal axons) was found to be disrupted by <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression primarily in the presence of CNAs, with the strongest phenotype being observed in the presence of both chr17q and chr1q gains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>), in line with our earlier findings.

As this phenomenon is reminiscent of loss of contact inhibition, a cancer hallmark, we next examined whether <italic>CNAs/MYCN</italic> overexpression led to further cellular changes that are typical of tumourigenesis. We first carried out cell cycle analysis of trunk NC cells (D9) generated from each <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpressing hESC line (from WT/17q/17q1q backgrounds) by monitoring EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) incorporation via flow cytometry. We found a significant increase in the proportion of cells in S-phase only when <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression was combined with CNAs (p = 0.0233 and p = 0.0073 respectively; two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) indicating altered cell cycle and increased replication similar to NB tumours and cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki-67 expression further showed that 17q1qMYCN and 17qMYCN cultures exhibited a higher proliferation rate by D14 compared to their CNA-only counterparts (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0078, respectively; two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). We next tested how <italic>CNAs/MYCN</italic> influenced colony formation, another hallmark of tumourigenesis. Low-density plating of trunk NC cells (D9) and image analysis showed significantly increased clonogenicity (p = 0.0109; two-way ANOVA) exclusively in 17q1qMYCN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). DOX treatment of the unedited parental wild type and chr17q gain cell lines had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Previous work has indicated that <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression alone is associated with increased apoptosis in early sympathoadrenal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> and can trigger tumourigenesis only in combination with additional mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Therefore, we also examined apoptosis levels during the transition of D9 trunk NC cells toward the SCP/sympathoblast stage (D14) by assessing cleaved Caspase-3 levels using flow cytometry. We found that <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression indeed resulted in a higher rate of apoptosis in the WT background, while this increase was reversed in 17q cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). However, this was not the case in cultures derived from <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpressing cells with chr17q1q gains, which exhibited apoptosis levels similar to their <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpressing WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 9b,c</xref>). This phenomenon may be linked to the presence of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in chromosome arm chr1q (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) as well as increased DNA damage (assessed by the presence of γH2AX foci) following <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression specifically in the 17q1q background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 9d,e</xref>). Interestingly, we detected lower levels of DNA damage in the absence of MYCN overexpression in 17q and 17q1q trunk NC cells at D9 compared to WT controls suggesting a potential protective effect of 17q/1q gains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 9d</xref>). Moreover, we investigated whether <italic>MYCN</italic>-overexpressing cells from different backgrounds had acquired additional mutations during differentiation. Whole-exome sequencing analysis at D19 of differentiation did not reveal any new large CNAs and detected only few mutations (&lt;10 mutations with variant allele frequency &gt;0.2 between D0 and D19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). None of the discovered mutations have previously been reported in NB, leading us to conclude that the observed phenotypic changes in 17q1qMYCN were likely a product of the CNAs and <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression rather than an expansion of new clonal cell populations with additional pathognomonic mutations. Despite an increase of proliferation (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4b,c</xref>), <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression did not yield more high-frequency mutations during the short timeframe of our differentiation experiments, consistent with earlier work in human neuroepithelial stem cells in <italic>vitro</italic> and after xenotransplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> (p = 0.3458, two-sided, paired Wilcoxon test, n = 3 per group; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9g</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Finally, we sought to examine the tumourigenic potential of 17q1q-, 17q1qMYCN- and WT-derived trunk NC (D9 of differentiation) cells <italic>in vivo</italic> by xenografting them into immunodeficient NSG mice.

After 3-5 weeks with continuous DOX administration, all 17q1qMYCN-injected mice developed visible tumours at the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In contrast, neither WT-nor 17q1q-injected control animals displayed any signs of tumours for up to 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Likewise, orthotopic injection into the adrenal gland (n = 3 mice per condition) yielded tumour growths visible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 5 weeks only when <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression was induced by DOX in 17q1qMYCN-grafted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>).

Complementary to our analysis in mice, we also performed exploratory xenografts of the same cell lines in zebrafish larvae. To this end, we labelled our 17q1qMYCN and WT cells at D9 with a fluorescent dye (CellTrace Violet) and injected them into the perivitelline space of zebrafish larvae on day 2 post fertilisation. Consistent with our results in mice, we found that 17q1qMYCN cells survived longer in zebrafish than WT, which had diminished in number at day 1 post injection (dpi) and were completely absent at 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 10b,c</xref>). In contrast, 17q1qMYCN cells survived until 3 dpi, with 16% of larvae even showing an increase in xenotransplant size.

We observed apparent differences between studies and tumour types, but to date there is only a limited amount of single-cell data from NB tumours to robustly interpret such heterogeneity. We therefore sought to interrogate a large collection of bulk RNA-seq data from NB tumours (SEQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>).

To delineate chromatin changes in detail, we performed differential accessibility analysis between all differentiation stages per cell line and between all cell lines at matched stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 12, 13</xref>).

In total, there were 45,583 regions with differential accessibility in at least one comparison, which we divided into nine chromatin modules R1-R9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Modules R1-R7 reflect differentiation order, e.g., regions in module R1 were mostly accessible at D0, and R6 comprises regions accessible at D14 and D19. Most changes observed in mutant hESC-derivatives fell within these modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 12a,b</xref>). 17q1q and 17q1qMYCN cells failed to close chromatin that is usually specific to D9 (R4, R5) and conversely to open chromatin regions indicative of late sympathoadrenal differentiation (R6, R7; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>).

Next, we examined the identity of genes near the chromatin modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). For each module, we found enrichments of specific marker genes identified in our scRNA-seq analysis of WT trunk NC differentiation (i.e., clusters C1-C14 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b,c</xref>). For example, chromatin module R7 (accessible in late differentiation stages, lost in mutants) was linked to clusters C11/C12 (MES-like cells). Next, we examined TF binding motifs in each module to identify potential upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>).

Interestingly, R3 (accessible at NMP and NC stage) was accessible in most NB cell lines examined except in those with mesenchymal characteristics (SK-N-AS and SHEP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12g</xref>).

Conversely, the gene set D9_2 (expressed in WT/17q/17q1q) was enriched for targets of TFs expected at this stage of differentiation, e.g. SOX4/5/10, TFAP2A/B, and nuclear receptors NR2F1/2. The expression of targets of these TFs increased or decreased along the mutational spectrum, corroborating their association with the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>). While many TF targets switched expression rapidly with <italic>MYCN</italic> overexpression, others showed a continuous pattern with up-/down-regulation already detectable in 17q and 17q1q, e.g., targets of vagal and early NC regulators HOXB3 and CDX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> (up), or of sensory neurogenesis regulator NEUROD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (down).

These diagrams showcased the emergence of a new subnetwork of TFs in 17q1qMYCN that centred on MYCN and incorporated TFs like NR1D1 and TFAP4. In contrast, a subnetwork involving NC-related TFs such as SOX10 and TFAP2A/B was lost in these cells. Intriguingly, downregulation of TFs linked to sensory neuronal development (NEUROD1, ONECUT1) was visible already in 17q cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref>), perhaps explaining why sensory neuron-like derivatives were less abundant in 17q cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

While many of the TFs implicated in these developmental gene-regulatory networks are not or only weakly expressed in NB tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>), we found that the targets of MYCN-related TFs (based on our analysis) are highly expressed in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14b</xref>).

Intuitively, the mutation score of a cell indicates whether a cell phenotypically resembles wild-type cells or cells with a given number of relevant alterations independent of its own genotype.

To simplify plots, we only labelled TFs with positive mean scaled expression values (&gt;0.05) and manually aggregated many overlapping values, but all node labels are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables 1-16</label><media xlink:href="EMS157612-supplement-Supplementary_Tables_1_16.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d5aAdGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS157612-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAdGcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S63"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Biomedical Sequencing Facility at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences for assistance with next-generation sequencing, Bettina Brunner-Herglotz (CCRI) for her technical assistance, and Duncan Baker (Sheffield Diagnostic Genetic Services, Sheffield Children’s Hospital) for carrying out karyotyping of hESC lines.
