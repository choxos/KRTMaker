Using 6 pMHC-multimers in a cohort with early and frequent sampling we define the phenotype and kinetics of recalled and primary T cell responses following Delta or Omicron breakthrough infection. Recall of spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was rapid, with cellular proliferation and extensive activation evident as early as 1 day post-symptom onset. Similarly, spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were rapidly activated but showed variable levels of expansion. Strikingly, high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation at baseline and peak were strongly correlated with reduced peak SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in nasal swabs and accelerated clearance of virus. Our study demonstrates rapid and extensive recall of memory T cell populations occurs early after breakthrough infection and suggests that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the control of viral replication in breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">COVID-19 vaccines provide a degree of protection against acquisition of infection but robustly protect against severe disease in the event of vaccine breakthrough infection (BTI)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lauring et al., 2022</xref>), even in the face of antibody-evasive viral variants such as BA.1 and BA.2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buchan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kirsebom et al., 2022</xref>). Neutralising antibody titres in blood are well established as a correlate of protection from both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cromer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Khoury et al., 2021</xref>), with evidence for a mechanistic protective role supported by the clinical utility of monoclonal antibody treatments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Stadler et al., 2022</xref>).

In particular, it has been proposed that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory are important mediators of vaccine-associated protection from severe outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bertoletti et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scurr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wherry and Barouch, 2022</xref>). Interestingly, although unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts show similar peak viral load after infection, vaccinated individuals exhibit accelerated viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract (URT) beginning four to six days after symptom onset(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Garcia-Knight et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Puhach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Singanayagam et al., 2022</xref>). While the mechanisms of vaccine-associated viral decline are yet to be defined, a role is plausible for both CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may induce cytolysis or produce antiviral cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sekine et al., 2020</xref>) as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may support the recall of humoral immunity or potentially exert cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaneko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Meckiff et al., 2020</xref>). There is, however, a paucity of data directly linking CD8<sup>+</sup> and/or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recall to viral clearance in human SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p><p id="P3">Previous studies of BTI have demonstrated the recall of spike (S)-specific memory T cells established by prior immunisation, as well as the induction of primary T cell responses against non-vaccine encoded viral antigens such as nucleocapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Collier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kared et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Minervina et al., 2022</xref>). To have a meaningful impact on either the rate of viral clearance or the likelihood of progressing to severe disease, memory T cell responses must be efficiently activated, likely within the first few days, following BTI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bertoletti et al., 2022a</xref>). While cross-sectional studies of BTI cohorts have provided evidence for variable activation or expansion of S-specific T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Collier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kared <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), early longitudinal sampling in cohorts with well-defined exposure history is rare(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kedzierska and Thomas, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Koutsakos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Reinscheid et al., 2022</xref>). Additional work is therefore required to understand how quickly T cell activation, proliferation and effector function can occur relative to viral clearance.</p><p id="P4">In addition to the paucity of immunological studies that are temporally aligned with viral kinetics, determination of T cell activation and <italic>ex vivo</italic> phenotype requires direct detection of antigen-specific T cells without <italic>in vitro</italic> restimulation.

Further, we compare the kinetics of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall to the induction of a primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, a non-vaccine encoded viral antigen. These data define the relationship between viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and T cell activation, proliferation, and initiation of effector programs, shedding light on the dynamics of human adaptive immunity to respiratory virus infection in a highly vaccinated population.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Kinetics of viral clearance and antibody recall following SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections</title><p id="P5">To understand the kinetics of T cell recall in relation to viral clearance and humoral immunity, we recruited a cohort of 23 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection (BTI) with Delta (n= 6), Omicron BA.1 (n= 7) or Omicron BA.2 (n= 10) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S1). Frequent longitudinal nasal swabs and peripheral blood samples were obtained 0-14 days post-symptom onset (PSO) with additional follow-up blood samples obtained up to day 44 PSO.

Importantly, being based on the estimated kinetic parameters of viral load and T cell immunity this association does not simply reflect temporal relationships between an activated immune response and declining virus. Our findings are also consistent with animal studies in which CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion results in delayed viral clearance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). While data derived from peripheral blood may not necessarily reflect T cell responses in tissues, we find that activated S-specific T cells express chemokine receptors that should facilitate trafficking to inflamed tissues, as well as effector molecules such as GzmB that can lead to clearance of infected cells. It is important to note that we were unable to assess the role of T cell activation in the context of diverse clinical outcomes, which will need to be addressed in future studies. A key issue that remains poorly understood is whether or how accelerated viral clearance in the URT is related to protection from severe disease among vaccinated individuals. It is possible that immune responses contributing to viral clearance in the URT also prevent spread of virus to the lower respiratory tract and thus mitigate disease progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wherry and Barouch, 2022</xref>); in this context, both antibodies and cytolytic T cells could contribute to the containment of viral replication.</p><p id="P25">Parallel tracking of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses revealed the extent to which memory T cell pools can be reactivated following antigen exposure. In particular, the rapid appearance of highly activated S-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery (often within a 24 hour sampling window) demonstrated the remarkable efficiency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recall during BTI. Furthermore, long-term tracking of S-specific T cell populations through multiple vaccinations and infections demonstrated the ability of memory cells to be established and recalled multiple times over the course of one to two years with no evidence for progressive exhaustion or anergy. There may, however, be a ‘ceiling’ of epitope-specific T cell frequencies, such that repeated antigen exposure largely maintains a stable population of memory T cells rather than progressively increasing the memory pool with each restimulation.</p><p id="P26">Previous characterization of nucleoprotein- (B7-N<sub>105</sub>-) specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in pre-pandemic samples and uninfected individuals has indicated that the majority of these cells have a naïve phenotype(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nguyen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), which is further supported by our analysis. Thus, the analysis of Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in our S-vaccinated BTI cohort provides an opportunity to analyse both primary and recall CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses together. Intriguingly, we did not find any major differences in the kinetics of primary and recalled responses, consistent with a previous report on recalled Yellow Fever Virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Minervina et al., 2020</xref>). We do note that the high degree of variability for S-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall in this cohort could mask subtle kinetic differences between primary and recall responses.

Nevertheless, our data suggest that the protective benefit of circulating T cell memory may be more related to the maintenance of an expanded population of T cells with immediate effector function rather than accelerated activation or proliferation kinetics compared to a primary response. Given, however, that both the activation time and response peak time of primary N-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood occur early after symptom onset, it is plausible that both primary and recalled responses contribute to viral clearance.</p><p id="P27"><italic>In vitro</italic> restimulation assays have typically been employed to enumerate vaccine- or infection-elicited T cells prior to BTI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scurr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tan et al., 2021a</xref>).

A key consideration for future research will be to define how functional attributes of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, like cytokine production or cytolytic potential, compare to phenotypic activation during BTI, which may guide the selection of optimal readouts for monitoring T cell recall and correlates of protection in larger cohorts.</p><p id="P28">We and others have previously described how cTFH responses serve as correlates of humoral immunity during viral infection and vaccination, including for SARS-CoV-2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Juno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Koutsakos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Koutsakos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wragg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). The low frequency of S-specific cTFH cells in our BTI cohort was therefore intriguing.

Although our study is focused on 26 individuals, the thorough kinetic analyses of 150 nasal swabs and 138 blood samples may facilitate more targeted sampling of larger cohorts at key timepoints defined in our study. Analysis of more diverse cohorts may facilitate further dissection of factors affecting immune recall and viral clearance including previous antigen exposures, age or disease severity, which was not possible in our cohort. Nonetheless, our study provides considerable evidence that T cell activation occurs before detectable expansion in the number of cells, and is correlated with virological control during BTI with SARS-CoV-2.

The next day, Vero cells were washed once with 200 μl serum-free DMEM and added with 150μl of infection media (serum-free DMEM with 1.33 μg/ml TPCK trypsin). 2.5-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated plasma (1:20-1:12207) were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 virus at 2000 TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml at 37°C for 1 hour. Next, plasma-virus mixtures (50μl) were added to Vero cells in duplicate and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. ‘Cells only’ and ‘virus+cells’ controls were included to represent 0% and 100% infectivity respectively. After 48 hours, all cell culture media were carefully removed from wells and 200 μl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the cells for 30 mins at room temperature. The plates were then dunked in a 1% formaldehyde bath for 30 minutes to inactivate any residual virus prior to removal from the BSL3 facility. Cells were washed once in PBS and then permeabilized with 150μl of 0.1% Triton-X for 15 minutes. Following one wash in PBS, wells were blocked with 200μl of blocking solution (4% BSA with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour. After three washes in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), wells were incubated with 100μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV N antibody (Rockland, #200-401-A50) at a 1:8000 dilution in dilution buffer (PBS with 0.2% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA and 0.5% NP-40) for 1 hour. Plates were then washed six times in PBST and added with 100μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, #ab6721) at a 1:8000 dilution for 1 hour. After six washes in PBST, plates were developed with TMB and stopped with 0.15M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. OD values read at 450nm were then used to calculate %neutralization with the following formula: (‘Virus + cells’ – ‘sample’) ÷ (‘Virus + cells’ – ‘Cells only’) × 100. IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism with curve fits constrained to have a minimum of 0% and maximum of 100% neutralization.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay with viability dye readout</title><p id="P35">For Omicron breakthrough infections, plasma neutralization activity against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 was measured in HAT-24 cells using a viability dye readout.

Purified nucleic acid was then immediately converted to cDNA by reverse transcription with random hexamers using the SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bioline Reagents, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was used immediately in the rRT-PCR or stored at -20oC. Three microlitres of cDNA was added to a commercial real-time PCR master mix (PrecisionFast qPCR Master Mix; Primer Design, UK) in a 20 μL reaction mix containing primers and probe with a final concentration of 0.8μM and 0.1μM for each primer and the probe, respectively. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) genes using previously described primers and probes (Chan et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020). Thermal cycling and rRT-PCR analyses for all assays were performed on the ABI 7500 FAST real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) with the following thermal cycling profile: 95oC for 2 min, followed by 45 PCR cycles of 95oC for 5 s and 60oC for 30 s for N gene.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Modelling of viral and immune kinetics</title><p id="P37">We used a piecewise model to estimate the activation time and growth rate of various immune responses following breakthrough infections.
