The role of neurogenic pioneer factor ASCL1 in shaping chromatin landscape in human neurogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that ASCL1 acts as a pioneer transcription factor in a transient population of progenitors. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> ASCL1 knockout model we show it drives progenitor differentiation by cis-regulation both as a classical pioneer factor and as a non-pioneer remodeler, where ASCL1 binds permissive chromatin to induce chromatin conformation changes. We find ASCL1 directly interacts with mammalian BAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, essential for neurogenesis and involved in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. ASCL1 acts as a non-pioneer chromatin remodeler to regulate gene expression at a subset of loci, requiring mBAF SWI/SNF’s ATPase activity for cis-regulation of gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that ASCL1 is a key chromatin remodeler in human neurogenesis, uncovering an alternative mechanism of remodeling function dependent on partner ATPase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>iPSC-derived culture</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>ASCL1</kwd><kwd>mSWI/SNF</kwd><kwd>chromatin regulation</kwd><kwd>pioneer transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neuronal differentiation of stem and progenitor cells in the developing mammalian brain is a highly regulated process that results in the generation of neurons of distinct identities in appropriate numbers and at defined locations. A group of transcription factors (TFs) of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class, called proneural proteins have a prominent role in the regulation of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the proneural factor ASCL1 has been shown to regulate multiple steps of neurogenesis, including the proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of multipotent progenitors, and the differentiation and migration of postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Borromeo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Nieto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Pacary et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Tomita et al., 2000</xref>).

However, ASCL1 expression has also been reported in progenitor cells in the human embryonic telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alzu’bi and Clowry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it has retained a function in the regulation of neurogenesis in humans.</p><p id="P3">Some of the TFs regulating the differentiation of tissues in the embryo control early steps in the development of cell lineages via their pioneer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Mayran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Song et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Most TFs interact with their cognate binding sites in the genome only when in an open chromatin configuration, i.e. in a stretch of DNA that is not wrapped around nucleosomes. In contrast, pioneer transcription factors have the capacity to recognize binding sites in regulatory elements embedded in closed chromatin, i.e. in DNA wrapped around nucleosomes, and to open chromatin, thus facilitating the binding of other transcription factors and the transcription of the associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). A third category has recently been proposed, “non-classical” pioneer TFs, which remodel chromatin but have DNA binding properties constrained by nucleosome position, and require the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes to their target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Minderjahn et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Proneural proteins, including ASCL1, have been shown to display pioneer activity, recognizing nucleosomal DNA enriched for a short E-box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Henke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). Evidence for the pioneer activity of ASCL1 comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted nucleosome binding assays and studies involving overexpression of the protein in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aydin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Heinrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, ASCL1 has been shown to recognize its neuronal targets in a closed chromatin state when overexpressed in fibroblasts and thereby initiate neuronal reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, ASCL1 binds neuronal genes in a closed configuration when overexpressed in undifferentiated neural stem cells or glioblastoma stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>). However, ASCL1 function in human neurogenesis is currently unknown. Moreover, the pioneer activity of the endogenous ASCL1 protein has not yet been investigated, nor has the mechanism by which local chromatin structure is affected by ASCL1 binding. Different models have been proposed to explain the capacity of pioneer factors to open chromatin, including physical displacement of nucleosomes by the pioneer factor-DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), and/or interaction with other transcription factors and proteins with chromatin remodeling capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">King and Klose, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Takaku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Theodorou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Four families of chromatin remodeling factors have been identified in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Becker and Workman, 2013</xref>). Among them, the mammalian mSWI/SNF complexes represent attractive candidates to interact with ASCL1, because of their role in the regulation of neurogenesis, exemplified by their implication in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Kosho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Pulice and Kadoch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Sokpor et al., 2017</xref>). While core subunits of BAF complexes are ubiquitously expressed, other subunits are incorporated with developmental stage and cell-type specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Mashtalir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Son and Crabtree, 2014</xref>). Importantly, changes in the combinatorial assembly of BAF complexes underpin the transition from neural progenitors to neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Staahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>), with specific subunits incorporating in progenitor-specific (npBAF) or neuronal-specific (nBAF) complexes. The developmental overlap of npBAF and proneural transcription factors was recently highlighted by the demonstration that conditional deletion of npBAF subunit ACTL6A in mouse cortex leads to decreased chromatin accessibility at proneural TF binding sites, including ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Braun et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the pioneer TF ASCL1 may interact with mBAF SWI/SNF complexes to regulate chromatin accessibility at neurogenic loci to coordinate neurodifferentiation.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which ASCL1 regulates neurogenesis in a cell culture model of human cortical development. We show that ASCL1 expression defines a cell population of transitional neural progenitors immediately preceding differentiation to neurons. ASCL1 has pioneer activity, binding regulatory elements implicated in neurogenic programs in a closed chromatin configuration and opening chromatin at many of its target sites. It also binds sites with a low degree of accessibility to induce further chromatin changes. Cooperative mSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPase activity is required for ASCL1 activity at a subset of its targets. Together, our findings support a model whereby ASCL1 acts as a pioneer factor in distinct ways during human telencephalic neurogenesis. It acts as a classical pioneer transcription factor binding heterochromatin for regulation of a fraction of its targets, largely without mSWI/SNF interaction. However, it also regulates chromatin accessibility at a large number of loci in the genome via cooperative binding with the mSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers at sites of permissive DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ASCL1 is expressed in cells transitioning from dividing progenitors to postmitotic neurons during human cortical neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo</title><p id="P7">The function of ASCL1 as a pioneer transcription factor has been established by studying the reprogramming of somatic cells into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Wapinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), yet the role of endogenous ASCL1 in human cortical development remains unexplored. To investigate this, we modelled human cortical development <italic>in vitro</italic>, by using a two-dimensional (2D) adherent dual SMAD inhibition protocol to promote the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into cortical neurons (modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Shi et al., 2012</xref>)). We first characterized the expression of ASCL1 in this model system. We detected expression of <italic>ASCL1</italic> transcripts by qRT-PCR and expression of ASCL1 protein by western blotting at 17 days of differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), preceding the onset of expression of neuronal markers <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>HUC/D</italic> and <italic>CTIP2</italic> at days 18-20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Addition of g-secretase inhibitor DAPT at DIV23 accelerated and synchronized the cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Crawford and Roelink, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B,C</xref>). ASCL1 RNA and protein levels increased rapidly and peaked 24 hours after DAPT addition (DIV24), before declining and becoming undetectable after DIV30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Concomitant with the burst in ASCL1 expression at DIV23-24, neural progenitors exposed to DAPT showed a rapid decrease in expression of the cell proliferation marker <italic>MKi67</italic>, upregulation of cell cycle arrest genes <italic>CDKN1C</italic> and <italic>GADD45G</italic>, and strong upregulation of neuronal markers <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>HUC/D</italic> and <italic>CTIP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To further investigate the concomitance of ASCL1 expression with cell cycle exit, we dissected the heterogeneity of neural lineage cell states in iPSC-derived neural cultures by performing a single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis in DIV24 cultures treated with g-secretase inhibitor DAPT, using the 10X Genomics Chromium single cell platform. Unsupervised clustering of a dataset of 28,316 cells collected from 3 concurrent differentiated cultures resulted in 22 clusters of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). The clusters were then grouped based on their expression of predefined canonical markers of the progenitor state (<italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>HES5</italic>), proliferation (<italic>MKi67</italic>, <italic>MCM2</italic>), cell cycle exit (<italic>CDKN1C</italic>, <italic>GADD45G</italic>) and neuronal differentiation (<italic>HES6</italic>, <italic>SOX4</italic>, <italic>DCX</italic>, <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>ELAVL4</italic>, <italic>GAD2</italic>, <italic>SLC17A6</italic>). This resulted in 3 main cell clusters containing respectively cycling neural progenitors, neurons, and transitional progenitors bridging the two previous clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). The cluster defined as ‘transitional progenitors’ co-expressed markers of progenitors (<italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>NES</italic>), cell cycle exit (<italic>CDKN1C</italic>, <italic>GADD45G</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic>) and early neuronal differentiation (<italic>HES6</italic>, <italic>SOX4</italic>) with very low levels of proliferation markers (<italic>MKi67</italic> and <italic>MCM2</italic>) and of neuronal markers (<italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>NEFM</italic>, <italic>STNM2</italic>, <italic>STMN4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, this cluster represents progenitors transitioning between mitotic progenitors and differentiating neurons, i.e., likely preceding or just following the last progenitor cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis confirmed that the transitional progenitor cluster is uniquely enriched for <italic>ASCL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) and several of its previously reported transcriptional targets including <italic>SMOC1, RGS16</italic>, and <italic>IGFBP5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Martynoga et al., 2012</xref>), supporting that it is a <italic>bona fide</italic> cell state defined by ASCL1 expression, rather than a mixture of progenitors and neurons. To characterize the cell state transitions in our model of neural differentiation, we predicted directed dynamic transitions between clusters using RNA velocity analysis (with the scVelo tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>)). The estimated velocity vector streams delineate the direction of cell state transitions with cycling progenitor cells at the apex and a trajectory towards transitional progenitors followed by postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Further trajectory inference using PAGA (Partition-based graph abstraction) was employed to estimate connectivity and transition between groups of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), which complemented by RNA velocity information supported the directionality of the transitions between cell states. Together, our scRNA-Seq analysis shows that during human neurogenesis, an increase in ASCL1 expression specifically marks a transient population of progenitors differentiating into neurons.</p><p id="P9">We next sought to further characterize this unique cluster of ASCL1-expressing progenitors identified by scRNAseq, by investigating co-expression of ASCL1 protein with canonical markers of cell identity. Using immunolabelling of DIV24 cultures, we found that ASCL1 was expressed in the granular ‘salt-and-pepper’ pattern characteristic of proneural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kageyama et al., 2008</xref>). While all ASCL1-positive cells co-expressed the neural progenitor marker PAX6, none co-expressed the deep layer cortical neuronal marker CTIP2, confirming that ASCL1 is expressed by a subset of progenitor cells and not by differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated DIV24 cultures confirmed this, as shown by the co-expression of ASCL1 with the progenitor marker SOX2 but not with the neuronal marker TUBB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, ASCL1 immunolabeling signal was highest in cells bridging progenitors (low TUBB3, high SOX2) and neurons (high TUBB3, low SOX2), suggesting that ASCL1 protein is expressed at its highest levels before the reduction of SOX2 expression and the onset of TUBB3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), similar to the <italic>ASCL1</italic> transcripts’ distribution in transitional progenitors in the scRNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of nuclear DNA content by DAPI staining to infer cell cycle stage, showed a significantly lower proportion of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle in ASCL1-high compared to ASCL1-low progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). This was accompanied by greater proportions of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases in the ASCL1-high population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that a high proportion of cells from the ASCL1-high population progress through their last division and exit the cell cycle, presumably before differentiating into neurons.</p><p id="P10">To confirm the relevance of these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated ASCL1 expression in the developing human cortex using human fetal brain tissue at post-conceptional week 16 (PCW 16). Immunolabeling of human fetal brain slices for ASCL1 and PAX6 or CTIP2 showed that during human cortical development, ASCL1 expression is also restricted to PAX6-positive progenitors and excluded from postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alzu’bi and Clowry, 2019</xref>), and corroborating the findings in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model system of human neurodifferentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ASCL1 drives the differentiation of cycling progenitors into postmitotic neurons by directly regulating hundreds of genes</title><p id="P11">Having defined a unique ASCL1-expressing progenitor population consistent with cells exiting the cell cycle, we sought to investigate the role of ASCL1 in that transition. To that end, we generated <italic>ASCL1</italic> knockout (<italic>ASCL1</italic> KO) cells by using CRISPR/Cas9 to create a frameshift-inducing deletion in the same iPSC line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We genomically screened 3 independent clones for frameshift mutations, differentiated them to DIV24 and performed ASCL1 detection by western blotting. All mutant clones showed an absence of ASCL1 protein even at high chemiluminescent exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), thus confirming the generation of <italic>ASCL1</italic>-null mutant cells. To address <italic>ASCL1</italic> function in iPSC-derived differentiating neural cultures, we performed scRNA-Seq on DIV24 cultures of the 3 <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO clones, yielding 35,755 single cells. When we projected this new single cell gene expression dataset onto the reference wild-type UMAP embedding from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, we found an increase in the number of cycling progenitors in mutant cells compared with wild-type controls, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the proportions of transitional progenitors and a near absence of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Moreover, the small number of mutant cells assigned to the transitional progenitors had a different transcriptional signature when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because projecting <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells onto the predefined WT UMAP embedding forces assignment into the graph based on gene expression pattern, we also independently integrated scRNA-seq datasets for <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO transcriptomes and assigned cluster identity based on the previously defined markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). This analysis corroborated the previous finding of transitional progenitor and neuron depletion in the <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2C,D</xref>). When <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO and wild-type cells are integrated, the de novo UMAP representation displays poor clustering of <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells with WT cells in the transitional progenitor and neuron clusters, also supporting that the overall transcriptional signatures are different in these two cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that loss of <italic>ASCL1</italic> impedes cell cycle exit and differentiation even in the presence of a potent NOTCH inhibitor, resulting in an accumulation of cells in a proliferating and undifferentiated state.</p><p id="P12">Because ASCL1 has been shown to drive changes in cell fate through its pioneer transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Wapinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized the same function could underlie its role in human neurogenesis. Therefore, we investigated <italic>ASCL1</italic> function in transcriptional regulation at DIV24. First, we analyzed transcriptional changes by bulk RNA sequencing of DIV24 cultures in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO vs control cells. We identified 2562 differentially expressed genes (fold change &gt; 1.5, q-value &lt; 0.05), including 1451 downregulated and 1111 upregulated genes in KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental File S1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We next sought to determine whether these transcriptional changes were due to functional binding activity of ASCL1. First we predicted the genome-wide map of enhancer-promoter interactions specific to our model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Fulco et al., 2019</xref>) using the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) computational algorithm. For this, we characterized the chromatin accessibility landscape by Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and the genomic profile of the H3K27ac histone mark (typically present at active enhancers and promoters) by ChIP-Seq in wild-type DIV24 cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Integrating the cell type-specific expression from our wild-type DIV24 RNA-Seq dataset, we were able to predict the enhancer-gene regulatory connections in our human differentiating neural culture system. We identified a repertoire of 23,662 active regulatory elements associated with 10,430 expressed genes (with each gene regulated by one or more elements) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental File S2</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then characterized the genomic binding profile of ASCL1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Analysis of ASCL1 ChIP-seq at DIV24 revealed 56,100 significant binding sites. The majority of these (70.3%) were intergenic or located in gene introns. The average distance between ASCL1 binding targets and nearest transcription start sites (TSS) was 33.3kb, with most (82.5%) locating more than 1kb from a TSS. Based on the ABC-predicted regulatory landscape, ASCL1 bound 17,049 active enhancer regions in WT DIV24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data are consistent with ASCL1 binding regulating neurogenesis by predominantly binding at distal regulatory elements, in agreement with observations in mouse models of neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>). Having thus defined the regulatory landscape in wild-type cells, we sought to characterize the role of <italic>ASCL1</italic> by investigating the effect of <italic>ASCL1</italic> depletion. From the genes found to be differentially expressed in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>), ASCL1 binds at least one of the ABC-predicted regulatory elements assigned to 1498 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This repertoire of 1498 herein termed “ASCL1-regulated genes” at DIV24 includes known markers of neuronal differentiation, e.g. neuronal genes <italic>TUBB3</italic> and <italic>DCX</italic> (downregulated in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells) and neuronal transcriptional repressor <italic>REST</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ballas et al., 2005</xref>)(upregulated in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental File S3</xref>). Gene Ontology analysis of the downregulated <italic>ASCL1</italic> target genes revealed an enrichment of biological processes linked to neuronal differentiation and neuronal activity. Conversely, GO terms associated with upregulated <italic>ASCL1</italic> target genes cells highlighted processes prominent in neural progenitors, including cell adhesion, cell proliferation and inhibition of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental File S3</xref>).

However, its pioneer activity in human neurogenesis, and specifically the activity of the endogenous protein, have not been explored. We therefore investigated whether the regulation of the identified <italic>ASCL1</italic>-regulated genes represented canonical features of pioneer transcription factor activity, with a functional interaction between binding of ASCL1 and chromatin accessibility. We first examined how ASCL1 binding correlated with chromatin state in DIV24 cultures by overlapping the wild-type ASCL1 ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets. We found that that 31.7% of the 56,100 ASCL1-bound sites in DIV24 cultures were in closed chromatin and 68.3% were in accessible chromatin in the ATAC-Seq dataset, revealing a strong correlation between ASCL1 binding and accessible chromatin at the time point when ASCL1 is highest expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, to investigate whether ASCL1 is involved in regulating chromatin structure, we examined chromatin accessibility in DIV24 <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cultures. We used the ATAC-Seq data to show that among the ASCL1-bound sites in open chromatin in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), 9156 (23.9%) showed changes in accessibility; 46.8% of these showed decreased accessibility in the <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO, and 53.2% regions showed increased accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Using our pre-determined ABC-predicted regulatory elements and connection with genes they are likely to regulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), we assigned 460 <italic>ASCL1</italic>-regulated genes to the loci of differential accessibility in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO vs. wild-type cells. Differential regulatory element accessibility was largely consistent with differential gene expression in the <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO: decreased accessibility was associated with decreased expression in 79.3% ASCL1-regulated genes; conversely, 74.9% of <italic>ASCL1</italic>-regulated genes showed increased accessibility of regulatory elements associated with increased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that pioneer TFs can promote both activation and repression of gene expression depending on secondary factors accessing the opened chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Hosokawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Zaret, 2020</xref>). Our analysis therefore supports that <italic>ASCL1</italic> controls expression of a fraction of its targets by regulating the chromatin accessibility landscape at active regulatory elements, herein termed “<italic>ASCL1</italic>-dependent” genes, thus acting as a pioneer transcription factor.</p><p id="P16">To gather further evidence for ASCL1 pioneer activity at these ASCL1-dependent sites, we examined the temporal dynamics of chromatin accessibility in differentiating neural cultures and its relationship with ASCL1 binding. We compared chromatin accessibility in wild-type cells at DIV24 with <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO neural cultures at DIV24 (when ASCL1 expression is at its peak), and with wild-type cultures 4 days earlier, at DIV20, when ASCL1 expression is still very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Because ATAC-Seq is a population-wide genomic assay and likely to reflect both direct and indirect effects of ASCL1 transcriptional activity, we focused our analysis on sites bound by ASCL1 (by ChIP-Seq) in wild-type DIV24 cultures. The first observation was that the accessibility profile of ASCL1 at the pre-bound state at DIV20 mirrored that of the <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO at DIV24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,E</xref>): 74.7% of sites differentially closed at DIV20 vs. wild-type DIV24 were also closed in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO DIV24 cells, supporting that the chromatin profile of the <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cultures mirrors the pre-bound state.</p><p id="P17">We then observed that sites that lost accessibility in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cultures fell into two categories: 50.3% of sites exhibited features of interaction with a classical pioneer factor, i.e. open in wild-type cells and completely closed in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cells (and similarly in DIV20 progenitors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, top); the remaining 49.7% sites showed a significant decrease in accessibility (fold change &gt; 1.5, q-value &lt; 0.05) but were not devoid of ATAC signal in <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cultures, contrary to the first category, i.e., chromatin was already permissive in the absence of ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom). This shows that ASCL1 pioneer activity is not required at those sites but its presence increases chromatin accessibility, suggesting that another factor is involved in opening chromatin at those sites and ASCL1 may act as partner to further remodel chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Henke et al., 2009</xref>). To explore this possibility further, we performed motif enrichment analysis separately on the first set of sites (where ASCL1 acts as a classical pioneer) and on the second set (where ASCL1 binds at permissive DNA and is required for further chromatin remodeling). In both categories, the top enriched motif discovered was a bHLH binding motif with the motif core containing the previously reported 5’-CAGCTG-3’ ASCL1 consensus binding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental File S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>). This lack of significant difference in motif analysis suggests that a non-sequence-specific DNA binding factor, e.g., a chromatin remodeling complex may be responsible for opening chromatin at those sites where ASCL1 is found to bind permissive DNA. We identified similar dynamics for the sites where ASCL1 represses chromatin accessibility, though here we found evidence for classical pioneer activity at only 15.6% of sites that are closed vs. open in wild-type DIV24 vs. <italic>ASCL1</italic> KO cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>, top). This is in keeping with a less prominent role of ASCL1 as a repressive pioneer factor as reported for other pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Hosokawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Wapinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Zaret, 2020</xref>). Overall, 23.5% of all ASCL1-dependent sites are subject to its “classical” pioneer activity in human neural cultures, i.e., binding to closed chromatin and remodeling state, while 68.2% of ASCL1 binding sites are consistent with chromatin remodeling at sites of already accessible DNA, i.e., with a non-pioneer chromatin remodeling activity at those sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref> bottom).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ASCL1 interacts with mSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers at sites where it acts as a pioneer factor</title><p id="P18">Given the evidence that ASCL1 acts as a chromatin remodeling factor (with or without pioneer activity) in differentiating human neural cultures, we hypothesized that ASCL1 may regulate chromatin states by interacting with chromatin remodelers, and specifically with ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). mSWI/SNF or BRG1/BRM associated factor (BAF) complexes are evolutionary conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes with pivotal roles in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Braun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>).

Core subunits are expressed at all stages of neural differentiation in these cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Confirming the relevance of the DIV24 timepoint in our experimental model and supporting the previously reported npBAF-nBAF subunit switch in mouse neurogenesis, we observed a decrease in the expression of progenitor-specific subunits ACTL6A, SS18 and DPF1/DPF3, accompanied by an increase in the expression of neuronal-specific subunits ACTL6B, SS18L1 and DPF2/PHF10, as cells differentiated from neural progenitors into postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>).

We found that 90.3% SMARCB1 binding sites overlapped with nucleosome-depleted regions previously identified by ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>) consistent with its role in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Iurlaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Schick et al., 2019</xref>). Assuming that the physical interaction between ASCL1 and mSWI/SNF is involved in chromatin regulation, we then overlapped ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and SMARCB1 binding sites: 54.9% of the ASCL1 targets in open configuration at DIV24 also displayed SMARCB1 binding, while only 5.8% ASCL1 targets in closed configuration in DIV24 were co-bound by SMARCB1, indicating that co-recruitment relates to accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Moreover, examining the SMARCB1 ChIP-Seq data, we found that at most of the 46.9% remaining sites, there is some SMARCB1 ChIP-Seq signal that is below threshold for peak calling.

We first investigated how BRM014 treatment affected mSWI/SNF complex enzymatic activity by examining its effect on chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in BRM014-treated and control cells. We found that BRM014-treated cells presented reduced chromatin accessibility at 3,664 genomic sites and increased accessibility at 277 sites (q &lt; 0.5), with 68.6% of the changes in accessibility occurring at SMARCB1 ChIP-Seq binding sites.

ASCL1 regulates hundreds of genes in neural differentiation cultures, and we find evidence for direct binding of distal regulatory elements in transitional progenitors. Investigating ASCL1’s pioneer transcription factor function, we identified two groups of regulated loci: those where ASCL1 acts as a classical pioneer TF, and another where it binds permissive DNA and is required to promote further chromatin changes. This latter group is reminiscent of the “non-classical pioneer factor” class proposed by Minderjahn et al.

Cooperative interaction between ASCL1 and ATPase-active SWI/SNF is greatest at regulatory elements where ASCL1 acts as a non-pioneer chromatin remodeler (53.1% of sites). Conversely, at loci where ASCL1 acts as a classical pioneer factor, although a subset of the loci is co-bound by mSWI/SNF (12.7%), they do not require its presence to elicit changes in chromatin structure. We observe that interfering with chromatin remodeling (<italic>ASCL1</italic> KO or mSWI/SNF activity inhibition) results in significant reduction in binding of the cooperative partner, though residual binding of mSWI/SNF in the absence of ASCL1 is presumably sufficient for some degree of accessibility. This suggests that the ASCL1-mSWI/SNF interaction may act to stabilize mSWI/SNF at its targets, and that in the absence of ASCL1 mSWI/SNF releases from DNA more readily.</p><p id="P32">Using molecularly defined active regulatory regions (i.e with ATAC-Seq and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq signals), we computationally defined enhancer-gene pairs regulated by the ASCL1-mSWI/SNF interaction. Genes co-regulated by this interaction and where ASCL1 acts as a non-pioneer chromatin remodeler were enriched for ontology terms associated with cell differentiation, brain development and neurotransmitter processes, supporting a role in directing neural differentiation. There are fewer co-regulated genes where ASCL1 acts as a classical pioneer TF, yet these include important neuronal genes, including <italic>BCL11B</italic> (Supplemental file 3), encoding transcription factor BCL11B/CTIP2 expressed in deep layer cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Simon et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that similar to OCT4-SMARCA4 interaction regulating pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">King and Klose, 2017</xref>), the pioneer ASCL1-SWI/SNF interaction may facilitate binding of other TFs important for neural differentiation, though further studies would be required to confirm that.</p><p id="P33">One possibility for the distinct requirements of SWI/SNF as an interacting partner at classical pioneer and non-pioneer sites of chromatin remodeling is that different loci may have architectural constraints that either require or limit ASCL1-DNA interaction. ASCL1 in an heterodimer with bHLH E-proteins, binds an E-box motif with degenerate central two nucleotides (5’-CANNTG-3’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). We did not find evidence for differences in binding motifs at sites of classical and non-pioneer chromatin remodeler activity, therefore we speculate that as per the previously reported ASCL1 pioneer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), cooperative binding between ASCL1 and mSWI/SNF may be determined by factors such as histone modifications, which we do not explore here. A limitation of the study is that molecular characterization of the system is not performed at the single cell level apart from scRNA-Seq. Since ASCL1 is expressed primarily in transitional progenitors, we can assume the ChIP-Seq binding profiles are specific to these cells. However the ATAC-Seq profile reflects the whole cultured cell population, and moreover, as with other DNA accessibility techniques, ATAC-Seq does not perform well on detection of partially unwrapped nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). Thus it is possible that the non-pioneer chromatin remodeler ASCL1 repertoire and cooperative binding of mSWI/SNF at those sites represent heterogeneous states that will be more readily deciphered with higher resolution analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hainer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Harada et al., 2021</xref>). As we find cooperative binding for only a small subset of ASCL1 classical pioneer targets, we note that we did not investigate other chromatin remodelers than mSWI/SNF which may act with ASCL1 in regulating chromatin structure at sites of classical pioneer activity.</p><p id="P34">The use of a constitutive knock-out of ASCL1 rather than conditional ablation may also be a limitation of the study. However, the observation that the chromatin accessibility landscape of knockout cells at ASCL1 peak expression (DIV24) is similar to that of wild-type cells at a timepoint preceding significant ASCL1 expression (DIV20; pre-bound state) suggests that constitutive loss does not have a significant effect prior to NOTCH inhibition and the sharp increase in ASCL1 expression at DIV23-24. Conversely, while we ablated mSWI/SNF enzymatic activity preserving protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Iurlaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Papillon et al., 2018</xref>), we cannot exclude ATPase-independent roles for mSWI/SNF, which might be required at sites of ASCL1 classical pioneer activity bound by mSWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Jordán-Pla et al., 2018</xref>). Having focused our attention on the cooperative functions of ASCL1 and mSWI/SNF, further investigations are also required to explore whether the roles of mSWI/SNF in the transition from neural progenitors to neurons in mouse neurogenesis are replicated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Staahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>), and whether these roles reflect predominantly mSWI/SNF’s interaction with ASCL1, or also interactions with other neurogenic factors.</p><p id="P35">Our findings of a regulatory interaction between ASCL1 and mSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers in controlling the neurogenic process may have implications beyond ASCL1’s role in neural development. Glioblastomas respond to overexpression of ASCL1 by terminally differentiating proliferating cells, thus restricting tumor expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Park et al., 2017</xref>).
