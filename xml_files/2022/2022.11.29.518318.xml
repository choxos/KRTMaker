This is highly relevant in the field of biomedical implants and grafts. Using advanced computer-aided design (CAD) and computational modeling (CM) tools, complex implants are being developed which offer better mechanics (reduced weight and increased load-bearing capability, etc.) or patient safety and comfort, as replacements of simpler implants. For example, the designs of arterial stents have transitioned from the conventional porous shapes to auxetic architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), which allow easy radial expansion of the stents while reducing the risk of stent malapposition and foreshortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Such auxetic shapes have also recently paved the way to a new range of patches and tissue grafts for regenerative applications such as those repairing cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and pulmonary pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), where auxetic patches allow easy conformation to organ deformation and outperform non-auxetic patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In addition, auxetic structures are increasingly being used as actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) or load-bearing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Furthermore, advanced CAD and CM tools are increasingly being used in tissue engineering to design complex perfusable structures, such as perfusable vascularized biomimetic tissue models for studying biogenesis and disease progression and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Unfortunately, to this date, CAD and CM still largely require manually defining the complex geometrical relationships and boundary conditions. Furthermore, one needs to analyze a wide array of design iterations to derive the optimized design for the application. For example, auxetic patches developed for different dynamic organs (lung, heart, etc.) need to conform to the stiffness and Poisson’s ratios of the different organs, and may require analyzing hundreds of design iterations and their computational modeling to find the right patch design for an organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Herein, we present a new algorithmic approach to designing complex shapes within seconds, which can rapidly generate a large array of design iterations within minutes.</p><p id="P3">To fabricate the complex shapes, additive manufacturing techniques involving layer-by-layer material deposition offer a wide range of achievable resolution (typically 10 – 500 μm) and throughput (0.01 – 1000 mm<sup>3</sup>/hr). Recently, volumetric printing (VP), also termed as volumetric additive manufacturing, has emerged as a powerful technique towards the fabrication of high-resolution structures (up to 100 μm) within tens of seconds. VP relies on computed axial lithography, where the vial containing photocrosslinkable resin (photoresin) is rotated with dynamically evolving light patterns (images) projected into the resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The superposition of the projected images leads to a spatially localized increase in the free radicals produced from the photoinitiator, which induces crosslinking of the photoresin into the desired shape. The photo-rheology of the resins used in VP typically depicts a non-linear response, where the crosslinking is induced after a threshold of light dose is achieved. There are also non-rotational methods involving image projections from multiple sides (typically front, side and bottom) to generate a spatially localized increase in light dose within the photocrosslinkable matrix, which induces crosslinking of the material into the desired shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Compared to multi-direction projections, computed tomography leads to better resolution and shape fidelity of the printed construct as the image can be changed continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We recently demonstrated that the tomographic printing duration can be further reduced to only a few seconds by using thiol-ene photoclick chemistry-based resins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Herein, insensitivity to oxygen and a homogeneous network formation within the step-growth polymerized matrices can reduce internal structural stresses and shrinkage after printing compared to constructs resulting from chain-growth polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Further, refractive index (RI) matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and fine-tuning of light dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) has enabled high resolution printing while allowing encapsulation of high density of cells and organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), which are critical to biomimetic tissue engineering. In an attempt to set a roadmap for high throughput design and fabrication of biomedical implants and grafts, we demonstrate how the complex algorithmically designed structures can be rapidly synthesized using photoclickable gelatin-based matrices within VP.</p><p id="P4">Furthermore, applications of VP have been limited to constructs based on single material compositions, and there is a critical need for new methods to fabricate multi-material structures, which can widen the applicability of VP into biomimetic structures as well as tissue and disease models. In this work, we demonstrate new approaches for multimaterial VP (Multimat VP). We print selected architectures with different photoresin compositions along the length or the thickness of the constructs. Further we demonstrate how the designs can be wrapped around more complex objects such as a heart, which paves the way for rapidly printing organ-specific auxetic meshes. Finally, we also highlight how complex multimaterial perfusable architectures such as alveoli can be rapidly designed and fabricated using our approach. The synergy of algorithmic design, photoclick chemistry and Multimat VP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) offers a transformational approach to rapidly designing and fabricating complex multimaterial shapes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid algorithmic design and multimaterial volumetric printing of auxetic meshes</title><p id="P5">Auxetic shapes serve as an ideal template for algorithmic design as the structural interrelationships can be defined via governing equations. 2D auxetic meshes have been increasingly utilized as patches which feature tailorable negative Poisson’s ratios and directional stiffness to easily conform to dynamic organs such as the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) or the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> illustrates the algorithmic design scheme for auxetic meshes featuring re-entrant honeycomb, sinusoidal ligaments, arrowhead and pinwheel meshes. All of these meshes feature different stiffness and Poisson’s ratios, which can be selectively matched to different dynamic organs (e.g., lung, heart, stomach, bladder, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The equations governing the design algorithms have been provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref>. Briefly, for re-entrant honeycomb meshes, vertical baselines containing the vertices of the mesh elements are established at a defined separation, followed by offsetting the position of every alternate vertex either ahead (positive offset) or behind (negative offset) the baseline. Herein, every consecutive baseline has opposing offsetting of the vertices (i.e., if the vertex at any baseline has a positive offset from the vertex, then the consecutive baseline will have a negative offset from the vertex). Next, the vertices are connected along the vertical direction, followed by connecting alternate vertices which are at positive and negative offset, along the horizontal direction. For the arrowhead architectures, the meshes are offset such that each baseline features the same offset pattern of the vertices. The vertices are then connected such that the negative offset vertices of any baseline are connected to the positive offset vertices along the consecutive baseline. For creating the sinusoidal ligament meshes, sine functions are created with period length (2π) spanning two baselines, and the sinusoidal mesh in every other baseline is shifted by a phase spanning the distance between two consecutive baselines. The pinwheel meshes are fabricated in a similar way, except there is no offset between the sinusoids across the baselines. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, we present select architectures created by changing dimensions of the auxetic design features. Using this algorithmic approach, several hundred iterations of any auxetic mesh can be rapidly created (average compilation time per design on a personal computer at 1.3 GHz and 32 GB RAM was 0.04 s).</p><p id="P6">With auxetic meshes as the template, we present the first scheme for the rapid Multimat VP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Here, the inner mesh is created using tomographic projections in a vial filled with thermo-reversibly crosslinked rhodamine-labeled fluorescent resin containing norbornene-modified gelatin (GelNB) and thiolated gelatin (GelSH) at 5% w/v (total gelatin content) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (see dose optimization and resolution tests for different photoclick materials in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). After the first tomographic projection, the mesh is localized in the resin container by projecting supporting beams (<underline>created by projecting a circular image (Φ = 3 mm) for 5 s without rotating the vial</underline>) at the top of the mesh. This prevents the printed structure from falling when the vial is heated up to 37°C to remove the non-photocrosslinked resin. The resin in the container is then interchanged with a FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-labeled resin, followed by tomographic projections of the outer mesh. Addition of either Rhodamine or FITC did not affect the absorption of light at 405 nm and the RI of the resin (RI = 1.34 for GelNB/GelSH), thereby not affecting the light path during tomographic projections.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> demonstrates the rapidly fabricated (25 s total printing time) bi-layered auxetic mesh comprising of different resin compositions (Rhod-labeled and FITC-labeled GelNB/GelSH) and vertically and horizontally oriented re-entrant honeycomb meshes in the first and second layers, respectively. The images have been captured using light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and the supporting pillars facilitate image capturing by stabilizing the constructs within the printing vials. Notably, post photocrosslinking, the RI of the GelNB/GelSH resin increases by ~0.002 (i.e., RI = 1.342), which, as per our observations, did not critically affect the feature dimensions. The minimum feature size of the second layer (~ 275 μm) was within ±5% as that of the first layer (~ 264 μm).</p><p id="P7">Of note, the supporting pillars in the first Multimat VP scheme need to be removed post printing. The second printing scheme for Multimat VP does not require projection of supporting pillars. This scheme is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. The scheme utilizes filling the first resin in the printing vial, followed by adding the second resin. Here, the two resin compositions are prevented from mixing into each other through thermo-reversible crosslinking of each resin formulation at 4°C prior to adding the subsequent one. Alternatively, a high viscosity resin could also be used to prevent mixing of the resins during the short printing duration. After the different resins are added, the entire construct is printed at once via tomographic projections (printing time 12 s). We use this Multimat VP technique to fabricate a re-entrant honeycomb mesh with vertically oriented elements featuring FITC and Rhod-labeled GelNB/GelSH resin in the bottom and top portions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of note, the supporting beams are still added to the construct to suspend it within the printing vial, which facilitates its imaging using light sheet microscopy. Here, gelatin-based resin has been used since it allows the layers to thermo-reversibly crosslink when the temperature is reduced, thereby preventing the photocrosslinked structures from falling under their own weight due to gravity. The gelatin could also be replaced with other materials such as pluronic or hyaluronic acid, etc., provided they increase the viscosity substantially to prevent the structures from displacing during the short printing duration. This Multimat VP approach can be used to print tissue interfaces. As an example, we printed the same auxetic mesh with GelNB/GelSH across the top and bottom, but the top compartment consisted of myoblasts (C2C12 murine), and the bottom compartment consisted of fibroblasts (3T3 murine), labelled with cell tracker red and green, respectively. After 4 weeks of maturation, the top compartment selectively exhibited myo-heavy chain staining, while both compartments featured collagen I staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rapid algorithmic design and multimaterial volumetric printing of auxetic cylinders</title><p id="P8">Cylindrical auxetic meshes, such as those increasingly being used for fabrication of stents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) can be even more complicated to design when compared to 2D meshes, especially when the design elements need to form a continuum across a cylindrical contour. Here, creating design iterations of the auxetic cylinders is particularly challenging.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> illustrates the algorithmic design scheme of cylindrical auxetic meshes featuring re-entrant honeycomb and sinusoidal ligament elements (detailed equations have been provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref>). The design schemes of auxetic cylinders featuring arrowhead or pinwheel architectures have been provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>. For creating any auxetic mesh, we first convert the cartesian coordinate system to a cylindrical coordinate system to be able to create a cylinder and define points on it. For auxetic cylinders featuring vertically-oriented re-entrant honeycomb lattices, we create vertical zigzag lines by defining the coordinates of all corner points alternating on two sides of a base line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The alternate corner points lie along parallel circles with a phase shift commensurate with the width of the re-entrant meshes. After all the corner points of the vertical zigzag lines are defined, these are connected with straight beams. To match the cylinder curvature, every point on the initial straight beam is translated onto the cylinder using a wrapping algorithm (details provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref>). Finally, to create the horizontal beams, every second pair of neighboring points on each ring of the cylinder is connected by an arc using the same wrapping method, with the positions of the horizontal beams alternating along the axis of the cylinder. For auxetic cylinders featuring horizontally oriented re-entrant honeycomb meshes, the corner points of each zigzag ring are composed of two circles consisting of points with a certain phase shift and angular step to each other. After defining all corner points of the zigzag rings, these can be connected. Before generating the connecting beams, every beam between two corner points is translated onto the cylinder coat using the wrapping method used previously. Finally, vertical beams are constructed between neighboring zigzag rings. For the auxetic cylinders with sinusoidal ligament meshes, sinusoidal functions are created along the cylinder, with consecutive functions featuring a phase shift with the previous sinusoid. Next, a vertical sine wave is generated to create the auxetic cylinders with sinusoidal elements. The starting and ending points of a vertical line are on the crossing points of the bottom and top circles and their baselines respectively. Similar to the 2D auxetic meshes, this algorithmic design scheme allows us to create a wide array of cylinders within a matter of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">These auxetic architectures can also be printed within 12 s using photoclick resins within VP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using the first Multimat VP strategy of using support pillars to allow the construct to be suspended in the printing vial, which allows changing of the resin and re-printing, we also demonstrate how multimaterial and multidesign auxetic cylindrical meshes can be fabricated.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> demonstrates auxetic cylindrical meshes made of FITC-labeled GelNB/GelSH in the shape of horizontally-oriented re-entrant honeycomb mesh in the inner layer, and Rhod-labeled GelNB/GelSH in the shape of vertically-oriented re-entrant honeycomb mesh in the outer layer, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Algorithmically-defined computational models for rapid screening of structural mechanics</title><p id="P10">Similar to algorithmic design, we show that algorithmic computational modeling can also substantially accelerate the process of determining the mechanics of a wide array of complex structures. Here we use the auxetic meshes and cylinders as the templates for our finite cell method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)-based computational models. As opposed to the conventional approaches, the embedded simulation approach eliminates the necessity of the labor-intensive procedure for meshing and defining of boundary constraints. Instead, the geometry is embedded in a regular grid with vanishing stiffness. The physical model is then recovered by applying a voxel-based integration rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Using this methodology allowed us to computationally model the auxetic meshes and cylinders at an average duration of approximately 4.5 s and 30 s, respectively, in a 1.3 GHz personal computer with 32 GB RAM. As a result, we were able to quickly derive the Poisson’s ratios of thousands of auxetic structures without any manual intervention. The corresponding results have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The deformation of selected meshes have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. Of these, the re-entrant meshes demonstrate the widest range of Poisson’s ratios (from 0.1 to - 10.9,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) based on the different combinations of the design features (n1, n2 and t). In contrast to the auxetic meshes, the auxetic designs for cylinders (selected outputs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) did not demonstrate negative Poisson’s ratios, but a wide range of positive Poisson’s ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This means that the cylinders are actually contracting when they are stretched radially, even though the meshes feature auxetic designs. Here, the horizontally-oriented auxetic cylinders demonstrate Poisson’s ratios varying from 0.2 to 1.1 based on different combinations of the design features (h, v and t). Such a wide range of Poisson’s ratios for the different meshes and cylinders offers unique applications such as in actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), large structural components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) or organ-specific patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Organ-specific auxetic meshes</title><p id="P11">To demonstrate the level of design complexity that the algorithmic schemes can address, we demonstrate how the auxetic meshes can be wrapped around more complex shapes such as the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Here, we start with a square 2D auxetic mesh, which is intersected with a circle to derive a circular mesh. Then, all points of this circular mesh are wrapped onto a sphere. The formation of a curved mesh is an essential step, as it facilitates the wrapping algorithm to identify the points within the mesh closest to the surface of the heart models. After the curved is constructed, the heart model (in this case, a standard tessellation language (STL) file derived from an online repository(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)) is placed into the curved auxetic sheet such that they intersect slightly with each other, which improves the wrapping result in the next step. Finally, every point on the auxetic sheet is projected onto the bottom of the heart by computing the point on the heart surface with the smallest distance to a given point on the curved sheet. As with previous shapes, all the different kinds of auxetic meshes can be wrapped onto the heart this way (average design compilation time ~ 0.2 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref> for additional shape iterations). The corresponding governing equations for the design schemes are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref>, and other simpler shapes such as spheres are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>. Here, we select the sinusoidal meshes to demonstrate their rapid printability over a heart model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). For this, we first volumetrically print a heart using unlabeled GelNB/GelSH resin, followed by projecting supporting pillars and swapping the non-photocrosslinked resin with Rhod-labeled GelNB/GelSH. The auxetic mesh around the heart is then rapidly volumetrically printed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>. Notably, the auxetic meshes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref> were printed directly over the heart to allow better visualization of the mesh by maintaining its shape. We foresee that such complex shapes may one-day pave the way for patient-specific grafts or patches which can conform to the shape of the organ.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Algorithmic design of perfusable architectures</title><p id="P12">Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithmic design and Multimat VP schemes can be used to design and fabricate simple and complex perfusable structures. In the first design scheme, we design a cuboid consisting of a hollow spheroidal center and six perfusable channels around the sphere. The channels are created as a hyperbolic sine function and a circular pattern is created by copying the sine functions 7 times around the center axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Next, the channels are mirrored with an offset in the middle, followed by connecting the mirrored and original parts through straight channels. By changing the amplitude of the hyperbolic sine function or the diameter of the channels, a variety of perfusable shapes can be created within seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). These channels are then removed from a cuboidal shape. In addition, a sphere with a pre-set offset with the channels is also removed from the cuboid to result in the perfusable construct with a hollow sphere in-between. To fabricate a construct featuring perfusable channels surrounding a matrix of different material, we introduce the third Multimat VP approach – prefabricated construct integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). In this approach, a FITC-labeled GelNB/GelSH sphere is fabricated, followed by extracting the same and integrating within another resin container partially filled with unlabeled GelNB/GelSH resin. The resin is kept at 24°C to allow easy integration of the sphere. More unlabeled GelNB/GelSH resin is then filled over the construct, and the cuboidal construct with hollow sphere and perfusable channels printed such that the pre-fabricated spherical construct is accommodated within the hollow spherical center in the construct. Perfusing Rhod-labeled GelNB/GelSH into the channels allows us to image the sample using light sheet microscopy, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, where the central FITC-labeled sphere is surrounded by a network of Rhod-labeled channels. We foresee that such synergistic algorithmic design and Multimat VP approach can find potential applications in disease-on-a-chip models, for instance, a tumor surrounded by a network of capillaries which demonstrate neovascularization to the tumor site. Such a model can be used to study the effects of biological (macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), etc.) or non-biological therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) on tumor metastasis or angiogenesis.</p><p id="P13">The algorithmic design framework is not just limited to simple perfusable shapes but can also be expanded to more complex shapes such as alveoli surrounded with a perfusable vessel network. The alveolus is created by dividing a sphere into several smaller spheres bound by the periphery of the sphere, followed by scaling-up individual spheres to create the budding alveolus structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The vessel network surrounding the alveolus is first created as a regular icosahedron (see governing equations in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref>). Next, every equilateral triangle along the face of the icosahedron is divided into four identical equilateral triangles by connecting the midpoints of all edges. This process can be repeated to further divide the triangles and create denser structures with smaller hexagons. Then, for every equilateral triangle, its geometric center is connected with the midpoint of each edge to create the vessel network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Further, to improve the quality of prints and avoid intersection with the top cylinder later, the vessel network on the top is enlarged by factor 2 to create a bigger opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). A thickness gradient is introduced to the vessels, such that the thickness decreases gradually from the left and right ends of the shape towards the middle. Then every edge of the icosahedron is interpolated to create 11 equidistant intermediate points, i.e. 10 sub-beams per edge, followed by wrapping each onto the circumscribed sphere of the icosahedron. The result is a spherical vessel shape which can be used for wrapping. The alveolus is placed such that it is concentric with the vessel shape, and every beam on the vessel shape is interpolated into 10 sub-beams and wrapped onto the alveolus by computing the point on the alveolar surface with the smallest distance to a given point on the vessel network. Then a cylinder is created and placed on top of the alveolus, and inlet and outlet ports added such that the inlet/outlet port intersects with a branching point of the vessel network. We can also create an offset by using a larger alveolar shape for wrapping of the vessels, then placing a smaller alveolar shape concentrically for the final shape. By changing the offset, vessel diameters and their densities, we can generate a wide array of alveoli and surrounding vessel shapes (average design compilation time ~ 0.5 s) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>. In the model we used for printing, we used a gap of 250 μm between the alveolus and the vessels. The alveoli and the vessel network were removed from a cylindrical construct to create perfusable channels and a hollow portion to accommodate the alveolus. The alveolus construct for printing was also hollowed-out by removing a scaled-down shape from the original alveolus. The printing scheme utilized first printing the alveolar shape, using FITC-labeled GelNB/GelSH, followed by supporting pillar projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). This was followed by swapping resin with unlabeled GelNB/GelSH and printing the hollow construct (see the printed constructs during different stages in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Finally, Uncrosslinked Rhod-labeled GelNB/GelSH at 37°C is perfused in the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>), and the entire construct exposed to 405 nm UV light to crosslink the resin in the channels. In our future work, we plan to print different vessel densities followed by seeding of epithelial cells to create lung-on-chip models, which can be used to study pulmonary pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">The algorithmic design scheme offers a transformational approach towards facile creation of a wide array of complex shapes, such as the auxetic meshes and cylinders, organ-specific grafts or perfusable alveoli structures which we demonstrated in this work. The algorithms can rapidly process a wide array of point-point connections (such as wrapping functions, segmentation of icosahedron triangles into smaller triangles, connective lattice elements of auxetic shapes, etc.) which would be tedious and time-consuming to execute manually. Once the design scheme is established for any shape, the shapes can be easily iterated by inputting the ranges and increments for the important parameters, which is otherwise a daunting task to perform in conventional CAD softwares. This difference in designing and iterating is even more profound as the shape complexity increases, with the introduction of organ-specific auxetic meshes and the alveolar structures. Here the algorithms ensure that the interconnections between the constitutive points or contours are satisfied when a new shape iteration is formed. We have shown that algorithm-based computational modeling schemes can allow rapid screening of the mechanical properties of large arrays of complex architectures. Here, integration of the iterative algorithmic design and computational modeling within a deep learning framework can lead to a powerful framework for shape optimization(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Our future work will entail expanding the computational modeling to simulate fluid flow within perfusable architectures.</p><p id="P15">We have made the design and simulation code available in the GitHub repository (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">“Data and materials availability”</xref> section). For users who are not adept at coding, we have created graphical user interfaces where the users can load their own models, to be able to design their own custom auxetic patches or perfusable networks with varying vessel densities. Using the interface, the users can also iterate the designs of the auxetic and perfusable shapes demonstrated in the present work for their own applications. In addition, dedicated libraries have been established which can be used for executing the structural simulations or for creating porosities within constructs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In this work, we deployed three techniques for the rapid volumetric printing of multi-material constructs: <bold>1</bold>. Tomographic projection printing of first layer of the construct supported by projected pillars, followed by swapping of the uncrosslinked resin with a different composition and tomographic projection printing of the subsequent layer. <bold>2</bold>. Filling the printing vials with two different resin compositions and tomographic projection printing of the entire construct at once. <bold>3</bold>. Incorporating a prefabricated construct into a resin-filled container, followed by tomographic projections to fabricate the multimaterial constructs. The rationale for which Multimat VP method needs to be used would depend on the complexity of the structure that needs to be fabricated, and the resin composition. While the first scheme offers tremendous design freedom (we printed multi-material auxetic cylinders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) auxetic mesh on heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) or perfusable alveolar models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) using this method), aligning subsequent projections with the first projection is often challenging. Furthermore, removal of the supporting beams after printing can lead to material losses and may even be difficult to execute for fragile constructs. For multi-material constructs such as tissue interfaces, the second scheme can be a more robust scheme to align the two layers (such as the bilayered auxetic meshes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, for resin compositions which do not undergo thermo-reversible crosslinking, the second scheme may cause mixing of the two resins across different regions, especially when the resin viscosity is low. In such a case, the remaining two strategies are a better choice. Notably, we have used the same base material of the resin when performing more than one tomographic projection to make the constructs (i.e., first and third strategy). Since the change in RI before and after crosslinking of GelNB/GelSH resin was small (ΔRI = 0.002), we did not observe a substantial difference in resolution between the first and second projections. However, if the base material is different between the projections, the differences in RI between the photocrosslinked constructs can cause unwanted scattering or diffraction of light which may affect the print resolution and quality. Similar constraints may also apply to the third strategy of prefabricated construct integration. In this case, RI matching agents such as Iodixanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) can be used to fine-tune the RI of the resins and achieve high resolution prints.</p><p id="P17">While we only demonstrated two resin compositions within the printed constructs in the present work, the techniques can be easily adapted to more than two material compositions to create more complex constructs. For example, bioinks pertaining to bone, tendon and muscle can be sequentially added into the print vial for the fabrication of bone-tendon-muscle interfaces. Here, while the bone construct could feature a porous matrix (see foaming algorithm outcomes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>), a fascicular arrangement of muscle and tendon may be difficult to achieve via tomographic projections. Therein, hybridization of VP with filamented light projection (FLight, a technology developed in our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>)) could allow one to fabricate the muscle and tendon interfaces with fascicular arrangement of muscle fibers or aligned collagen in tendons, while the bone can be tomographically projected to create a porous matrix. In fact, hybridization can also be performed with other printing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). For example, extrusion printing of photoresins can be used to control the spatial distribution of different materials within the resin container. Subsequently, single tomographic projection can be used to create the multimaterial constructs. Such hybridization schemes will be the future scope of our investigation. Naturally, for tissue engineering purposes, imparting a macroscopic vasculature and further inducing neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) will be a key aspect to allow physiological-scale tissue fabrication.</p><p id="P18">For this work, in order to demonstrate rapid printing, photoclick materials based on step-growth polymerization were ideal as we have established expertise on high speed volumetric printing using these materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, the materials demonstrated in this work may not be suitable towards all biomedical or structural applications as the modulus is small (~ 10-100 kPa). Herein, one could also use chain-growth polymerization, which is typically found in acrylate or methacrylate-based resins, to obtain stiffer structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) with minor compromises on the fabrication duration as the rate of photopolymerization is slow (e.g. volumetric printing of gelatin methacrylate takes ~ 30 s/cm<sup>3</sup> of construct, while GelNB/GelSH take ~ 8 s/cm<sup>3</sup> of constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)). Future research on photoclick-compatible materials or their hybridization schemes, which yield higher stiffness constructs, could improve the applicability of the materials to a wider variety of biomedical applications such as polymer-based arterial stents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) or tracheal grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Further, current volumetric printing approaches have been limited to constructs spanning only a few centimeters in sizes, and future research on tomographic projections within larger containers can circumvent such size limitations. As such, one also does not need to use volumetric printing or deploy photocrosslinkable materials. The shapes generated and optimized through the algorithmic design and computational modeling schemes can be fabricated though conventional or bespoke manufacturing processes integrated into larger assembly lines, as long as the complexity of the shape can be achieved. For example, the algorithmic schemes could help speed up product design and optimization of prosthetic implants or metallic stents, to even vehicle drive shafts and engines, which could bring about substantial cost-savings in the product pipeline. This work can potentially transform the way engineers or scientists approach new design problems and develop solutions that have the potential to benefit society at large.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Algorithmic design</title><p id="P19">Hyperganic core (an algorithmic engineering platform developed by Hyperganic GmbH) environment was used to run the algorithmic design schemes written in C#.

For formulation of GelNB, porcine-derived (Type A) gelatin was dissolved in 0.5 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH~9, obtained by adding 38.2 g/l of sodium bicarbonate and 4.7d/l of sodium carbonate in deionized (DI) water) at 50°C to get a 10% w/v solution. After obtaining a clear solution under stirring, carbic anhydride was added at a concentration of 100 mg/g of gelatin. After letting the reaction proceed for 1 h, the solution was dialyzed (at 40°C) with frequent DI water changes (2 per day) for 5 days. The matrix was then lyophilized for 4 days and stored at -20°C until further use. For formulation of GelSH, porcine-derived (Type A) gelatin was dissolved in 0.15 M MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) buffer (pH~4) at 50°C to get a 2% w/v solution. When completely dissolved, DTPHY (3,3’-Dithiobis(propionohydrazide)) was added at 95 mg/g of gelatin while stirring.

Next, TCEP was added at 344 mg/g of gelatin, followed by continuing the reduction reaction for 6 hours. Finally, 1g of NaCl was added and the solution dialysed against DI water balanced to pH 4.5 with diluted HCl.

For both resin formulations, 0.05% w/v LAP (Lithium phenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphinate) was used as the photoinitiator.

FITC is conjugated to the resin matrix through amide bond formation with the primary amines of the matrix, while Rhod-Acr conjugates to GelSH through thiolene reaction during printing. The amounts of FITC and Rhod-Acr do not affect the light dose of the resin compared to a non-labeled resin.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Multimat volumetric printing</title><p id="P23">The open format volumetric printer from Readily3D was used for these experiments. This printer allowed for each resin swapping and visualization of the constructs during and after printing. Procedures for Multimat VP have been discussed in the results section. Here we provide necessary details for replicability. Prior to printing, dose tests were performed by projecting an array of circles (ϕ = 1 mm) featuring a variation of light intensity onto a 3 mm path length cuvette filled with the resin. Diameters of the projected cylinders were then measured using bright field microscopy and the light dose allowing for the diameter to be 1 ± 0.05 mm (dimensions measured in ImageJ) was chosen. For all prints, 18 mm printing vials were used. After filling-in the desired volume of the resin – 4 ml per layer for single material VPs and 3 ml per material for the MultiMat VP experiments, the resin was allowed to thermo-reversibly crosslink for 5 min at 4°C. This allowed stability of the printed structure during photocrosslinking. To remove the non-crosslinked resin (to swap the resin in between different tomographic projections or at the end of the printing), the vial was kept at 37°C for 5 min, followed by washing with warm (37°C) PBS twice. The supporting pillars were fabricated in a sequential manner: First a single circular beam projection at highest laser power permissible by the printing system (64 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used for 10 s to print the first pillar.
