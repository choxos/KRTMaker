To shed light on these in the context of liver function, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic profiling of livers from 17 COVID-19 decedents. We identified hepatocytes positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an expression phenotype resembling infected lung epithelial cells. Integrated analysis and comparisons with healthy controls revealed extensive changes in the cellular composition and expression states in COVID-19 liver, reflecting hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis. We also observed Kupffer cell proliferation and erythrocyte progenitors for the first time in a human liver single-cell atlas, resembling similar responses in liver injury in mice and in sepsis, respectively. Despite the absence of a clinical acute liver injury phenotype, endothelial cell composition was dramatically impacted in COVID-19, concomitantly with extensive alterations and profibrogenic activation of reactive cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells. Our atlas provides novel insights into liver physiology and pathology in COVID-19 and forms a foundational resource for its investigation and understanding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>single-nucleus sequencing</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">COVID-19 exhibits a wide phenotypic spectrum with potential multi-organ involvement during its acute phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, including liver-related pathology.

After incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody for 1.5 hours, detection was performed with the Vectastatin Elite ABC-HRP kit (Vector Laboratories, SP-6100) with the DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, SK-4100), followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S41"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended Figure 1</label><caption><p id="P75">(A) Number of cells per donor for each cluster.
