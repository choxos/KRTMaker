Microtubule posttranslational modifications (PTMs) contribute to microtubule diversity and differentially regulate motor-mediated transport. Here we show that centrosome amplification induces a global change in organelle positioning towards the cell periphery and facilitates nuclear migration through confined spaces. This reorganisation requires kinesin-1 and is analogous to loss of dynein. Cells with amplified centrosomes display increased levels of acetylated tubulin, a PTM known to enhance kinesin-1 mediated transport. Depletion of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1) to block tubulin acetylation, which has no impact on control cells, rescues the displacement of centrosomes, mitochondria and vimentin, but not Golgi or endosomes. Analyses of the distribution of acetylated microtubules indicates that the polarisation of modified microtubules, rather than levels alone, plays an important role in organelle positioning. We propose that tubulin acetylation differentially impacts kinesin-1-mediated organelle displacement, suggesting that each organelle must have its own sensing and response mechanisms to ensure fine-tuning of its distribution in cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Main</title><p id="P3">Eukaryotic cells display a conserved interconnected arrangement of the main cellular compartments and organelles. For metazoans, extensive changes in cell shape that occur during differentiation or migration are accompanied by organelle repositioning to maintain the functional relationship between organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bornens, 2008</xref>). Thus, the ability of cells to continually adapt and respond to physiological cues requires individual organelles to be relocated. Intracellular organelle organisation is primarily achieved through active transport by motor proteins along cytoskeleton filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barlan &amp; Gelfand, 2017</xref>). The microtubule cytoskeleton, composed of αβ tubulin dimers, is polarised, with the minus-end of microtubules generally located at the centre of the cell, and plus-end located towards the cell periphery. This intrinsic polarity and distinct distribution covering most of the cytoplasm makes the microtubule cytoskeleton ideally suited to orchestrate intracellular bidirectional transport of organelles. This is important for organelle distribution and is mediated by two classes of microtubule motor proteins; minus-end directed dynein and generally plus-end directed kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barlan &amp; Gelfand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bryantseva &amp; Zhapparova, 2012</xref>). Dynein and kinesin motors generate opposing pulling and pushing forces on organelles to maintain their characteristic cellular distribution, often referred to as <italic>tug-of-war</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sweeney &amp; Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Changes in the direction of transport occur when one motor wins over the other, usually in response to cellular and environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barlan &amp; Gelfand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bryantseva &amp; Zhapparova, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Monzon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Different tubulin isoforms, association with various microtubule associated proteins and tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) contribute to the microtubule diversity and create different preferences for molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Janke &amp; Magiera, 2020</xref>). Microtubules undergo numerous PTMs, including detyrosination, acetylation, phosphorylation, palmitoylation, polyglutamylation and polyglycylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Janke &amp; Magiera, 2020</xref>). Different tubulin isoforms and associated carboxy-terminal tail PTMs, have been shown to differentially regulate several molecular motors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sirajuddin <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Moreover, in cells detyrosination and acetylation can affect binding and motility of kinesin-1 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Balabanian <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liao &amp; Gundersen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Reed <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tas <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Thus, microtubule PTMs could play a role in organelle distribution and overall intracellular organization. Consistent with this idea, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distribution is mediated by both tubulin acetylation and glutamylation, which regulates ER-mitochondria interactions and cytoplasm distribution, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Friedman <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, it remains unclear how these PTMs regulate the net distribution of multiple organelles and, in particular, how different organelles respond to the same modifications.</p><p id="P5">The centrosome, which is the main microtubule organizing centre in somatic cells, occupies a very characteristic position at the cell centre and in close contact with the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bornens, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2008</xref>). This close contact requires the interaction between centrosomal microtubules and the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, composed of nesprins and SUN proteins, at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gundersen &amp; Worman, 2013</xref>). In addition, centrosome position at cell's centroid is actively maintained by the radial distribution of microtubules and dynein pulling forces and also responds to anisotropic distribution of the actin network, particularly in enucleated cells (cytoplasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burakov <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jimenez <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Koonce <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Centrosome aberrations, such as centrosome amplification, can be found in cancer cells and play direct roles in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Goundiam &amp; Basto, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nigg &amp; Holland, 2018</xref>). Centrosome amplification can directly promote cell invasion, in part by increased microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Godinho <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), however how these changes impact microtubule cytoskeleton and centrosome localization remains largely unknown.</p><p id="P6">In this study we discovered that inducing centrosome amplification leads to a global change in the distribution of intracellular compartments towards the cell periphery, which requires kinesin-1, suggesting it results from an imbalance of forces that favours plus-end directed motors. Cells with amplified centrosomes display increased tubulin acetylation, a known microtubule PTM involved in favouring kinesin-1 mediated motility. Systematic analyses of several intracellular compartments revealed that changes in acetylated tubulin levels differentially impacts intracellular organisation in cells. In particular, increased tubulin acetylation displaces centrosomes, mitochondria and vimentin away from the nucleus. Consistent with vimentin displacement towards cell periphery, cells with amplified centrosomes have increased nuclear deformability and migrate more proficiently through small pores. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that tubulin acetylation differentially regulates the positioning of individual intracellular cell compartments and that intracellular reorganisation could facilitate invasion in cells with amplified centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Centrosome amplification leads to kinesin-1 mediated centrosome displacement</title><p id="P7">In interphase cells, centrosomes localize in close proximity to the nucleus, with an average 1-2 μm distance in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rezaul <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that induction of centrosome amplification by transiently overexpressing Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arnandis <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV 1A,B</xref>), led to a displacement of clustered centrosomes away from the nucleus and towards cell periphery (∼1.7 fold) in RPE-1 cells (RPE-1.iPLK4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A,B</xref>). This phenotype is unlikely due to unspecific effects of DOX treatment or PLK4 overexpression since overexpression of a catalytically active PLK4 truncation mutant that does not induce centrosome amplification, PLK4<sup>1-608</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guderian <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), did not lead to centrosome displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). To test if increasing cell polarization further exacerbated this phenotype, RPE-1.iPLK4 cells were embedded in a 3D collagen-I matrix that promotes cell polarization. Indeed, the distance between extra centrosomes and the nucleus was further enhanced in cells plated in 3D (∼4.1 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C,D</xref>). These results indicate that increasing centrosome numbers is sufficient to displace centrosomes away from the nucleus.</p><p id="P8">Microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole led to a small increase in centrosome-nucleus distance, which is consistent with loss of centrosome-nucleus attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Salpingidou <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, no further increase was observed in cells with amplified centrosomes, suggesting that microtubules play a key role in this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1C,D</xref>). By contrast, latrunculin-A-mediated F-actin depolymerization did not alter centrosome-nucleus distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1C,D</xref>). Organelle positioning is often dictated by a balance of forces mediated by minus-end directed dynein and plus-end directed kinesin-1 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Belyy <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hancock, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether the displacement of centrosomes towards the cell periphery was due to imbalanced forces that favored kinesin-1. To test this, we depleted the ubiquitously expressed kinesin-1 Kinesin Family Member 5B (KIF5B) by siRNA in cells plated in 3D collagen-I matrices. We found that upon KIF5B depletion, supernumerary centrosomes remained closely associated with the nucleus, suggesting that pushing forces on the centrosomes are mediated by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV1E</xref>). Consistent with dynein's role in counteracting kinesin-1 pushing forces to maintain centrosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Splinter <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stiff <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), inhibition of dynein by depleting the p150<sup>glued</sup> subunit of the dynactin complex led to similar centrosome displacement in control cells. However, depletion of p150<sup>glued</sup> had no impact on centrosome displacement in cells with amplified centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV1E</xref>). To further evaluate if an imbalance of forces was responsible for centrosome displacement, we disrupted the interaction between centrosomal microtubules and the nuclear envelope to assess displacement in conditions where centrosomes were not constrained by its interaction with the nucleus. To do so, a dominant-negative KASH domain of nesprin-2 (<sup>GFP</sup>KASH2) that prevents the interaction of nesprins with the SUN proteins was overexpressed in RPE-1.iPLK4 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1F,G</xref>). Overexpression of <sup>GFP</sup>KASH-DL, which does not disrupt MTs association with the nuclear envelope, was used as control. We postulated that if cells with amplified centrosomes have increased kinesin-1 pushing forces, we would observe greater centrosome displacement towards the leading edge when centrosomal microtubules are not anchored to the nuclear envelope. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Luxton <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), <sup>GFP</sup>KASH2 overexpression led to centrosome displacement in control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1H,I</xref>). Strikingly, once centrosomes were not constrained by their interaction with the nuclear envelope, a greater displacement towards the cell periphery was observed in cells with amplified centrosomes (∼4.5 fold) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV 1H,I</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that unbalanced forces that favor kinesin-1 mediates centrosome displacement in cells with amplified centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Centrosome amplification leads to global intracellular reorganization</title><p id="P9">Since other organelles and cellular components rely on dynein-kinesin balance for their positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barlan &amp; Gelfand, 2017</xref>), we next investigated if centrosome amplification played a global role in organelle positioning in cells plated in 2D and 3D collagen-I matrices. Using the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) marker, we assessed the distribution of early endosomes in cells with normal (-DOX) and amplified (+DOX) centrosomes. Indeed, similar to centrosomes, the distance between the nucleus and endosomes increased in cells with amplified centrosomes, but not in cells overexpressing PLK4<sup>1-608</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A-C</xref>), indicating a dispersion towards the cell periphery similar to p150<sup>glued</sup> depletion in control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Marchesin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV2A</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of KIF5B in cells with amplified centrosomes resulted in endosomes repositioning near the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV2A</xref>). Because the intermediate filament vimentin also relies on kinesin-1 to be transported towards the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gyoeva &amp; Gelfand, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leduc &amp; Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liao &amp; Gundersen, 1998</xref>), we assessed its distribution ratio, where a ratio&gt;1 indicates a dispersal towards the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leduc &amp; Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>). While in control cells (-DOX) and in cells overexpressing PLK4<sup>1-608</sup> vimentin remains mostly around the nucleus, in cells with amplified centrosomes (+DOX), vimentin is displaced to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F-H</xref>). Dispersion of vimentin in these cells also required KIF5B, and depletion of p150<sup>glued</sup> caused a similar displacement in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2I,J</xref>). Additionally, we observed that both the mitochondria (labelled with MitoTracker) and the Golgi (using GM130 as marker) were also displaced in cells with amplified centrosomes in 2D and 3D cultures, but not in cells overexpressing PLK4<sup>1-608</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2B-I</xref>). Interestingly, nucleus-centrosome distance seems to be most sensitive to increased cell polarization and augmented organelle displacement was not always observed in highly polarized cells plated in 3D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2J</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate an unprecedented role for centrosome amplification in organelle organization, a process that is dependent on the kinesin-1 KIF5B.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cells with extra centrosomes exhibit increased tubulin acetylation levels</title><p id="P10">Tubulin acetylation has been shown to positively influence kinesin-1 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Reed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Thus, we tested whether organelle displacement observed in cells with amplified centrosomes was driven by changes in tubulin acetylation. We first assessed the levels of tubulin acetylation by immunofluorescence in single cells and found that cells with extra centrosomes have a ∼2 fold increase in tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A,B</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of PLK4<sup>1-608</sup> had no impact on the levels of tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV3A</xref>). Cells with amplified centrosomes showed a marked increase in tubulin acetylation levels throughout the cell and near the leading edge compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV3B</xref>). Tubulin acetylation has been previously associated with long-lived nocodazole-resistant microtubules and proposed to protect microtubules against mechanical ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Portran <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). We found that cells with extra centrosomes retain a significantly increased population of nocodazole-resistant that are acetylated, suggesting that increase tubulin acetylation could be a consequence of microtubule stabilization in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3I,J</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To understand the source of increased tubulin acetylation in cells with extra centrosomes, we first assessed the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have previously shown that cells with amplified centrosomes have increased levels of intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arnandis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and it has been recently demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can damage the microtubule lattice, resulting in increased tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goldblum <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We confirmed that RPE-1.iPLK4 cells with extra centrosomes (+DOX) displayed higher ROS levels, which can be blocked by treating cells with the broad NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV3E,F</xref>). Interestingly, blocking ROS production in cells with amplified centrosomes did not prevent increased tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E,F</xref>). Because centrosome amplification can enhance microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Godinho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), we next tested if increased total tubulin could account for the higher levels of acetylated tubulin in these cells. Quantification of α-tubulin immunofluorescence intensity demonstrated that the presence of extra centrosomes leads to increased total tubulin in steady-state cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref>). Normalising tubulin acetylation to total tubulin almost completely equalized the ratio of acetylated tubulin in cells with and without amplified centrosomes, although small differences can still be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3H</xref>). Could the increased tubulin levels be a consequence of microtubule stabilization? This is unlikely to be the case since acute H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment increased acetylated tubulin levels without affecting total tubulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F-H</xref>). These results demonstrate that cells with extra centrosomes have increased acetylated microtubules at least in part due to higher levels of total tubulin. It is possible that in addition to damaged sites, microtubule nucleation sites, such as centrosomes, could provide an opportunity for αTAT1 to access the microtubule lumen where α-tubulin gets acetylated. This could provide an explanation for both the accumulation of acetylated tubulin around the centrosome and its increase in response to increased microtubule nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Acetylated tubulin differentially regulates intracellular reorganization</title><p id="P12">We next assessed whether tubulin acetylation is involved in the displacement of intracellular compartments by targeting the main tubulin acetyltransferase in mammalian cells, αTAT1, which acetylates lysine 40 (K40) on α?tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shida <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Using two independent siRNAs (#5 and #9) against αTAT1, we greatly reduced the levels of αTAT1 mRNA and acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV4A,B</xref>). Depletion of αTAT1 rescued centrosome displacement in cells with amplified centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A,B</xref>). Similarly, vimentin and mitochondria displacement towards the cell periphery were also supressed following αTAT1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C-F</xref>). However, not all membrane-bound organelles displaced in cells with amplified centrosomes were sensitive to the levels of tubulin acetylation. EEA1-positive endosomes and Golgi displacement were not prevented by αTAT1 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV4C-F</xref>), indicating that displacement of these organelles in response to centrosome amplification is regulated by a different mechanism that does not involve tubulin acetylation. Moreover, αTAT1 depletion did not prevent the formation of stable, nocodazole-resistant microtubules in cells with amplified centrosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV4G,H</xref>), thus the role of tubulin acetylation in kinesin-1 mediated organelle displacement is independent of increased microtubule stabilization.</p><p id="P13">To test if microtubule acetylation was sufficient to promote intracellular reorganization, we treated cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which led to similar levels of tubulin acetylation observed in cells with amplified centrosomes but did not change total tubulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F,G</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells displayed increased centrosome and vimentin displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A-D</xref>), but no effect was observed on endosome displacement or Golgi dispersion, even in cells that exhibited centrosome displacement, further demonstrating that these phenotypes are not co-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV5A-C</xref>). Because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment induces mitochondria fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fan <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), we were unable to assess mitochondria displacement in this condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV5D</xref>). Additionally, we tested whether inducing higher levels of tubulin acetylation by treating cells with Tubacin, an inhibitor of the deacetylase HDAC6, or by overexpressing αTAT1 could induce similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV5E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Haggarty <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Indeed, cells treated with tubacin or overexpressing αTAT1 (αTAT1 OE) showed vimentin and mitochondria displacement towards cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E-H</xref>). Surprisingly, however, centrosomes remained closely associated with the nuclear envelope, suggesting that high levels of tubulin acetylation alone may not be sufficient to promote their displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV5D</xref>). What could explain this difference? We hypothesised that in addition to increased levels, the distribution or orientation of acetylated microtubules could differentially impact centrosome positioning, since as a single organelle it would be more sensitive to the polarisation of pushing forces, where isotropic pushing forces would cancel each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). To assess this, we divided the cell as rear and front based on the centrosome positioning and quantified the distribution of orientation variations using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schindelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B,C</xref>). Plotting the raw values for the frequency of all orientation variations in the cell front (values &gt;0) and rear (values &lt;0), as well as the normalised orientation values, suggested that the distribution of acetylated microtubules is different between conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV6A,B</xref>). Polarisation of orientation variations towards the leading edge can be readily visualised in the rose plots, where a slight increase in polarisation can be observed in cells with amplified centrosomes (+DOX) and those treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, this analysis does not take into account the balance of tubulin acetylation between front:rear of the cell. To try to assess this, for each orientation variation, we subtracted the rear frequency from the front frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). We found that firstly, it is clear that in all conditions there is an increase in the frequency of orientations towards the front of the cell; and secondly that a clear polarisation of these frequencies towards the leading edge (∼60<sup>0</sup> to 120<sup>0</sup>) can be observed in cells with amplified centrosomes or treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, and assuming that increased frequency oftubulin acetylation results in increased kinesin-1 pushing forces, our data could explain why centrosome displacement is only observed in cells with extra centrosomes or treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> since only in these conditions our model predicts directional forces towards leading edge. These results demonstrate that the displacement of centrosomes, vimentin and mitochondria towards the leading edge is regulated by tubulin acetylation and that both levels and distribution of acetylated microtubules could differentially impact these phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Intracellular reorganization in cells with amplified centrosomes correlates with enhanced nuclear deformability</title><p id="P14">Nucleus-associated vimentin confers a protective role to the nucleus against mechanical stress and its loss enhances nuclear deformability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Patteson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Patteson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019b</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that intracellular reorganization resulting in vimentin displacement towards the cell periphery could promote nuclear deformability. Nucleus aspect ratio was used as proxy for deformability, where 1=perfect circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). When plated in 3D confined collagen-I matrices, cells with amplified centrosomes displayed lower nuclear circularity compared to control cells, suggesting increased nuclear deformability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B,C</xref>). Although actin has long been proposed to play a role in mediating nucleus deformation in different cells types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Thiam <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), treatment with latrunculin-A did not prevent nuclear deformability in cells with amplified centrosomes. By contrast, microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole prevented nuclear deformability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV7A,B</xref>). Moreover, KIF5B depletion also blocked increased nuclear deformability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B,C</xref>). Similarly to what was observed for organelle displacement, p150<sup>glued</sup> depletion did not impact cells with extra centrosomes but was sufficient to increase nuclear deformability in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B,C</xref>). These results support a model where changes in the balance of microtubule motor protein activity driven by centrosome amplification enhances nuclear deformability, likely as a result of vimentin displacement towards the cell leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">During cell migration through confined spaces, the nucleus, which is the largest and stiffest cellular organelle, constitutes a burden for cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Denais <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Raab <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the increased nuclear deformability in cells with amplified centrosomes could facilitate migration through confined spaces. To test this, we utilized a Transwell assay in which cells were seeded onto a membrane and allowed to migrate through pores of different sizes. Using RPE-1.iPLK4 cells expressing H2B-GFP to visualize the nucleus, the speed of nuclear translocation through these pores was assessed by live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). We found that the time for the nucleus to cross the larger 8µm pores was similar in cells with normal and amplified centrosomes (-DOX=97.01 ± 5.779min; +DOX= 97.07 ± 6.41min). However, cells with amplified centrosomes migrated faster through smaller 5µm pores (-DOX=123.4 ± 7.345min; +DOX= 92.74 ± 5.77min), suggesting that increased nuclear deformability provides an advantage in constrained environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E,F</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that changes in organelle organization in cells with extra centrosomes, could enhance nuclear deformation to facilitate migration through confined spaces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Here, we demonstrate that centrosome amplification is sufficient to change intracellular organisation, a process that requires kinesin-1 mediated transport and partly regulated by increased tubulin acetylation. This intracellular reorganisation in cells with amplified centrosomes increases nuclear deformability and facilitates nuclear migration through small constrictions. The differential impact of acetylated tubulin on organelle distribution highlights more complex sensing and response mechanisms by which organelles read the tubulin code.</p><p id="P17">The centrosome positioning at the cell center and in close proximity to the nucleus has long been proposed to result from an equilibrium of pulling and pushing forces exerted by microtubule motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bornens, 2008</xref>). In late G2, Inhibition of dynein leads to centrosome displacement away from the nucleus in a kinesin-1-dependent manner, from the cell center towards cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Splinter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), demonstrating that dynein functions as a brake that counteracts kinesin-1 forces. Interestingly, we found that induction of centrosome amplification is sufficient to drive the displacement of centrosomes towards cell periphery, phenocopying what has been observed in cells upon dynein inhibition. Depletion of the kinesin-1 KIF5B prevents displacement of the centrosomes, implying that pushing forces on centrosomes are mediated by KIF5B and that these forces overcome the pulling activity of dynein. Supporting this idea, disconnecting centrosomal microtubules from the nuclear envelope by disrupting the LINC complex further exacerbates centrosome displacement in cells with amplified centrosomes. We also observed that, in response to centrosome amplification, several intracellular compartments are displaced towards the cell periphery, namely endosomes, mitochondria, vimentin and Golgi. This global reorganization is consistent with previous observations in pancreatic cancer cells showing that centrosome amplification leads to the dispersion of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies towards the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Displacement of endosomes and vimentin have also been shown to require kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gyoeva &amp; Gelfand, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liao &amp; Gundersen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nath <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), potentially highlighting a kinesin-1 mediated global reorganization of the cytoplasm in cells with amplified centrosomes.</p><p id="P18">Systematic analyses of different intracellular compartments revealed that reduction of acetylated tubulin levels, via depletion of αTAT1, prevented the displacement of centrosomes, vimentin and mitochondria towards cell periphery, indicating that enhanced tubulin acetylation plays a role in the relocation of these intracellular compartments. By contrast, depletion of αTAT1 had no significant impact on endosomes and Golgi reorganization, suggesting that other microtubule PTMs and/or adaptor proteins, which link organelles to microtubules, could specifically affect relocation of these organelles in cells with amplified centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Akhmanova &amp; Hammer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barlan &amp; Gelfand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cross &amp; Dodding, 2019</xref>). It is also possible that other kinesin motors, such as kinesin-3, could transport endosomes independently of tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bielska <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wedlich-Soldner <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Exactly how tubulin acetylation, which occurs in the microtubule lumen, favors kinesin-1 mediated organelle transport remains unclear. Our data demonstrates that microtubule stabilization is unlikely to be the answer since αTAT1 depletion in cells with amplified centrosomes does not affect the number of nocodazole-resistant microtubules. Therefore, microtubule stabilization is unlikely to play a role in kinesin-1 mediated displacement of centrosomes, vimentin and mitochondria.</p><p id="P19">Unexpectedly, we found that not only the levels but also the distribution of acetylated microtubules could contribute to organelle displacement. High levels of tubulin acetylation induced by Tubacin or αTAT1 overexpression induced the displacement of vimentin and mitochondria towards cell periphery, but not centrosomes. This contrasts with what was observed in cells with amplified centrosomes or treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which induce lower levels of tubulin acetylation. We propose that an anisotropic distribution of forces is required to displace centrosomes. Indeed, we observed a polarized distribution of acetylated microtubules towards the leading edge in cells harboring amplified centrosomes or treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, suggestive of anisotropic distribution of kinesin-1-mediated pushing forces required for centrosome displacement. While our data is only suggestive of such model, it raises an important issue when assessing the role of microtubule PTMs in cells, that not all conditions that increase specific PTMs may elicit the exact same phenotype and that distribution of modified microtubules should be taken into consideration.</p><p id="P20">What are the consequences of this intracellular reorganization in cells with amplified centrosomes? Extensive changes in cell shape occur as cells migrate, and this is accompanied by relocations of several organelles and cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bornens, 2008</xref>). It is plausible that during migration, displacement of vimentin towards cell periphery could lead to nuclear deformation to facilitate migration through confined spaces. Consistently, cells with amplified centrosomes display increased nuclear deformability in confined 3D collagen gels and move faster through smaller pores. Extreme nuclear deformability has also been observed in invasive MCF10A cells with extra centrosomes migrating through thin invasive protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Godinho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Thus, it is tantalizing to propose that vimentin displacement, rather than loss, could help migration through confined spaces in a more controlled manner while preventing extensive nuclear rupture and DNA damage observed in vimentin knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Patteson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">It has been recently proposed that binding of the ER to glutamylated microtubules plays a role in orchestrating the movement and positioning of several organelles, in an attempt to centralize intracellular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, this is unlikely to be a general feature. While ER tubules were shown to slide preferentially along acetylated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Friedman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), our findings demonstrate that not all organelles respond to tubulin acetylation. This indicates that, depending on the context, individual organelles must have their own sensing and response mechanisms to ensure fine-tuning of their distribution in cells. We propose that this fine-tuning enables cells to adapt to different stimuli and environments.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P22">RPE-1 (human retinal epithelial) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Gibco) and 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S; Gibco) and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 atmosphere.

For all imaging experiments, cells were imaged with an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 Zyla 4.2 camera (Ti-E, Zyla; Andor), including a Yokogawa Spinning Disk, a precision motorized stage, and Nikon Perfect Focus, all controlled by NIS-Elements Software (Nikon). 60× 1.45-NA oil objective was used to acquire images.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Acetylated microtubule orientation variations</title><p id="P33">Images for -DOX, +DOX, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and αTAT1 overexpression were collected using an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 Zyla 4.2 camera (Ti-E, Zyla; Andor) and tubacin images were collected using an LSM 880 point-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images of individual cells were transformed in Fiji to have all cells aligned horizontally, with the leading edge on the right and cell rear on the left. Using the acetylated tubulin signal as a mask, the orientations of acetylated microtubules was calculated using the OrientationJ plugin for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Puspoki <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rezakhaniha <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) for the front of the cell (as defined by the centrosome to the leading edge) and the cell rear (defined as the centrosome to the rear of the cell). The front and rear frequencies were summed to calculate the total frequency of all orientations and used to normalize the data for each cell. The difference between front and rear orientation frequency was calculated by subtracting the rear frequency from the front frequency for each orientation.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantification by live-cell imaging</title><p id="P34">To measure ROS levels in live cells, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells (-DOX and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells (+DOX and +DOX +Apocynin) were seeded overnight in 8-well glass bottom chambers (iBidi). On the following day, cells were washed with 1x PBS twice and incubated for 20 min in dark at 37°C with 20 µM of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; I36007, Thermo Fisher) diluted in serum-free medium. After incubation with H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA, cells were incubated for 5 min in the dark at 37°C with Hoechst 33342 diluted 1:10000 in full growth medium. Wells were then washed with 1x PBS twice and 300 µl of growth medium was added per well. Cells stained with carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA were immediately imaged on an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 Zyla 4.2 camera (Ti-E, Zyla; Andor), including a Yokogawa Spinning Disk, a precision motorized stage, and Nikon Perfect Focus, all controlled by NIS-Elements Software (Nikon). The microscope was enclosed within temperature- and CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled environments that maintained an atmosphere of 37°C and 5% humidified CO<sub>2</sub> for live-cell imaging. 60× 1.45-NA oil objective was used to capture images at multiple fields (∼15 fields) z-stack images were captured with 0.5 μm step size and the step size was calculated to minimal pixel overlapping between steps. This procedure was repeated for each condition. ‘nd’ files containing z-stack images were directly opened in the Fiji software. SUM projection was applied to obtain a 2D image and fluorescence intensity was quantified per cell per field. Raw integrated density of multiple cells was measured. To obtain mean total fluorescence intensity per cell in a field, the total fluorescence intensity was divided by the total number of cells per field. 5-10 fields were analyzed to have a total number of ∼30 cells per condition for each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Quantification of acetylated tubulin</title><p id="P35">‘nd’ files containing z-stack images were directly opened in the Fiji software. SUM projection was applied to obtain a 2D image. To quantify total fluorescent intensity of single cells, the boundaries of single cells within an image were outlined using the ‘freehand’ selection tool in the Fiji software. By using the ‘measure’ command, raw integrated density, mean and area of a single cell were measured. After that, a region without fluorescence outside the cell (background) was outlined and measured to obtain mean background fluorescence. Background-corrected total fluorescence intensity of a single cell was determined using the formula = Raw integrated density - (Area of selected cells × Mean fluorescence of background reading).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Quantification of nocodazole resistant microtubules</title><p id="P36">To quantify the number of microtubules that resist nocodazole treatment we followed a previously published protocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Briefly, cells were plated on glass coverslips overnight. The following day cells were treated with 2 μM of nocodazole in growth medium at 37°C for 30 min. Coverslips were then washed in the extraction buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.0) by rinsing quickly. To extract soluble tubulin, coverslips were immersed in the same extraction buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 μM of nocodazole for 1 min at room temperature. Cells were quickly fixed in cold methanol at -20°C for 10 min. Next, normal immunofluorescence protocol to stained for microtubules, acetylated tubulin and DNA was applied. Cells were imaged using an inverted Zeiss LS880 confocal and a 60x objective. Number of microtubules were quantified manually in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Transwell migration assay</title><p id="P37">RPE-1 cells stably expressing H2B-GFP were grown on transwell chambers (iBidi). Briefly, the bottom of the upper chamber is a cell-permeable membrane with 5µm or 8µm diameter pore size holes allowing cells to migrate through the chamber. Cell-permeable membrane was coated on their external side, where cells attach, with 20µg/mL fibronectin and 10µg/mL fluorescent conjugated fibronectin solution. Cells were cultured in the upper chamber in serum-free medium while serum-containing medium was added to the wells that function as an attractant to cells, allowing efficient cell migration through the pores. Transwells were imaged for 12-16 hr on an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 Zyla 4.2 camera (Ti-E, Zyla; Andor), including a Yokogawa Spinning Disk, a precision motorized stage, and Nikon Perfect Focus, all controlled by NIS-Elements Software (Nikon). The microscope was enclosed within temperature- and CO2-controlled environments that maintained an atmosphere of 37°C and 5% humidified CO2 for live-cell imaging.
