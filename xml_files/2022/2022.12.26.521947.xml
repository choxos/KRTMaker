Left-right asymmetry is established by a leftward flow in the node that results in the asymmetric expression of <italic>Nodal</italic>. This triggers a cascade of asymmetric expression of downstream genes, such as <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, in the lateral plate mesoderm that gives rise to the first morphologically recognizable primordial heart structure, the cardiac crescent. Relatively little is known about gene expression asymmetries in the cardiac crescent that might underpin asymmetric cardiac morphogenesis. To systematically identify asymmetrically expressed genes, we performed a single-cell transcriptional analysis of manually dissected left and right halves of the cardiac crescent at stages spanning symmetry breaking. This revealed both left and right-sided genes that have not previously been implicated in left-right symmetry breaking. Some of these were expressed in multiple cell types but showed asymmetric expression in only a sub-set of cell types. We validated these findings using multiplexed <italic>in situ</italic> Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) and high-resolution volume imaging to characterize the expression patterns of select genes. Using <italic>Dnah<sup>iv/iv</sup></italic> mutant embryos that show randomized situs, we established that all the genes tested tracked the asymmetric expression of <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, indicating their asymmetric expression also arose from the early asymmetries at the node. This study provides a high-fidelity molecular characterization of left-right symmetry breaking during cardiac crescent formation, providing a basis for future mechanistic studies on asymmetric cardiac morphogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P10">The vertebrate body plan is asymmetric, with most internal organs being asymmetrically shaped and positioned along the left-right (LR) body axis. These differences arise due to the regulation of several conserved genes early in development, around embryonic day (E) 7.5. Early bilateral symmetry breaking is initiated by the node<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The node is comprised of ciliated cells, which generate a leftward fluid flow that leads to the asymmetric activation of <italic>Nodal</italic>, a TGFβ growth factor, in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Transient activation of <italic>Nodal</italic> results in the induction of transcription factors <italic>Lefty</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>, which play a fundamental role in governing asymmetric organ morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Of the different <italic>Pitx2</italic> isoforms, it is the <italic>Pitx2c</italic> isoform that is asymmetrically expressed and, in contrast to transient <italic>Nodal</italic> expression, is maintained asymmetrically throughout organogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>Pitx2c</italic> is the main cardiac isoform and is dynamically expressed during heart formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Heart formation is an excellent model to investigate LR differences as it is the first organ to form and function as well as display morphological asymmetries around E8.25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In humans, defects in left-right asymmetry patterning lead to a range of congenital heart defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In the mouse, the heart initially forms as a symmetrical arc of cells, termed the cardiac crescent (CC), at around 7.75dpc before transitioning into the linear heart tube (LHT) which undergoes rightward looping prior to the formation of the four-chambered heart. The process of rightward looping and generation of a helical shape are modulated by <italic>Nodal</italic> at the poles of the LHT, which regulate proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Detailed morphological analysis and modeling of CC to LHT development has revealed that LR symmetry breaking can already be observed prior to rightward looping of the LHT, with LR differences detected in the orientation of the inflow tracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Whilst the morphological differences during heart looping have been well characterized, the early molecular basis is still relatively unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to explore the temporal dynamics of LR molecular differences at the single-cell whole transcriptome level during cardiac crescent development and the onset of embryo wide symmetry breaking. To do this we exploited a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of the developing cardiac crescent that we had previously generated, in which we collected cells separately from the left and right cardiac regions. This dataset covers the period of development in which LR symmetry breaking is first established and allows the identification of novel asymmetrically expressed genes, thereby expanding our molecular understanding of how asymmetries arise in the forming embryo.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identifying genes expressed asymmetrically in the forming cardiac crescent</title><p id="P13">Previously, we generated an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic dataset of the developing mouse heart, from emergence of the cardiac crescent to the formation of the linear heart tube, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/heartAtlas/">https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/heartAtlas/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We identified twelve different cell populations, from all three germ layers. These included mesodermal cell types (cardiac progenitors, cardiomyocytes, endothelial and blood populations), overlying endoderm (including definitive and yolk sac) and adjacent ectoderm (representing surface/amnion and neuroectoderm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To discover left-right asymmetrically expressed genes, we manually dissected cells from the left or right sides of the embryos during the collection of cells from the cardiac crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, these data provide a highly time-resolved resource to investigate asymmetrically expressed genes during the onset of left-right asymmetry in the heart. Across the four stages of cardiac crescent development profiled, we generated high-quality transcriptomes for roughly equal numbers of cells from the left and right sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Most of the twelve cell subpopulations also had equal representation of cells from both sides, and these intermingled in the UMAP representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a</xref>). To confirm our dissection and faithful separation of the left and right cardiac crescent regions, we first examined the well-known asymmetrically expressed genes <italic>Nodal</italic>, <italic>Lefty</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These three genes were predominantly expressed in the cardiac mesoderm related clusters (Me3-Me8), representing both cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes, and as expected, were expressed at significantly higher levels and in more cells from the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>). Cell cycle analysis showed no difference in the proportion of cells in G2/M, G1 or S-phase between left and right sides of the embryo in cardiomyocytes (Me3), blood (Me1), endothelial cells (Me2), endoderm (En1, En2) and 2) or ectoderm (Ec1, Ec2) although we observed a small but significant reduction of cells in G1 phase from the right side in the cardiac mesoderm progenitor clusters (Me4-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c, Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To identify novel asymmetrically expressed genes, we used differential expression analysis to test for expression differences between the left and right cells in each cell subpopulation (excluding Me1 and Me2 due to their small number of cells). In the mesodermal cell types, we identified 229 asymmetrically expressed genes, with two thirds expressed at higher levels in the cells from the left side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). As observed before, <italic>Lefty2</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> were among the most significant asymmetrically expressed genes, as well as <italic>Atp1a1</italic> and <italic>Gal</italic>, which has also been reported to be expressed at higher levels in the left side of the embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The endodermal and ectodermal subpopulations showed fewer significant differences (23 and 60 respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a and b, Supplementary Table 2</xref>). There was almost no overlap between the differentially expressed genes identified in each germ layer (only six genes were differentially expressed in the mesoderm clusters that were also differentially expressed in the endoderm (<italic>Eif3b</italic>, <italic>Polr2a</italic>, <italic>Gm13050</italic>) or in the ectoderm (<italic>Gm18821</italic>, <italic>Efhd2</italic>, <italic>Klf6</italic>), and none in all three.</p><p id="P15">The genes with asymmetric left-right expression in cardiac mesoderm cells (Me3-Me8) were expressed in varying patterns across the different clusters.

Interestingly, the genes with expression in the SHF-related clusters showed significantly larger fold-changes and smaller p-values compared to the genes in other clusters.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Validation of asymmetric expression using HCR</title><p id="P16">To experimentally validate the asymmetric expression of these genes, we used multiplexed Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) and confocal volume imaging. We used <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> and <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression as positive controls for symmetrical and asymmetrical cardiac progenitor expression respectively. Multiplexed detection of these controls along with the transcript being tested allowed us to circumvent confounders that may have resulted from dynamic changes in expression patterns of these genes during development within even closely staged multiple samples.</p><p id="P17">To effectively use <italic>Pitx2c</italic> as a control for asymmetric expression, we first performed a detailed time-resolved characterization of its expression during early cardiac development stage mouse embryos. <italic>Pitx2c</italic> is the left specific isoform of <italic>Pitx2</italic> and has previously been reported to be expressed in the heart, gut and LPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To establish when and where asymmetric expression of <italic>Pitx2c</italic> first occurs during cardiac crescent formation, we used whole mount multiplexed in situ HCR, followed by confocal volume imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). This showed that in the majority of late headfold stage embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (stage -1 cardiac crescents) <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was LR symmetrically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) in all tissues (10/12 embryos). <italic>Pitx2c</italic> transcripts were detected in the cranial mesoderm, yolk sac endoderm, paraxial mesoderm and headfold ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a-c</xref>). In a minority of embryos (2/12), <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was detected asymmetrically in a small region of left caudal LPM, closest to the node and furthest from the cardiac crescent. At stage 0, <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression remained symmetrical in the paraxial and cranial mesoderm, headfold ectoderm and yolk sac endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, by this stage, <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was detected asymmetrically in left-sided LPM in a majority of embryos (7/8), either in a small left-sided region of caudal LPM (4/7 embryos) or had begun to spread rostrally throughout the left-sided LPM extending into the maturing cardiac crescent (3/7 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3d-i</xref>). By stage 1, most embryos (29/30) showed left-asymmetric expression throughout the LPM. Symmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression was still maintained in the headfold ectoderm, cranial mesoderm and yolk sac endoderm, but was lost from the paraxial mesoderm below the crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Once the linear heart tube had formed, asymmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression was restricted to the left sinus horn and LPM, whilst symmetric expression was maintained in the headfolds, cranial mesoderm and yolk sac. This reveals that the expression of <italic>Pitx2c</italic> is extremely dynamic over the approximately 10-hour period spanning stages -1 to LHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Next, we selected five left-sided genes identified from the single-cell RNA-seq dataset to test: <italic>Acss1</italic>, <italic>Mmp9</italic>, <italic>Mecom</italic>, <italic>Sema3a</italic> and <italic>Srgap1</italic>. HCR analysis was initially performed on mid cardiac crescent stage (stages 1–3) embryos, when <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was clearly asymmetrically expressed. All the left-sided genes tested showed left-sided asymmetry, but their expression profiles differed. <italic>Acss1</italic>, which encodes a mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme, was predominantly expressed in the left LPM (10/10 stage 1–3 embryos), extending into the cardiac crescent, with diffuse expression throughout this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 and S6a</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Sema3a</italic>, encoding a member of the semaphorin signaling family, and <italic>Srgap1</italic>, encoding the SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase Activating Protein 1, were expressed in both the left and right LPM extending into the cardiac crescent, but in all cases, more strongly on the left (<italic>Sema3a</italic>; 6/6 stage 1–3 embryos, <italic>Srgap1</italic>; 7/8 stage 1–3 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d, 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 and S6a</xref>). <italic>Sema3a</italic> also showed strong symmetrical expression within the headfolds, consistent with its expression in the transcriptional clusters Ec1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6a</xref>).</p><p id="P19"><italic>Mecom</italic>, which encodes the transcription factor EVI1, was identified in two mesodermal clusters, Me2 (endocardium) and Me6 (differentiating cardiac progenitors). <italic>Mecom</italic> was symmetrically expressed in cluster Me2 and asymmetrically expressed in cluster Me6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). HCR validated this and showed strong left-asymmetric expression in the LPM (9/9 stage 1–3 embryos) but symmetrical expression in the forming endocardial cells within the cardiac crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b, 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6a</xref>). <italic>Mmp9</italic>, which encodes a matrix metalloprotease involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, was detected within individual cells in the left limb of the cardiac crescent (12/12 stage 1–3 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d, 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>). At slightly later LHT stages, <italic>Mmp9</italic> continues to be asymmetrically expressed and is downregulated in <italic>Nodal</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The anatomical characterization and validation of left-sided expression of <italic>Acss1</italic>, <italic>Mmp9</italic>, <italic>Mecom</italic>, <italic>Sema3a</italic>, <italic>Srgap1</italic> confirms our single-cell transcriptional approach to identify novel asymmetrically expressed genes.</p><p id="P20">Our computational analysis also revealed right-sided genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f and 1g</xref>), though fewer than left-asymmetric genes. We sought to experimentally validate <italic>Ybx3</italic> and <italic>Eif3b</italic> by HCR. <italic>Ybx3</italic> encodes a DNA- and RNA-binding protein which can regulate transcription and mRNA stability, having a role in proliferation and amino acid uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. <italic>Ybx3</italic> was expressed in all germ layers including all mesoderm cell types, however it showed significantly greater expression in mesodermal cells collected from the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 and S6a</xref>). Whole mount HCR imaging revealed the widespread expression of <italic>Ybx3</italic> in tissues derived from all germ layers. Furthermore in 6/9 embryos, it was expressed more strongly in the right LPM compared to the left, whilst the remaining embryos showed symmetrical (2/9) or left-sided expression (1/9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). We also assessed the right-sided expression of <italic>Eif3b</italic> that encodes the RNA-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex required for protein synthesis initiation. <italic>Eif3b</italic> was strongly expressed in all cell clusters, and this was supported by HCR analysis which revealed strong expression throughout all tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Right-sided <italic>Eif3b</italic> expression was detected in 3 out of 6 embryos, with the remaining embryos displaying left-right symmetrical expression.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Timing of origin of asymmetries in gene expression</title><p id="P21">To address the timing with which asymmetrical expression of these genes manifested during the emergence of left-right asymmetry, we performed HCR at earlier stages. We also measured <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression, to determine whether asymmetric expression of these novel genes preceded or followed that of <italic>Pitx2c</italic>. This revealed that all the markers tested showed asymmetric expression only after <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was upregulated in caudal left-side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>Acss1</italic> was not expressed at all prior to asymmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression. <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression was detected in individual cells located symmetrically on both the left and right sides of the embryo at stages when <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was starting to be expressed asymmetrically in the left LPM. As previously reported, <italic>Mecom</italic> had two different domains of expression. As asymmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression became established, endothelial <italic>Mecom</italic> expression was detected symmetrically but there was no expression in the LPM. At a stage when <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was starting to be expressed asymmetrically in the left LPM, <italic>Srgap1</italic> was expressed symmetrically in the LPM, more rostrally than the asymmetric LPM <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression. At this stage, <italic>Sema3a</italic> was strongly expressed in both the left and right sides of the neural ectoderm as well as the LPM running caudally from the cardiac crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Whilst there was some overlap in the expression of <italic>Sema3a</italic> and <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> at the boundary of the cardiac crescent, <italic>Sema3a</italic> was expressed only at low levels in the cardiac crescent as well as in the cranial and paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Left-right asymmetric gene expression is triggered by events at the node dependent on leftward flow created by the action of nodal cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

During cardiac crescent to LHT maturation there was a shift in the proportion of embryos displaying a given <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). In mutant embryos, the onset of asymmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression was delayed in comparison to that of wild type embryos, with asymmetric expression being detected only from stage 1 onwards. As the cardiac crescent transitioned into the LHT, the proportion of embryos with symmetrical <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression increased, whilst the number of embryos with no <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression decreased.</p><p id="P24">When we looked at <italic>Mecom</italic> expression in these embryos, we observed normal symmetrical expression in the cardiac endothelium in all <italic>iv/iv</italic> mutant embryos irrespective of the expression pattern of <italic>Pitx2c</italic>. In mutant embryos in which <italic>Pitx2c</italic> was expressed asymmetrically in either the right or left LPM, we found that the LPM expression of <italic>Mecom</italic> correlated with the pattern of expression of <italic>Pitx2c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). In embryos where no <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression was detected in the LPM, <italic>Mecom</italic> could only be detected in endothelial cells and was not expressed in LPM, whilst in embryos with symmetrical <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression in the LPM, <italic>Mecom</italic> too was expressed symmetrically in the left and right LPM. Overall, these results indicate that <italic>Mecom</italic> expression in the endothelium and LPM are independently regulated and that the asymmetric LPM expression is determined by the same mechanisms that control asymmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Given the importance of left-right asymmetry in the formation of the body plan, it is fundamental to understand how these asymmetries arise during development. Our study characterizes the molecular differences which are present during symmetry breaking in the mouse embryo, specifically in the context of the embryonic heart, which is the first organ during development to manifest morphological indications of left-right asymmetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Having previously mapped and characterized the cell types present in the anterior heart forming region of the embryo, we used this dataset to identify asymmetrically expressed genes and validated their expression pattern using HCR. Overall left-right transcriptional differences were subtle, having no influence on cell clustering. However, due to our manual sub-dissection, we retained information about whether cells originate on the left or right sides of the cardiac crescent and could leverage this information to identify genes that were expressed with a left or right sided bias. The vast majority of asymmetrically expressed genes were identified within mesodermal cell populations, highlighting germ layer specific responses to symmetry breaking at the node. In contrast to previous attempts at identifying left-right asymmetric gene expression, that identified genes relating predominantly to cardiomyocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the asymmetric genes we have identified and validated play roles in a wide range of biological processes, highlighting the complexity by which asymmetry manifests. These include extracellular matrix remodeling (<italic>Mmp9</italic>), signaling (<italic>Sema3a</italic>), cell cycle progression (<italic>Mecom</italic>) and translation regulation (<italic>Ybx3</italic>). Apart from <italic>Mmp9</italic>, none of these genes have previously been implicated in left-right asymmetry breaking and therefore it would be important to further test and characterize the functional role of these genes in this process. Interestingly, homozygous Evi1 (<italic>Mecom</italic>) knockout mice die at around 10.5dpc. Mutant embryos had widespread hypocellularity and hemorrhaging, and hearts which had a more tube-like appearance, potentially suggesting a looping defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Given our previous high-fidelity mapping of cell types in the cardiac region of the embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we could also validate asymmetric gene expression biases within distinct anatomical locations. For example, <italic>Mmp9</italic> was most strongly expressed in cells from transcriptional clusters Me7, Me6, Me3 and endothelial cells (Me2). Anatomical validation of asymmetric <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression in the embryo showed expression in a specific region of the cardiac crescent which marked the transition from cardiac progenitors to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This anatomical region transcriptionally represented cells from cluster Me6, which strongly expressed <italic>Mmp9</italic>, highlighting how this dataset can identify specific L/R asymmetries in transcriptionally and anatomically distinct populations of cells. Given the role of MMP9 in extracellular matrix remodeling it would suggest that this early asymmetric <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression plays a role in the onset of LHT looping.</p><p id="P28">Our computational analysis revealed several genes with right sided bias, which is striking given that relatively few right-asymmetric genes have been reported in the mouse embryo. Two such examples are <italic>Cerl2</italic>, whose transcripts are stabilized preferentially on the right side of the node; and <italic>Snai1</italic>, expressed more strongly in the right LPM than left<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. When validating right-sided genes using HCR, we found a greater degree of variability in their expression patterns compared to left-sided genes. They did not always show right-sided expression, suggesting potential intrinsic differences in the regulation of right-sided genes compared to the left. This variability could reflect a less-stable, more transient, expression profile for right-sided gene expression relative to the left, which is robustly controlled by the node and downstream <italic>Pitx2c</italic> activation. Alternatively, it could reflect the overall high levels of expression of right sided genes in all cell types, resulting in a technical inability to detect relatively small or localized changes in gene expression levels.</p><p id="P29">One of the most significant right-sided genes was <italic>Ybx3</italic>, which encodes a DNA and RNA binding protein. YBX3 post-translationally controls mRNA stability and translation, having a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and density as well as in amino acid uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Asymmetric proliferation rates have been reported to play a role in driving rightward looping of the LHT, with increased rates of proliferation of the right side of the venous pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Reduction of YBX3 in vitro leads to a decrease in proliferation, potentially highlighting that it may play a role in regulating asymmetric proliferation differences during early cardiac morphogenesis.</p><p id="P30">We have observed the spread of <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression, from a distal region of LPM adjacent to the node, proximally through the LPM and into the cardiac crescent. In contrast we have observed the maintenance of symmetric <italic>Pitx2c</italic> expression in the head folds and yolk sac endoderm, highlighting tissue specific regulation of this gene. Interestingly, we discovered other genes which showed tissue specific asymmetries, such as <italic>Mecom</italic>. Prior to the asymmetric expression of <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, <italic>Mecom</italic> could be detected symmetrically in the endothelial cells of the presumptive endocardium. However, after <italic>Pitx2c</italic> became asymmetric, <italic>Mecom</italic> too became asymmetrically expressed in the LPM, while remaining symmetrically expressed in the endocardium. This highlights differences in the regulation of asymmetric genes within similar anatomical regions but in a cell type specific manner (i.e. endothelial vs. LPM) and could reflect how asymmetric signals propagate from the node but also how these different cell types respond to the asymmetry generating signals. It also indicates that within the heart, different cell types contribute disproportionately to the generation of morphological asymmetries.</p><p id="P31">This study represents a comprehensive transcriptional characterization of asymmetry breaking during cardiac crescent development, in the framework of a single-cell dataset. Given the central role left-right asymmetry plays in cardiac morphogenesis, it provides a valuable resource for further mechanistic studies, aiding in our understanding of congenital heart diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mouse strains, husbandry and embryo collection</title><p id="P32">All animal experiments complied with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, approved by the local Biological Services Ethical Review Process and were performed under UK Home Office project licenses PPL 30/3420 and PCB8EF1B4. To obtain wild-type embryos, C57BL/6 males (in house) were crossed with 8-16 week old CD1 females (Charles River, England). All mice were maintained in a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Noon of the day when a vaginal plug was found was designated E0.5. To dissect the embryos, the pregnant females were culled by cervical dislocation in accordance with schedule one of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. Embryos of the appropriate stage were dissected in M2 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat No. M7167).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Dissection and unbiased collection of cells from the mouse cardiac crescent</title><p id="P33">Following dissection, embryos were collected, keeping the yolk sac intact, in fresh M2 media before being grouped based on their cardiac crescent stage. Progressive crescent stages (-1 to 3) were defined based on morphological criteria including the shape of the cardiac crescent and the ratio between width (medio-lateral axis) and maximum height (rostral-caudal axis) of the crescent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Stage -1 embryos were defined based on the incomplete fusion of the mesodermal wings in the anterior portion of the embryo. Embryos were considered to be at the LHT stage once both sides of the cardiac crescent were completely folded and fused. Embryos prior to cardiac crescent formation were staged using the Lawson and Wilson staging system of mouse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Once embryos were staged, crescent regions were micro-dissected using tungsten needles, keeping the overlying endoderm intact. By maintaining the integrity of the overlying endoderm at cardiac crescent and LHT stages, regions of both yolk sac endoderm and embryonic endoderm were also collected as well as the forming pericardium. To isolate cardiac crescent regions, the anterior half of the embryo was dissected from the posterior before a cut was made along the midline separating the embryo into left and right sides. The cardiac crescent could then be isolated using the sagittal profile to collect both dorsal and ventral tissue. Left and right sides of the sub-dissected regions where disaggregated and processed separately. At LHT stage the heart tube was isolated by dissections from the ventral surface, due to both the morphology and size of the tissue, therefore it is unlikely we collected regions of the dorsal pericardial wall. Following isolation of the cardiac crescent region the tissue was pooled from multiple embryos (Embryos pooled: stage LHT: 5, stage 3; 7, stage 2; 27, stage 1; 18, stage 0; 7, stage -1; 2). The pooled samples were dissociated into single cells using 200μl Accutase (ThermoFisher, Cat No. A1110501) for 12 minutes at 37°C, being agitated every 2 minutes, before adding 200μl heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher, Cat No. 10500) to quench the reaction. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C before being suspended in 100μl HBSS (ThermoFisher, Cat No. 14025) + 1% FBS, and stored on ice. Single cells were collected using a Sony SH800 FACS machine with a stringent single-cell collection protocol and sorted into 384 well plates containing SMART-seq2 lysis buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> plus ERCC spike-ins. To ensure we collected good quality cells, a live/dead dye (Abcam, Cat No. ab115347) was used; 100μl was added to the cell suspension at a 2x concentration in HBSS 10 minutes before collection, and live cells were collected based on their FITC intensity. Once cells were collected, plates were sealed, spun down, and frozen using dry ice before being stored at -80°C. This complete process, from dissection to single-cell collection, took approximately 2-3 hours. Cells were collected in multiple batches.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p id="P35">To identify asymmetrically expressed genes, we used the previously reported data from Tyser et al, 2021, obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://content.cruk.cam.ac.uk/jmlab/mouseEmbryonicHeartAtias/">https://content.cruk.cam.ac.uk/jmlab/mouseEmbryonicHeartAtias/</ext-link>. Briefly, single-cell transcriptomic data for good-quality cells is available in a SingleCellExperiment object (sce_goodQual.NORM.clusters.Rds), containing raw and normalized counts, together with batch, stage, side, and cluster annotations for each cell. This object was the basis for all analyses reported in this study.</p><p id="P36">To test for differential expression between cells from the left and right sides, we converted the SingleCellExperiment object into a DGElist object (convertTo function from scran package (Lun, McCarthy, Marioni, F1000Res, 2016)) to be used with edgeR (Robinson, McCarthy, Smyth, Bioinformatics, 2010). We analyzed each germ layer separately and used generalized linear models to test for differences between left and right sides in cells from each cluster (with glmQLFit and glmQLFTest), while controlling for batch (experiment date). Contrasts for all clusters from the same germ layer were tested together to reduce the number of tests performed; we thus obtained a single p-value indicating whether the gene is differentially expressed in <italic>any</italic> of the clusters tested (Me1 and Me2 were excluded due to their very small number of cells). P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini Hochberg method.</p><p id="P37">To define significant changes in expression, we required a gene to have an adjusted p-value smaller than 0.05 and an absolute fold-change larger than 1.5 for mesoderm clusters, and 1.3 for endoderm and ectoderm clusters. We filtered out genes with unstable fold-changes that stem from outlier expression in a small number of cells. For this, we computed the average gene expression levels in each cluster and ignored fold-change estimates from clusters where gene expression was lower than 1 normalized log2 count. We filtered out any genes that no longer fulfilled the minimum fold-change threshold from our list of significant results. This procedure ensures that the asymmetrically expressed genes defined are supported by at least moderate expression levels in the clusters showing differential expression.
