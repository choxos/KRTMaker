respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PASC). Current evidence suggests a dysregulated alveolar regeneration in COVID-19 as a possible explanation for respiratory PASC symptoms, a phenomenon which deserves further investigation in a suitable animal model. This study investigates morphological, phenotypical and transcriptomic features of alveolar regeneration in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian golden hamsters. We demonstrate that CK8<sup>+</sup> alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells occur following SARS-CoV-2-induced diffuse alveolar damage. A subset of ADI cells shows nuclear accumulation of TP53 at 6- and 14-days post infection (dpi), indicating a prolonged arrest in the ADI state. Transcriptome data show the expression of gene signatures driving ADI cell senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Moreover, we show that multipotent CK14<sup>+</sup> airway basal cell progenitors migrate out of terminal bronchioles, aiding alveolar regeneration. At 14 dpi, presence of ADI cells, peribronchiolar proliferates, M2-type macrophages, and sub-pleural fibrosis is observed, indicating incomplete alveolar restoration. The results demonstrate that the hamster model reliably phenocopies indicators of a dysregulated alveolar regeneration of COVID-19 patients. The results provide important information on a translational COVID-19 model, which is crucial for its application in future research addressing pathomechanisms of PASC and in testing of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for this syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)</kwd><kwd>alveolar regeneration</kwd><kwd>hamster</kwd><kwd>alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cell</kwd><kwd>lung fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused over 600 million infections and over 6.5 million fatal outcomes to this day (October 2022, WHO). Patients surviving acute COVID-19 are at risk to develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. PASC occurs in 3-11.7% of infected individuals and is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, headache, cognitive dysfunction, altered smell and taste, shortness of breath, and dyspnea, occurring &gt;12 weeks after acute virus infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Of note, among patients with severe disease requiring hospitalization, shortness of breath or dyspnea are reported with a much higher frequency (in up to 49% and 23.3% of cases, respectively) 8-10 months after acute disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The pathomorphological correlates and mechanisms responsible for respiratory PASC are still not fully understood. Impairment of gas exchange capacity due to an incomplete or protracted regeneration of alveoli and lung fibrosis represent potential pathomechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung causes diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), characterized by necrosis of alveolar epithelial type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) cells, fibrin exudation and edema, followed by alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in later stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The healing of damaged alveoli and recovery of gas exchange capacity requires the presence of progenitor cells that are able to regenerate lost AT1 cells. For a long time, it was assumed that AT1 cells are regenerated solely by proliferating and trans-differentiating AT2 cells. However, recent advances in mouse models of lung injury have shown that different airway progenitor cell types expand and mobilize to repair alveolar structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. AT2 cells are mainly responsible for AT1 cell regeneration in homeostatic turnover and following mild injury, while airway progenitors are recruited after severe injury with marked AT1 cell loss <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The differentiation into mature AT1 cells features an intermediate step, the so-called <italic>alveolar differentiation intermediate</italic> (ADI) cell, first described to occur during AT2 to AT1 cell trans-differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. ADI cells in mice are characterized by cytokeratin 8 (CK8) expression, a polygonal to elongated morphology, NFκB and TP53 activation and upregulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), HIF-1α pathway, and cell cycle exit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. ADI cells have been observed in various lung injury models, e.g. bleomycin injury, neonatal hypoxia and hyperoxia, LPS injury and Influenza A virus infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In homeostatic turnover and mild injury, these cells occur only transiently and differentiate into mature AT1 cells eventually, thereby restoring normal alveolar structure and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, a pathological accumulation of ADI cellshas been observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in humans and a mouse model for progressive fibrosis, suggesting that a blockage during trans-differentiation of ADI to AT1 cells could represent a potential regenerative defect in these conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, high numbers of ADI cells have also been demonstrated in lungs of COVID-19 patients. It has been postulated that persistence of these cells could be responsible for unremitting hypoxemia, edema, ventilator dependence and the fatal outcome in protracted ARDS as well as the subsequent development of fibrosis in PASC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Since serial samples are rarely available in human observational studies, the fate of COVID-19 associated ADI cells remains elusive. Addressing this open question is of paramount importance to obtain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the protracted recovery from COVID-19 facilitating the development of rational therapeutic approaches in the field of lung regenerative medicine. The development of a precise working hypothesis and subsequent preclinical testing of therapeutic options requires the study of sequential phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in appropriate animal models. Among the susceptible small animal species, Syrian golden hamsters <italic>(Mesocricetus auratus)</italic> are well suited to study regenerative responses. They develop a distinct, but transient and non-lethal disease, in contrast to other models such as transgenic mice or ferrets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The regeneration of lung epithelia following SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been characterized in detail in this important animal model yet. To obtain further insights in the regenerative processes following SARS-CoV-2 infection we characterized the proliferating epithelial cells within the lung of infected hamsters in the acute and sub-acute phase of the infection until 14 days post infection. Our study shows that CK8<sup>+</sup>ADI cells and multipotent CK14<sup>+</sup> airway basal cells participate in alveolar regeneration and that persistence of ADI cells at 14 dpi is associated with fibrosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. In addition our study provides a hamster-specific marker gene lists for different alveolar cell populations, including AT1, ADI and AT2 cells. Altogether, the results provide important information on a translational COVID-19 model, which is crucial for its application in future research addressing pathomechanisms of PASC and for testing of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for this syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>1</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 induced epithelial proliferative responses and inflammation persist beyond virus clearance</title><p id="P5">First, successful infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) antigen in lung tissue. Viral antigen was found in alveolar and bronchial epithelia as well as in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Quantification of immunolabeled cells in whole lung sections peaked at 3 dpi, followed by a sharp decline at 6 dpi and virus clearance at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). No SARS-CoV-2<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in mock-infected animals at any time point. Histologically, SARS-CoV-2 infected animals showed a marked, transient, broncho-interstitial pneumonia, as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The lesions were characterized by DAD with epithelial cell degeneration and necrosis, sloughing of alveolar cells, fibrin exudation and heterophilic and histiocytic infiltrates. Some mock-infected animals showed small foci of mild, multifocal, interstitial inflammation composed of heterophils and macrophages, particularly at 1 dpi. The extent of inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 and mock infected animals was quantified in total lung sections using whole slide digital image analysis of Iba-1 immunolabeling. The number of Iba-1<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to the mock group at 1, 3, and 6, with a notable peak at 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The inflammatory lesions in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters were accompanied by a prominent epithelial proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). At 3 dpi, small foci of hyperplastic epithelial cells were observed within alveoli in single animals, affecting up to 1.3% of the examined lung area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). At 6 dpi, large areas of prominent epithelial cell proliferation were found in all infected animals, affecting 9.3% to 39.3% of the examined lung area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Proliferating epithelial cells within the alveoli were characterized by variable morphologies, including a round cell shape typical of AT2 cells and a more polygonal to sometimes elongated shape resembling ADI cells. Surrounding terminal bronchioles, a proliferation of cuboidal airway epithelial cells forming pods, ribbons and tubules was observed. In the periphery, these peri-bronchiolar proliferates merged with areas of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, showing a transition from a cuboidal to a polygonal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Many cells showed atypical features such as cyto- and karyomegaly, bizarrely shaped and euchromatic nuclei, as well as abundant, partly atypical, mitotic figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). At 14 dpi, multifocal areas of epithelial proliferates were still observed, affecting 2.1% to 7.2% of the examined lung area, often around terminal airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, a majority of animals (7 out of 9) showed foci of sub-pleural fibrosis.</p><p id="P7">In summary, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters showed a prominent and heterogeneous epithelial proliferative response that was still recognizable at 14 dpi, beyond virus clearance. Next, we wanted to demonstrate that alveolar AT2 cells proliferate, mobilize and differentiate into AT1 cells through the ADI cell state and that airway-derived progenitors participate in alveolar regeneration, possibly through a transitional AT2 or ADI cell state, in the Syrian golden hamster.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2</label><title>CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells frequently express TP53 and persist until 14 dpi following SARS-CoV-2 induced DAD in hamsters</title><p id="P8">ADI cells are reported to originate from AT2 and/or a particular subset of club cells expressing MHC-II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The AT2 to ADI cell trans-differentiation process is characterized by gradual down-regulation of AT2 cell markers, expression of CK8 and cell cycle exit markers, as well as a morphologic transition from a round to a polygonal to elongated shape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> In the following, we focused on the first part of this AT2-ADI-AT1 trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">First, we detected proSP-C<sup>+</sup> AT2 and CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells using immunohistochemistry. Quantification was performed within total alveoli first, followed by a separate analysis in areas showing inflammation and/or epithelial proliferation (termed “affected alveoli”) and histologically unremarkable alveoli (termed “non-affected alveoli”). proSP-C expression was detected in cells with a round shape lining alveolar septa. In mock-infected animals, the number of proSP-C<sup>+</sup> cells was constant at all investigated time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, the total number of proSP-C<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly at 6 dpi, which was caused by an increase within affected alveoli. proSP-C<sup>+</sup> cells were found in small groups within inflammatory foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Scattered proSP-C<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in close proximity of terminal bronchioles. Interestingly, the majority of cells within the epithelial proliferates at 6 dpi were proSP-C.</p><p id="P10">CK8 was ubiquitously expressed in the apical cytoplasm of luminal cells within bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles in all animals. In the alveoli of mock-infected animals, rare elongated CK8<sup>+</sup> cells were observed, making up less than 1% of total alveolar cells. In SARS-CoV-2 infected animals however, CK8 was abundantly expressed within the epithelial proliferative foci at 3, 6 and 14 dpi and the number of CK8<sup>+</sup> cells in total alveoli was significantly increased compared to the mock group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Importantly, increased numbers of CK8<sup>+</sup> cells were detected within affected and non-affected alveoli. Within affected alveoli, the relative numbers of CK8<sup>+</sup> cells remained constantly elevated throughout the investigation period. CK8<sup>+</sup> cells displayed a variable cell morphology including round, polygonal, as well as elongated shapes with thin cytoplasmic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Double-labeling for proSP-C and CK8 demonstrated AT2 to ADI cell transition. At 3 dpi, numerous proSP-C<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>-</sup> cells and rare proSP-C<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells with a round AT2 cell morphology were observed within affected alveoli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 1A</xref>), whereas proSP-C<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> elongated cells were very rare. At 6 dpi, affected alveoli contained occasional proSP-C<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>-</sup> and proSPC<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> round cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These cells were intermingled with high numbers of proSP-C<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup>cells, which showed various morphologies ranging from round AT2-type to polygonal ADI-type cells as well as bizarre, irregularly shaped cells with karyomegaly. Moreover, elongated proSPC<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells with AT1-type morphology were occasionally observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 1B</xref>). At 14 dpi, numerous proSPC<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells with AT2 morphology as well as occasional proSPC<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> polygonal cells were still detected in alveoli, including morphologically non-affected alveoli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Once AT2 cells enter the ADI state, they exit the cell cycle to allow AT1 trans-differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. At 6 and 14 dpi, CK8<sup>+</sup> cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals expressed nuclear TP53, indicative of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). TP53 expression was particularly frequent in polygonal, large, bizarre, occasionally bi-nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). Of note, no TP53 expression was observed in the rare CK8<sup>+</sup> cells in the alveoli of mock-infected animals. Our findings demonstrated that the transition between AT2 and ADI cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters features: i) transient co-expression of proSP-C and CK8, ii) changes in cell morphology from round to elongated as well as iii) expression of cell cycle arrest markers.</p><p id="P13">In functional regeneration, ADI cells transdifferentiate into mature AT1, which assume an elongated morphology with thin cytoplasmic processes required for adequate gas exchange. In the following, we focused on the last part of this AT2-ADI-AT1 trajectory. Double-labeling with AT1 cell markers described for human and mouse (AGER, AQP5, PDPN) was not possible since the tested antibodies failed to specifically label AT1 cells in the hamster (<italic>data not shown)</italic>. For this reason, we performed transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate ADI to AT1 cell transition. In normal conditions, AT1 cells are characterized by a flattened morphology with slender processes containing a moderately electron-dense, organelle-poor cytoplasm and a round to oval nucleus with a moderate amount of peripheral heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. AT2 cells are characterized by a round morphology, an apico-basal polarity and a moderately electron-dense cytoplasm rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes. In addition, AT2 cells possess apical microvilli as well as membrane-bound vesicles containing multiple concentric membrane layers (multi-lamellar bodies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, proliferative foci at 6 dpi contained numerous AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 3A</xref>) as well as numerous hypertrophic epithelial cells with a variable cell morphology resembling ADI cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 4 A-B</xref>). Most importantly, cells sharing AT1 and AT2 cell features were observed in the alveolar lining at the edges of proliferative foci. The cells showed the flattened and elongated morphology of AT1 cells, but also characteristics of AT2 cells, such as microvilli on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem. Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Similar ultrastructural findings were present in COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The present findings demonstrate that the last part of the AT2-ADI-AT1 trajectory also occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters.</p><p id="P14">Finally, we sought to confirm that the ADI cells detected in the hamster share features with ADI cells in COVID-19 patients. For this, we used lung samples obtained from three patients with lethal COVID-19 ARDS. In addition, a fourth lung sample obtained from a lobectomy of a non-COVID case was used. Histologically, the lungs from all lethal COVID-19 ARDS cases showed features of moderate to severe, acute DAD, characterized by necrosis and sloughing of alveolar cells, fibrin exudation, hyaline membranes, alveolar edema and mild to moderate neutrophilic infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the non-COVID-19 sample, a suppurative bronchopneumonia was diagnosed, characterized by neutrophilic and histiocytic infiltrates in bronchioles and alveolar lumina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunolabeling showed the presence of round proSP-C<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells and polygonal to elongated proSP-C<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells, representing the different stages of ADI cells, in all lethal COVID-19 ARDS samples as well as the non-COVID-19 bronchopneumonia sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells expressing TP53 were only detected the three lethal COVID-19 ARDS samples, while no TP53 co-expression was detected in the ADI cells of the non-COVID-19 case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In conclusion, ADI cells are a feature of alveolar regeneration following SARS-CoV-2 induced DAD in lethal COVID-19 and its Syrian golden hamster model. These cells were also detected in low numbers under non-infectious conditions in the hamster and in a human sample with suppurative bronchopneumonia, confirming that ADI cells participate in physiological turnover and alveolar repair regardless of the etiology in both species. Importantly, only ADI cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters and humans expressed TP53, hinting at a prolonged block of these cells in the intermediate state.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>3</label><title>Multipotent airway-derived CK14<sup>+</sup> progenitors contribute to alveolar regeneration following SARS-CoV-2 induced DAD in hamsters</title><p id="P16">It is well accepted that upon severe alveolar injury, both AT1 and AT2 cells can be replenished by airway progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In the next step, we characterized the contribution of airway progenitors to alveolar regeneration in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. As described earlier, histopathological lesions at 6 and 14 dpi included foci of prominent alveolar epithelial proliferation with airway-like morphology that were frequently in anatomic continuity with bronchiolar-alveolar junctions. Thus, we determined 1) the cellular origin of these proliferates and 2) whether these progenitors differentiate into AT2 or ADI cells after migrating into the alveoli.</p><p id="P17">Multiple airway progenitor cell types have been reported to contribute to alveolar regeneration, including proSP-C<sup>+</sup>SCGB1A1<sup>+</sup> broncho-alveolar stem cells (BASCs), ΔNP63<sup>+</sup>CK5<sup>+</sup> distal alveolar stem cells (DASCs), ΔNP63<sup>+</sup>CK5<sup>+</sup>CK14<sup>+</sup> basal cells, and SCGB1A1<sup>+</sup> club cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a marked proliferation of CK14<sup>+</sup> cells in the airways, which peaked at 6 dpi and remained elevated until 14 dpi. The number of CK14<sup>+</sup> cells in total alveoli was significantly increased compared to the mock group at 3, 6 and 14 dpi, mirroring the increase in the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). CK14 was expressed by the majority of cells in the peri-bronchiolar proliferation forming pods and tubules continuous with terminal bronchioles at 6 dpi.

SCGB1A1 was not expressed in alveolar proliferation areas at 3 and 6 dpi. Interestingly, SCGB1A1<sup>+</sup> cells significantly increased in the alveoli of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals at 14 dpi.

Double-labeling with proSP-C revealed clusters of CK14<sup>+</sup>proSP-C<sup>+</sup> cells in the peri-bronchiolar pods and occasionally within the lining of terminal bronchioles. This indicates a potential differentiation of airway progenitors towards the AT2 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem.

Co-staining with CK8 showed a gradual phenotypical change in the direction of alveoli. Cells exiting the bronchiole showed a cuboidal morphology and a diffuse cytoplasmic CK14 expression. Towards alveoli, the cuboidal cells co-expressed CK14 and CK8. More distally, cells became more elongated and were characterized by CK14<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplem.

Survivors of acute disease may be faced with a wide spectrum of long-lasting symptoms, with pulmonary, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular sequelae at the forefront, which have a negative impact on the quality of life. Considering the staggering amount of patients reporting prolonged symptoms even as long as 15 months after the initial onset of COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, further research into potential pathomechanisms of this protracted recovery is urgently needed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. A possible explanation for the mechanisms underlying some PASC symptoms, such as dyspnea, shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, could be an impaired regeneration of alveolar tissue and lung fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. It has also been suggested that the persistence of CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells might be the cause of prolonged hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Importantly, these conclusions are based on observations from tissues collected from acute, lethal COVID-19 cases. In contrast, we can only speculate about the presence of these cells in PASC, since samples from affected humans are scarce. Therefore, establishment and further characterization of appropriate animal models of PASC are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters reliably phenocopy moderate to severe COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Recovering hamsters show a pronounced epithelial cell proliferation within airways and alveoli, which started at 3 dpi and was detectable until 14 dpi in the present study. This is in line with previous reports, which showed that proliferative foci can persist up to 31 dpi in hamsters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Here, we characterized the proliferating epithelial cell types in more detail. First, we investigated the AT2-ADI-AT1 trajectory. In mouse models of lung injury, the transition from AT2 to the ADI state is characterized by progressive decrease of cell sphericity, expression of CK8 and loss of AT2 marker expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Double-labelling of SPC and CK8 demonstrated the transition of AT2 to ADI cells, associated with phenotypical changes as described above in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. At 6 dpi, all stages of ADI cells were observed, including round, SPC<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells (early ADI stage) and polygonal, plump to elongated, SPCCK8+ cells (late ADI stage). Interestingly, at 14 dpi, we observed numerous round, SPC<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup>, early ADI stages and fewer late ADI stages, which could indicate a new wave of ADI cell generation at this time-point. Lineage tracing studies in the mouse bleomycin lung injury model demonstrated that ADI cells could develop from AT2 as well as from MHCII<sup>+</sup> club cells migrating from the airways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In early stages after injury, peaking at 5 dpi, ADI cells are mainly derived from AT2 cells, while club cell-derived ADI cells appear later, peaking at 10 dpi. Of note, a part of the MHCII<sup>+</sup> club cells differentiating towards ADI cells goes through an SPC<sup>+</sup> stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We speculate, that the round SPC<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells observed at 14 dpi in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters could be derived from airway progenitors analogous to murine MHCII<sup>+</sup> club cells, which transiently assume an AT2 stage.</p><p id="P33">In addition to the demonstration of transitional cell stages on a morphological level, the presence of ADI cells in the hamster model of COVID-19 was confirmed using transcriptome data analysis. In addition, we created hamster-specific marker gene lists for different alveolar cell populations, including AT1, ADI and AT2 cells. Importantly, numerous cells with an ADI gene signature were detected at 14 dpi, which is indicative of an ongoing regenerative process at this time point and in line with the results obtained by the quantification of CK8 positive cells by immunolabeling. At 5 dpi, cells with ADI gene expression clustered with AT1 and AT2 cells, suggestive of an AT2 origin. Interestingly, at 14 dpi, ADI gene expression was not found within the AT2 clusters. At this time point, a small number of ADI cells expressed a club cell signature. This observation reinforces the hypothesis, that two waves of ADI cells are generated in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters, which have their origin in AT2- and club cells, respectively.</p><p id="P34">CK8<sup>+</sup>ADI cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters frequently expressed nuclear TP53 protein. Transcriptome data also showed that some cells with ADI gene signature displayed high scores for <italic>p53 pathway</italic> and for <italic>DNA repair</italic> hallmark genes at 5 and 14 dpi. Nuclear TP53 regulates transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair and accumulation of TP53 is therefore detected in cells with high level of DNA damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. ADI cells undergo mechanical stretch-induced DNA damage while migrating to cover the denuded septa and to differentiate into AT1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. The nuclear expression of TP53 could reflect a particularly high level of injury, triggering DNA repair mechanisms. It is important to underline that in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, nuclear TP53 expression was often found in hypertrophic CK8<sup>+</sup> cells with a bizarre morphology, binucleation or karyomegaly. We assume that these hypertrophic cells have accumulated a high level of DNA damage, are blocked in the ADI stage and are not likely to differentiate into slender AT1 cells. A permanent block in the ADI cell state has been described in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and mouse models of lung fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Importantly, it has been demonstrated in a mouse model that induction of TP53-dependent AT2 senescence is sufficient to propagate progressive pulmonary fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Besides TP53, other signaling pathways have been implicated in ADI cell senescence. For instance, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in primary murine cells revealed that a chronic activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling can induce senescence and CK8 expression in ADI cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. In addition, persistent Notch activation in AT2 cells induces retarded differentiation of AT2 into AT1 cells, resulting in ADI cell accumulation in a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lung injury model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Moreover, persistent TGF-β signaling has been shown to block ADI cells from differentiating into AT1 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We showed that, from 5 to 14 dpi, an increasing number of cells with ADI gene signature had high scores for <italic>Wnt/ β-catenin</italic> and <italic>notch signaling</italic> hallmark genes. In contrast, genes belonging to the TGF-β signaling pathway showed no high scores at 14 dpi and were only detected in a small fraction of ADI cells at 5 dpi. Therefore, we speculate that prolonged Wnt/ β-catenin and/or notch signaling, rather than excessive TGF-β, could be responsible for the prolonged presence of ADI cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. However, the available data do not allow us to assess the duration of the activation of the respective pathways in ADI cells and further studies with a more detailed analysis and additional time points are warranted to confirm this hypothesis. Besides dysregulation of the discussed pathways, a direct contribution of viral infection to the induction of senescence must be considered.

In addition to fibrotic foci, our study also revealed a prominent presence of CD204<sup>+</sup> M2 macrophages starting at 3 dpi and persisting until 14 dpi. M2-macrophages are known to promote fibrosis by a variety of factors, including TGF-β secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Thus, the fibrosis could be promoted by the prolonged presence of an unfavorably polarized inflammatory response. In addition to macrophages, AT2 cells can promote a pro-fibrotic microenvironment by activating local fibroblasts to become myofibroblasts via paracrine signaling, as demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This process was initiated by an induction of an EMT process in the AT2 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Of note, it has been reported that EMT is activated in ADI cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and the results from our transcriptome analysis showed that cells with ADI gene signature score high for EMT pathway gene expression at 5 and 14 dpi in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. Therefore, besides M2-macrophages, ADI cells potentially contribute to a pro-fibrotic microenvironment. In addition, it has been reported that lung fibrotic lesions in COVID-19 patients are preceded by a prolonged blood vessel neo-formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Interestingly, transcriptome data revealed that numerous cells within AT1/ADI and ADI cell clusters showed high positive scores for <italic>angiogenesis</italic> hallmark genes at 14 dpi, suggesting that ADI cells in hamsters might contribute also to a pro-angiogenetic microenvironment, promoting vascular changes during lung fibrosis similar to COVID-19 patients. A recent study in a mouse model of COVID-19 demonstrated that aged mice infected with a mouse adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 show fibrotic lesions starting from 15 dpi and persisting up to 120 dpi <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Similar to what we observed in the hamster model, the lesions were characterized by a subpleural deposition of collagen and presence of α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts. The authors also described elevated numbers of M2-type macrophages, which persisted in chronic lesions. Moreover, this study also analyzed the dynamics of AT2-derived ADI cells and demonstrated that persistence of ADI cells is a feature of chronic lesions, in line with our findings in the hamster model. However, the study did not investigate airway progenitor cell contribution to alveolar regeneration. In contrast to this, we found a prominent airway progenitor mobilization into damaged alveoli in our hamster model, indicating that hamsters model this aspect of lung regeneration observed in humans more closely than mice.</p><p id="P37">Although pre-existing AT2 cells are described to be the predominant source of AT1s after alveolar damage, it is known that other cell types partake in regenerative processes, especially after severe injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In case of severe damage that involve broad epithelial denudation, basal cells can migrate into alveoli, become distal basal-like cells and subsequently promote alveolar regeneration giving rise to AT2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. A contribution of airway progenitors to alveolar repair has been reported in COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. In COVID-19 patients, the most prominent airway progenitors supporting alveolar regeneration were reported to be CK5<sup>+</sup> basal cells, which form the so-called “keratin 5 pods”. Basal cell expansion, also termed “pod”” is gradually recognized as common feature of epithelial remodeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. To a lesser extent, more immature CK5<sup>+</sup>p63<sup>+</sup> basal cells were also reported to support alveolar regeneration in COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Conversely, in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, we found predominantly CK14<sup>+</sup> cells within alveolar proliferation foci, resembling the human CK5<sup>+</sup> pods. Basal airways cells originate from the same CK5<sup>+</sup>CK14<sup>+</sup>p63<sup>+</sup> pool that gives rise to different combinations of CK5<sup>+/-</sup>, CK14<sup>+/-</sup>, p63<sup>+/-</sup> progenitor cells that will populate the airways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Some of these cells also have the potential to give rise to AT2 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. It appears that the subpopulation might differ among various species. Human lung multipotent cells can differ from murine ones, and in its turn, we might expect the same for other rodents like hamsters. The CK14<sup>+</sup> basal cells detected in our study were having similar features like the ones described for human CK5<sup>+</sup> cells, namely pods formation and differentiation towards AT2 cells, and therefore can be considered the hamster equivalent of human basal cells contributing to alveolar repair.</p><p id="P38">The authors recognize that the study has some limitations. First, this work provides a whole slide digital quantification of the main cell types involved in alveolar regeneration upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells. However, since that several tested antibodies (anti-AGER, -AQP5, -PDPN) failed to specifically recognize AT1 cells in hamsters, a quantification of these cells and demonstration of ADI-AT1 transition by double-labeling was not possible. Therefore, the ADI-AT1 transition was demonstrated with ultrastructural analysis, in line with previous COVID-19 reports. Second, we can only speculate on the clinical relevance ADI persistence and fibrotic lesions in the animals. However, once that this work confirmed hamsters to be a reliable model for these features, further investigations including longer time points and the assessment of lung function and gas-exchange capacity are warranted. Third, the conclusions regarding cell origins in this work are based on double-labelling and co-expression of genes interpreted in the context of published literature. Additional studies involving lineage-tracing are required to irrefutably prove cell trajectories.</p><p id="P39">In conclusion, our study provides a detailed characterization of cell populations composing the pulmonary epithelial regenerative response in the hamster and thus provides preliminary and highly needed information about this important translational COVID-19 model. We show that ADI cells and airway-derived progenitors participate in alveolar regeneration in the species, and provide evidence of ongoing regeneration post virus-clearance. Thus, hamsters are a suitable model to investigate the relevance of these changes and their actual contribution to PASC symptoms. However, further studies including a longer investigation period and more detailed clinical analyses are required. Since post-COVID-19 pathological lesions show overlap with other diseases featuring DAD and IPF, the model can be used for broader implications.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Hamster study</title><p id="P40">The animal experiment was in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63/EU and approved by the relevant local authorities (protocol code N032/2020 22 April 2020).

The bottom right panel shows that within alveolar proliferation foci, there are cells displaying karyomegaly and atypical mitotic figures (arrow). Data are shown as box and whisker plots. Data from Iba-1 quantification was tested by two-tailed Mann-Whitney-U test. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered significant. N□=□10 animals/group for mock and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. For quantifications, 1 longitudinal section containing all right lung lobes were evaluated. Source data will be provided as a source data file.

The AT2 to ADI cell trans-differentiation process is characterized by a decrease of pro surfactant protein-C (proSP-C) expression, increase of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) expression as well as a morphologic transition from a round to polygonal to elongated shape (see D). The ultrastructural hallmark of the ADI to AT1 trans-differentiation is the presence of cells with an elongated AT1 morphology and AT2 features, such as apical microvilli (see F). B, C Quantification of proSP-C<sup>+</sup> AT2 cells (B) and CK8<sup>+</sup> ADI cells (C) within total alveoli, non-affected alveoli, and affected alveoli as well as representative pictures of immunolabelling (brown signal, arrows) in the alveoli of mock and SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. D Representative double immunofluorescence image of an alveolar proliferation focus in a SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster at 6 dpi. Cells are labelled with CK8 (green) and proSP-C (red). An overview and higher magnification of the area delineated by a rectangle are shown. There are numerous proSP-C<sup>-</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup>ADI cells, some showing hypertrophy and elongated cytoplasmic processed (arrowheads) and single proSP-C<sup>+</sup>CK8<sup>+</sup> cells (asterisk) with a round morphology. E Representative double immunofluorescence of an alveolar proliferation focus in a SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster at 6 dpi. Cells are labelled with CK8 (green) and cell cycle exit marker TP53 (red). The arrowheads shows polygonal, large, bizarre TP53<sup>+</sup> ADI cells. F Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph showing alveoli of a SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster at 6 dpi. A basement membrane separates AT1 cells from the endothelial cells lining capillary spaces (C) containing erythrocytes. A leukocyte (L) as well as an AT2 cell (AT2) with apical microvilli (arrow) and numerous intracytoplasmic multi-lamellar bodies (red asterisks) are also seen. Red boxes and high magnification show cells with flattened and elongated morphology of AT1 cells, with characteristics of AT2 cells, such as microvilli (arrows). Quantification data are shown as box and whisker plots. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney-U test. For multiple comparisons between time points, a Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied. P- and q-values ≤0.05 were considered significant.
