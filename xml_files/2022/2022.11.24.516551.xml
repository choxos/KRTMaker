A challenging task to understand health and disease-related microbiome signatures is to move beyond descriptive community-level profiling towards disentangling microbial interaction networks. Here, we aimed to determine members taking on a keystone role in shaping community ecology of a widely used synthetic bacterial community (OMM<sup>12</sup>). Using single-species dropout communities and metabolomic profiling, we identified <italic>Bacteroides caecimuris</italic> I48, <italic>Blautia coccoides</italic> YL58 and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> KB1 as major drivers of <italic>in vitro</italic> community assembly and elucidated underlying mechanisms of these keystone functions. Importantly, keystone species and bacterial strain relationships were found to strongly vary across different nutritional conditions, depending on the strains’ potential to modify the corresponding environment. Further, gnotobiotic mice transplanted with communities lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 and <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 exhibited morphological anomalies and altered intestinal metabolomic profiles, exposing physiologically relevant functions of these keystone community members.

A current challenge in microbiome research is to predict and understand the functional relevance of particular microbial community configurations or “signatures”, associated with health or different diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Gut microbial community composition is influenced by a variety of abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, diet, host immune defenses, metabolites and microbe-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Bacterial interaction networks in particular form the basis of community assembly and structure. However, our understanding of the mechanistic basis underlying these interactions is still incomplete, which greatly limits the functional interpretation of microbiome signatures.</p><p id="P3">The intestinal microbiota is organized as complex trophic network where individual members engage in cooperative and competitive interactions by nutrient degradation, exchange of metabolites and production of inhibitory compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Pair-wise interactions are often influenced by the presence of one or more other species in the community and the resulting higher-order interactions limit the predictability of models based on pair-wise interactions alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). High-throughput sequencing and metabolomics technologies have generated a wealth of data, which can be exploited by modelling approaches to shed light on the underlying processes shaping the microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In particular, inference of microbial interaction and co-occurrence networks are powerful tools for delineating microbial community structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). While the computationally identified bacterial associations may result from true ecological relationships, they cannot be distinguished from associations occurring due to environmental selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Hence, the biological interpretation often remains uncertain and requires experimental validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). For this purpose, synthetic model communities are indicated, where members are well-characterized, interactions can be experimentally determined and hypotheses can be verified in a systematic way. These experimental model systems also enable the identification of community members with special importance for the ecosystem, i.e., keystones in Paine’s sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), by allowing the implementation of systematic presence-absence studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Microbial keystone taxa are highly connected taxa, which have a major influence on microbiome composition and function at a particular space or time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). These taxa often, but not always, have an over-proportional influence in the community, relative to their abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Hence, identifying and targeting keystone taxa may open new entry points for microbiome-targeted therapies.</p><p id="P4">Here, we aimed to identify keystone members of the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM<sup>12</sup>), a gut bacterial model community consisting of twelve species <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> KB1, <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> YL2, <italic>Acutalibacter muris</italic> KB18, <italic>Muribaculum intestinale</italic> YL27, <italic>Flavonifractor plautii</italic> YL31, <italic>Enterocloster clostridioformis</italic> YL32, <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> YL44, <italic>Turicimonas muris</italic> YL45, <italic>Clostridium inocuum</italic> I46, <italic>Bacteroides caecimuris</italic> I48, <italic>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</italic> I49 and <italic>Blautia coccoides</italic> YL58), representing the five major eubacterial phyla of the murine gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). This synthetic community is publicly available, adaptable and stable in gnotobiotic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In addition, it recapitulates important phenotypes of a complex microbiota in mice, including colonization resistance to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and immune development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In the past years, the OMM<sup>12</sup> model has been used by an increasing number of research groups in preclinical disease models, to study gut microbial ecology and evolution and the impact of diet, drugs and phages on the microbiome (25-29). Previous work analyzing mono- and pairwise co-cultures shed light on the metabolic capacity of individual strains and <italic>in vitro</italic> strain-strain interactions in the OMM<sup>12</sup> community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Now, we continued to explore the OMM<sup>12</sup> interaction network top-down by generating single-species dropout communities aiming to identify keystone species driving community assembly. We analyzed community assembly and strain relationships in different culture media in an <italic>in vitro</italic> batch culture approach, as well as in gnotobiotic mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate a strong environmental context-dependency and conditionality of the keystone species concept and highlight the need for experimental validation of association networks in the relevant biotic and abiotic environment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The carbohydrate environment configures bacterial key species driving community assembly <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P5">Previous work using the OMM<sup>12</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> community model revealed the strong impact of different media compositions on community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Here, to gain insights into the role of the twelve individual strains in community assembly in different nutritional environments, twelve dropout consortia were generated, each lacking one individual strain at a time. Community assembly of all thirteen communities (twelve drop-out consortia, one OMM<sup>12</sup> full consortium) were studied using a batch culture approach, with slight modifications to the previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Communities were stabilized for four days with serial dilutions every 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and the absolute abundance of the individual OMM<sup>12</sup> strains at day four of cultivation was determined by qPCR as normalized 16S rRNA copies per ml culture. The chosen rich culture media differ in the supplied carbohydrate sources: AF medium contains glucose as the major carbon source, while APF medium was supplemented with different mono- (arabinose, lyxose, xylose, rhamnose and fucose) and polysaccharides (mucin, xylan and inulin).</p><p id="P6">Of note, while the species richness was the same in both media, with eight of twelve bacteria of the consortium coexisting after four days of cultivation, differences in absolute abundance of the strains were observed between AF and APF media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis of the median absolute abundance of the individual strains in all communities revealed clear differences (95% confidence interval) between communities grown in AF medium and APF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Notably, three dropout communities stood out from the corresponding clusters: the community lacking <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in AF medium and the communities lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 and <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 in APF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This suggests that depending on the nutritional environment, different bacterial strains take on a key ecological role in driving community assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Altered community assembly is linked to distinct environmental modifications</title><p id="P7">We hypothesized that the influence of an individual strain on community assembly is connected to changes in the metabolic environment. To test this, we analyzed spent culture media by untargeted metabolomics. Thereby, a list of unique metabolomics features was curated and compared between fresh and spent media (SM) of the corresponding communities. All samples from communities lacking <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in AF medium and <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48, as well as <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 in APF medium showed distinct metabolomic profiles compared to the other communities in the respective media by both, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) and hierarchical clustering of significantly changing metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This indicated that the strains’ key role in community assembly is strongly connected to their abilities to modify the chemical environment. Specifically, amino acid production and depletion profiles revealed that only communities including <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 depleted serine and arginine in both culture conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). On the other hand, communities lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 in APF medium stood out with lower levels of alanine compared to the medium blank, indicating the importance of this strain for alanine accumulation.</p><p id="P8">Targeted measurements of SCFA levels in the spent culture media further revealed significantly decreased concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, isovaleric acid, isobutyric acid and methylbutyric acid in <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 dropout communities cultured in APF medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In contrast, communities lacking <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 cultured in AF medium showed significantly increased levels of propionic acid, methylbutyric acid, valeric acid and isovaleric acid and significantly decreased lactic acid concentrations. Of note, butyric acid levels were strongly depleted in communities lacking <italic>F. plautii</italic> YL31 compared to the full consortium. This is in line with information obtained by genome based metabolic models and monoculture <italic>in vitro</italic> data identifying this strain as butyrate producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Of note, butyric acid levels were also significantly decreased in the dropout community lacking <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58, in which <italic>F. plautii</italic> YL31 was as well not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Analysis of pH changes (<italic>ΔpH</italic> = <italic>pH<sub>SM</sub> — pHf<sub>resh me</sub>aium</italic>) in SM revealed that communities lacking <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 showed stronger acidification than the OMM<sup>12</sup> community in both media conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In APF medium all communities exhibit more acidic spent medium pH (ΔpH &lt; -1.0) compared to communities in AF medium with the exception of the <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 dropout consortium. Here, a less drastic change in pH was found (ΔpH &gt; - 0.5), indicating that the strong acidification of APF SM is predominantly due to <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dissecting strain-strain interactions in the community context using dropout consortia</title><p id="P10">We next compared the absolute abundance of all strains in the corresponding dropout communities to the absolute abundance in the full consortium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This analysis revealed, that the absence of certain strains have a strong impact on the other strains’ abundances. The strains that influenced the highest number of other strains were <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1, affecting five and four strains, <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 affecting one and three strains and <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 affecting two and two strains in AF and APF medium, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This is in line with observations made based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis of community assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Specifically, in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 dropout communities, the abundance of five other species was increased in AF medium. Among those, strains <italic>B. animalis</italic> YL2, <italic>F. plautii</italic> YL31 and <italic>C. innocuum</italic> I46 were previously shown to be inhibited in presence of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In the absence of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48, three strains were more abundant in APF medium (<italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> YL44 and <italic>C. innocuum</italic> I46). Of note, <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 was completely excluded from the consortium in APF medium in the presence of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). In the absence of <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58, two strains were more abundant (<italic>E. clostridioformis</italic> YL32 in AF and <italic>T. muris</italic> YL45 in APF medium), while the abundance of two strains was decreased (<italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 in AF and <italic>F. plautii</italic> YL31 in APF medium). Notably, <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 was only detected in the consortium in the presence of <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58, indicating a positive dependency of <italic>M. intestinale</italic> YL27 on <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 in the glucose condition but not in APF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Concluding, this underlines that different community members take on a keystone role in community assembly by strongly affecting the abundance of several other strains, depending on the nutritional environment: <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in AF medium and <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 and <italic>B. coccoides</italic> in APF medium.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The keystone function of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> is dependent on the availability of polysaccharides</title><p id="P12">The pronounced effect <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 had on community assembly in the APF medium, paired with the observation of strongly decreased spent culture medium pH and altered metabolic profiles, suggested a strong interdependency between the availability of polysaccharides and the ability of this strain to degrade polysaccharides. In line with this hypothesis, xylan and inulin concentrations in spent culture media of communities grown in APF medium were significantly reduced in the full community compared to the consortium lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). This was further substantiated by the presence of genes encoding the key enzymes of xylan and inulin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) in the <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab. S1</xref>). To confirm that the strong influence of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 on community assembly and spent media pH is indeed mediated by the presence of polysaccharides, we generated a polysaccharide deficient variant of APF medium (APF<sup>mod</sup>). This medium differs from AF medium as the remaining carbohydrate sources are several C5 and C6 sugars, excluding glucose (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Comparing community composition and absolute strain abundances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) revealed that <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 was significantly less abundant in APF<sup>mod</sup> compared to APF medium. Moreover, none of the initially altered strains showed significant changes in absolute abundances compared to the full consortium in APF<sup>mod</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of xylan and inulin, <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 did not acidify the culture medium as observed for APF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This is in line with the observation that specific SCFAs, namely acetic acid, lactic acid and propionic acid, that were significantly decreased in communities lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 in APF medium, were unaltered in APF<sup>mod</sup> medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the keystone role of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 in APF medium is strongly linked to its ability to consume xylan and inulin.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>E. faecalis</italic> interactions are multifaceted in the community context</title><p id="P13">While <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 was previously shown to dominate strain relationships by metabolic interactions in a glucose-rich environment, the strain also inhibited several other community members by bacteriocin production (<italic>B. animalis</italic> YL2, <italic>F. plautii</italic> YL31, <italic>E. clostridioformis</italic> YL32, <italic>C. innocuum</italic> I46 and <italic>L. reuteri</italic> I49) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 harbors several bacteriocin-encoding loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), including enterocin L50, an enterococcal leaderless bacteriocin with broad target range among Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We hypothesized that direct interference competition contributes to the capacity of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 to dominate community assembly. The inhibitory effect of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in the community context was most pronounced for <italic>B. animalis</italic> YL2, which is not able to colonize the full OMM<sup>12</sup> consortium, but can only establish itself in a community lacking <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 in both media conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). A phenotyping approach testing <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 mutants with individual deletions in the three loci for enterocin production (enterocin L50 A and B, enterocin O16 and enterocin E96) identified enterocin L50 A and B as the toxin active against the other community members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we performed batch culture experiments to analyze the phenotype of the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 ΔL50 mutant strain in the community context in AF and APF medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, full data set <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>B. animalis</italic> YL2 was abundant in the OMM<sup>12</sup> community including the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 ΔL50 mutant strain but not in the presence of the wildtype in both nutritional conditions.

On the other hand, abundance of <italic>C. innocuum</italic> I46 was also decreased in the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 ΔL50 mutant community, indicating that the observed negative effect of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 is not due enterocin production, but is mediated by other means such as substrate competition or end product inhibition in both media conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

If a strain y was not detectable in a specific dropout community, but in the full community, the strain relationship was defined as a positive dependency. If a strain y was only detected in a specific dropout community, but never in the presence of the corresponding strain, the interaction outcome was defined as exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

This ratio is known to be high in germ-free mice and strongly reduced in mice associated with a complex microbiota. For this reason, relative cecal weight is often used as an indicator of the impact of the microbiota on intestinal physiology.

In contrast, cecal metabolomic profiles of mice colonized with the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 dropout consortium did not differ from the full consortium control.

Specifically, we identified three environment-dependent keystone species, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1, <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 and <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58. Importantly, the kind and extent of how the three species affected community composition differed across culturing conditions and between sampling sites in the murine gut. While <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1, a low-abundant member of the mouse microbiome, strongly influenced community assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> by substrate competition and enterocin production, only minor changes in the bacterial abundance of the other community members, metabolomics profiles and physiology of the host were observed in intestinal regions of gnotobiotic mice stably colonized with a <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1 dropout community. This difference could be due to the overall low relative absolute abundance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in the gut of OMM<sup>12</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Increased abundance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is found in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), in antibiotic-treated individuals, graft-versus-host disease or inflammatory bowel disease mouse models, suggesting other environments, where <italic>E. faecalis</italic> potentially takes on a keystone role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Our in vitro data suggest, that enterocin-mediated competition is dependent on the nutritional environment, as it was observed in all media conditions except for GAM – and apparently also not in the gut of healthy gnotobiotic mice. Of note, colicin or microcin-dependent competition of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> is also not seen in healthy mice but takes place in the inflamed gut where iron is limiting and both species are highly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In contrast to <italic>E. faecalis</italic> KB1, communities lacking <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 showed distinctly altered metabolomics profiles across culturing conditions and in the murine cecum. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the presence of <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48 was positively associated with most other species, whereas <italic>in vitro</italic>, more negative strain relationships with other community members were detected. <italic>B. caecimuris</italic> I48´s keystone role <italic>in vitro</italic> was linked to the presence of the polysaccharides xylan and inulin.

Most strikingly, from overall reduced total bacterial abundance in the lower murine gut an increase in cecal to mouse body weight ratio would have been expected; instead it was significantly reduced. The mechanisms underlying the role of <italic>B. coccoides</italic> YL58 in microbiota-host cross-talk will be subject of future work.
