Improved therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to better intervene particularly in severe cases of the disease. They should aim at controlling the hyper-inflammatory state generated upon infection, at reducing lung tissue pathology and endothelial damages, along with viral replication. Previous research has pointed a possible role for the chaperone HSP90 in SARS-CoV-2 replication and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Pharmacological intervention through HSP90 inhibitors was shown to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, infections and reducing replication of diverse viruses. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the potent HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib <italic>in vitro</italic> on alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to characterize its effects on cell activation and viral replication. Additionally, to evaluate its efficacy in controlling systemic inflammation and the viral burden after infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, a Syrian hamster model was used. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Ganetespib reduced viral replication on AECs in a dose-dependent manner and lowered significantly the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, in both AECs and alveolar macrophages. <italic>In vivo</italic>, administration of Ganetespib led to an overall improvement of the clinical condition of infected animals, with decreased systemic inflammation, reduced edema formation and lung tissue pathology. Altogether, we show that Ganetespib could be a potential medicine to treat moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat with more than 600 million people infected and more than 6 million deaths reported worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Estimations by the WHO, based on the excess of average death rates, consider even higher numbers, counting up to 15 million deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Infections with the beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, lead mostly to rather mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic. However, in around 5% of the cases, the disease can progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with increased lung injury, pulmonary barrier dysfunctions and edema formation in the lungs, being associated with high mortality rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The mechanisms involved in its pathogenicity are still incompletely understood. Dysregulated systemic and mucosal immune responses, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, increased neutrophil recruitment, and robust activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade, are frequently observed manifestations of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Pre-existing comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease or age were correlated to higher chances of developing more severe cases of the disease and higher mortality rates. This is probably due to an impaired immunological response to the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry occurs after binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on the surface of different cell types. Within the lower airways, pulmonary epithelial cells are the main cell type expressing ACE2, and are promptly infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, macrophages are strongly activated by the virus uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Together, this leads to a strong immune activation upon infection, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Although the endothelial cell layer is likely only barely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is directly affected by the local inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This may occasionally lead to cell dysfunction, cell death and the deterioration of the barrier functions, which are characteristics of ARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Facing the prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the appearance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, waning immunity and vaccine hesitancy, an increase in the number of infections and admission in the intensive care units is being seen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In severe cases of the disease, antiviral drugs may not be sufficient to ameliorate patient’s conditions, as a systemic inflammation may have already been established. The administration of glucocorticoids, targeting the uncontrolled hyper-inflammation has been evaluated on patients for its efficacy in reducing disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, improvements were usually only reported for some specific cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, corticosteroids, like dexamethasone, were shown to induce lung epithelial cell senescence and promote pulmonary fibrosis, what might further contribute to lung tissue pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The production of cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to tissue inflammation and immune cell recruitment, is partially regulated by heat-shock proteins (HSPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. HSPs are one among the most abundant proteins in mammalian cells. They constitute a large family of chaperones that upon stress caused by heat, hypoxia or oxidative stress, assist the assembly, stabilization and translocation of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. HSP90, including the isoforms HSP90α and HSP90β, is crucial for the maturation of proteins involved in cell division and differentiation, having a broad range of substrates, including kinases and transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The pharmacological intervention through HSP90 inhibitors was shown to be beneficial in the most variated spectrum of diseases, including the treatment of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The potent HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib is being currently used in phase III studies in oncology and as an antiviral drug against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It has been shown to present promising pharmacokinetics properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. HSP90 inhibition was also shown to be efficient in reducing viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, affecting the synthesis of important viral transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, they were shown to exert barrier protective functions on pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and possess important antiinflammatory properties. Therefore, being useful as a therapeutic strategy in ARDS and other pulmonary inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Wyler et al. (2020)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> showed an up-regulation of expression of hsp90 transcripts in Calu-3 and H1299 lung epithelial cells upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, targeting HSP90 could be a valuable strategy to prevent disease progression and lung inflammation during severe cases of COVID-19.</p><p id="P5">The development of novel therapeutic strategies to better intervene in severe cases of COVID-19 is urgently needed.

To better characterize the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of Ganetespib on differentiated AECs, we infected cells for 1 h with 5 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFUs of SARS-CoV-2, and treated them for 16 h with different concentrations of Ganetespib, ranging from 12.5 nM to 800 nM. Virus titer was assessed by the measurement of infectious viral particles in the AECs supernatant. Ganetespib treatment led to a statistically significant inhibition in viral production already at 100 nM. Effects on viral load reduction were similar in higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Neufeldt and colleagues (2022)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> showed that upon infection of lung epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2, NF-kB signaling was activated, leading to the expression of specific inflammatory cytokines. Contrarily, induction of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) was not typically seen in COVID-19, probably due to the antagonist role of the open reading frame 6 (ORF6), an accessory gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, on interferon signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. To better characterize the impact of Ganetespib treatment on the expression of distinct inflammatory cytokines and stress-related genes, we performed RNA sequencing from infected AECs. Inhibition of HSP90 led to a substantial reduction of expression of NFKBIA transcripts. Moreover, transcripts of genes related to the IFN response, including IFIT2 and ISG15, and of several inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IFNB1 and CXCL10, typically up-regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, were overall reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>).

Similar to the observation made in infected AECs, genes belonging to the IFN response, including IRFs and ISGs, showed reduced expression after Ganetespib treatment. Ganetespib treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1b and IL6, genes belonging to IFN signaling and related to fibrosis, when compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Administration of Ganetespib on infected hamsters does not affect pulmonary viral loads</title><p id="P17">Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, Syrian hamsters present a moderate course of COVID-19, resembling many aspects of the disease in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

To assess the effects of the HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory medicine in SARS-CoV-2 infection, Syrian hamsters were infected with 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 and divided into 3 groups with three animals each. Group 1 received Ganetespib at day 0, group 2 received Ganetespib at day 0 and at day 4 p.i. and a third untreated group served as control.

At day 1 post-treatment, Ganetespib was detected in lungs with concentrations ranging from 10 to 15 nM, and in serum up to 6 nM.

Infected lung tissue presented increased infiltration of immune cells and accumulation of fluids with edema formation, seen by the darker areas on the histology of the whole tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-F</xref> left). Analysis of the epithelial cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-F</xref> middle) and the alveolar space, including the endothelial cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-F</xref> right), showed increased cell hyperplasia and inflammation after infection. Treatment with Ganetespib was sufficient to reduce tissue pathology and inflammation, as seen in a general overview of the tissue, when compared to the untreated control group. Treatment with Ganetespib reduced pathology scores, particularly in the alveolar compartment with a significant reduction on the lung affected area among animals of group 2 at day 7 p.i.

In order to better translate the actual treatment course in human patients, we repeated the infection model of Syrian hamsters with a later application time-point of the HSP90 inhibitor. Infected hamsters were divided into 3 groups with four animals each, receiving mock treatment (GB control), or treatment with Ganetespib at day 2 (GB 48h) or at day 3 p.i.

Animal body-weight changes were recorded daily after infection and already at day 2 p.i. a decrease in body-weight was seen in all groups, reaching a maximum of 5 % reduction to the original weight at day 5 p.i.. No significant weight loss differences were observed after treatment of the infected animals with Ganetespib, compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The concentration of Ganetespib after treatment in lung homogenate and serum was measured by mass spectrometry at day 5 p.i., which represented day 3 (GB 48h) or 2 (GB 72h) after Ganetespib application. Ganetespib concentrations in the lung were below 10 nM 2 days after Ganetespib application (GB 72h), similar to what was seen before, and slightly lower 3 days after application.</p><p id="P20">In serum, similar values were observed among animals receiving Ganetespib 48h p.i., while in the second group it was not detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3A</xref>). RT-qPCR analysis of the lung tissue for viral genome shows an increase in the viral burden in both animal groups treated with Ganetespib, in comparison to mock-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Viral titers of the group GB 72h were slightly higher than the titers of the GB 48h group, but not statistically different.

Histology of the lung tissue was also performed after staining with hematoxylin and eosin for characterization of tissue damage and cellular infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Overall, the area of the lungs affected by the infection was reduced with the treatment at 48 h p.i., compared to control, with decreased edema formation, epithelial and endothelial cell damage, not seen among the animals treated with Ganetespib at 72h p.i.. Analysis by semi-quantitative scores of lung tissue pathology showed a significant reduction in the total area affected by pneumonia after treatment with Ganetespib at 48 h p.i. when compared to the control group.

Aiming at protecting the more vulnerable patients that may develop severe cases of the disease, different treatment strategies that aim at reducing virus titers and the systemic inflammation taking place after infection are urgently required. Here, we demonstrate the positive effects of Ganetespib, an HSP90 inhibitor, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers on AEC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and its anti-inflammatory and tissue protective role in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Ganetespib could reduce viral loads in AECs and led to a reduced expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines on AECs and alveolar macrophages, which are normally associated with COVID-19. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we showed that, though Ganetespib had limited antiviral capacities, lung tissue pathology severity was reduced by the treatment with this inhibitor. Inflammation area, edema formation and lung epithelial cell damage were overall reduced after treatment of infected hamsters with Ganetespib, evidencing the positive properties of Ganetespib as a potential medicine for moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.</p><p id="P22">Many viruses were shown to be highly dependent on HSP90 for replication, depending on this chaperone for proper folding and function of the newly rapidly-synthesized viral proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. HSP90 inhibition by Ganetespib regulates viral replication by affecting the degradation or deactivation of important proteins involved in the replication machinery, such as particle assembly, exosome formation and cellular infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Therefore, inhibition of HSP90 can lead to a reduction in viral replication, as shown for HSV type I and EBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Here, we show that upon infection of AECs by SARS-CoV-2, Ganetespib was efficient in reducing viral loads in these cells in a dose-dependent manner, with effects observed with concentrations above 100 nM. Contrarily to AECs, we did not observe a reduction in viral loads in infected hamsters after treatment with Ganetespib, where rather an increase in the viral load was seen. Different from the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, the concentration of the HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> after i.p. application was considerably low, being comparable to the lowest doses analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our hamster model, concentrations achieved in serum and lung tissue were approximately 10 nM after 1-day application, with reduced or non-detectable levels at later time-points, as seen by the mass spectrometry analysis. Normal ranges of <italic>in vitro</italic> applications vary between 100 nM and 1 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, even if not sufficient to block viral replication, the systemic levels of Ganetespib showed efficient anti-inflammatory properties, dampening the production of important cytokines and chemokines after infection, as described by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. With increased viral titers and reduced inflammation, an impaired immune response to the virus was seen. Future experiments aiming at the HSP90 inhibition should better consider the pharmacokinetics of this molecule, and consider distinct mechanisms to provide higher doses of this inhibitor systemically, possibly through distinct routes of application.</p><p id="P23">The pleiotropic effects of HSP90 include degradation of distinct proteins, including MAPK, JAK/STAT and NF-kB, affecting distinct signaling pathways implicated in inflammation, cell proliferation and fibrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. HSP90 inhibition was shown to promote the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation of the lung tissue, and in this way, influence the recruitment and activation of important immune cells, including neutrophils and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Production of important pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL10, TNFSF10 and TNF, which are correlated to the progression of COVID-19, were shown to be reduced by HSP90 inhibition, probably due to the role of HSP90 in the IKK and NF-kB activation pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Here, we could also show that Ganetespib could abrogate NF-kB signaling, with reduction in the expression of NFKBIA and cytokines after treatment. Impaired type I IFN immunity is a major risk factor in COVID-19, and is normally associated with the inadequate immune response observed in aged individuals. IFN signaling was shown to have a pivotal role in COVID-19 by coordinating an appropriate inflammatory response against viral infection and the subsequent activation of the innate and adaptive immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. We could also observe a reduction in the expression of important genes involved in the IFN-signaling pathway, that may have contributed to the reduced tissue pathology observed. It is possible that the overall reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators observed could have led to a decreased activation of immune cells, affecting the animal immune response to the infection and further contributing to the higher viral titers observed.</p><p id="P24">Previous studies by our group showed a strong effect of the glucocorticoid Dexamethasone, applied alone or in combination with a monoclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2, in modulating the immune response against virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Although this glucocorticoid was promising in reducing disease severity in both Syrian and Roborovski dwarf hamsters (this model approaching the severe cases of the disease in human patients), it showed significant effects in reducing the immune cell infiltration into the infected tissue. This could lead to an exacerbated viral spread in the tissue and the prolonged activation of the immune system, contributing to the development of different pathological conditions in the patient, including post-COVID-19 lung fibrosis. In contrast to Dexamethasone administration, Ganetespib had no adverse effect on the immune cell compartment, necessary for the viral control on the lung tissue, as we could not detect any differences in cell counts observed in the lung tissue after treatment.</p><p id="P25">Reports have characterized the development of fibrotic lungs in COVID-19 patients, which may progress even after disease resolution, with virus eradication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Monocytes and profibrotic macrophages play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of both ARDS and lung fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> and a pronounced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages, which have a profibrotic nature, was seen in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Lung fibrosis is driven predominantly by TGF-β, which normally is involved in tissue repair and resolution of the damage, and an exacerbated TGF-β production is frequently observed in COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Inhibition of HSP90 was shown to be effective in attenuating fibroblast activation and blocking the signaling pathway of TGF-β, inhibiting the production of extracellular matrix and collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Ganetespib could likely attenuate the progression of fibrosis in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis when applied daily for 3 weeks, suggesting a role in the treatment of fibrotic lung disease, especially problematic in ARDS patients receiving mechanical ventilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Here, we fail to show a reduction of fibrotic markers after treatment of alveolar macrophages with Ganetespib. Further experiments are needed to better characterize the development of fibrotic lungs in COVID-19 and to evaluate the role of Ganetespib as possible anti-fibrotic therapeutic.</p><p id="P26">The endothelial cell layer, in contrast to epithelial cells, has low expression of the ACE2 receptor. Infection of these cells by SARS-CoV-2 occurs therefore mainly via uptake of viral particle by endocytosis, not contributing to viral replication. However, upon tissue infection, endothelial cells can also get activated and contribute to the inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The anti-inflammatory property observed by HSP90 inhibition was shown to protect the endothelial layer, contributing to a reduction in barrier dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Here, we also show that Ganetespib has a protective role on the endothelial cell layer, as seen by reduced lung tissue endotheliitis, which may have contributed to a decrease in lung barrier dysfunction and edema formation. However, a delayed application of Ganetespib (at 72h p.i.) was not sufficient to protect animals from disease progression, with lung tissue pathology being similar to the observed among untreated animals. Probably, a delayed treatment with Ganetespib, combined with an increase in viral loads had the opposite effect to what was expected, with increased and prolonged inflammation of the tissue. To better determine the efficacy of this inhibitor in reducing tissue inflammation and tissue pathology, frequency and timing of the administration of this inhibitor should be taken into consideration.</p><p id="P27">Altogether, we describe here distinct beneficial properties of HSP90 inhibition with Ganetespib in controlling cellular activation and tissue inflammation, and in this line, contributing to tissue protection in COVID-19. We postulate that in future experiments, a combinatory strategy of treatment with Ganetespib and different antiviral compounds could be beneficial in moderate and severe cases of the disease, where Ganetespib would promote stabilization of the endothelial barrier of the lung, diminish inflammation and promote tissue protection, whilst reduced viral replication would lead to improvements in the disease outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS159092-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the support of Jeannine Wilde and Madlen Sohn from the BIH/MDC Genomics Technology platform in Berlin for the sequencing.

Concentrations ranged from 12.5 nM Ganetespib to a maximum of 800 nM on a log2 scale. Non-treated or non-infected cells serve as control. (A) Viral titers in supernatants of AECs infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with the indicated concentration of Ganetespib.

(C) Expression of selected genes in AECs after SARS-CoV-2 or mock-infection, and treatment with Ganetespib. Shown are DESeq2 normalized counts on a log10 scale. Alveolar macrophages were differentiated from lung tissue and infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment with Ganetespib. Mock infected cells, treated or non-treated, served as control. (D) Heatmaps of differently expressed genes in alveolar macrophages after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and treatment with Ganetespib. Uninfected cells, receiving Ganetespib or not, were used as controls.

Treatment was performed at day 0 p.i. or at day 0 and again at day 4 p.i. and lung tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological comparisons. Shown are whole lung sections, and magnification of the epithelial or endothelial layers. Lung pneumonia with edema formation is seen in darker colors, due to the accumulation of fluids and cells. Representative histology is shown. Semi-quantitative analysis of histological lesions quantified at day 3, 5 and 7 p.i. were scored and shown for comparisons between the groups. Lung affected area (G), alveolar edema (H), AT2 cell hyperplasia (I) and lung endotheliitis (J) are shown. Results are displayed as mean ± SE and n=3.
