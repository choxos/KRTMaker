Treatment of nasal cultures with type 2 cytokine IL-13 to mimic asthmatic airways differentially impacts HCoV replication, enhancing MERS-CoV replication but reducing that of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63.

Three of these HCoVs emerged from animal reservoirs to cause significant public emergencies in the past 20 years and have been categorized as lethal HCoVs due to their propensity to cause life-threatening pneumonia in infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang, Grunewald and Perlman, 2020</xref>). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV first appeared in South China and caused an epidemic beginning in 2002 that resulted in a total of 8,422 infections and 916 deaths (case-fatality rate 11%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chan-Yeung <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has caused over 2500 cases and 894 deaths (case-fatality rate of 34.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">MERS-CoV Worldwide Overview, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">MERS Situation Update, 2022</xref>). Most recently, SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in the ongoing global pandemic that has caused over 570 million cases and 6.3 million deaths (as of 7/27/22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">World Health Organization COVID19 Dashboard, 2022</xref>). Four additional HCoVs (HCoV-NL63, -229E, -OC43, and HKU1) infect humans, circulate seasonally (causing 15-25% of common cold cases), and are generally associated with less severe respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wat, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaunt <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Importantly, while the seasonal/common HCoVs typically cause self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in humans, they can cause more severe disease and lower respiratory tract infections in at-risk populations such as neonates, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chiu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P3">CoVs have been classified into distinct genera based on serology and phylogenetic clustering. All three lethal HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and two of the nonlethal HCoVs (HCoV-OC43, -HKU1) are betacoronaviruses, while HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhou, Qiu and Ge, 2021</xref>). CoVs of all genera are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with large (~30 kilobases) genomes that exhibit highly conserved genomic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Perlman and Netland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang, Grunewald and Perlman, 2020</xref>). While all CoVs encode 16 nonstructural proteins that function primarily in replication and transcription as well as structural proteins, each CoV subgenera encodes a unique set of interspersed accessory proteins that are dispensable for CoV replication but serve important roles in host immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Perlman and Netland, 2009</xref>; Xiang et al., 2014). For example, within the betacoronavirus genus, MERS-CoV (a merbecovirus) encodes well-characterized immune antagonists NS4a and NS4b while SARS-CoV-2 (a sarbecovirus) lacks these accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Comar <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the nonlethal HCoVs tend to encode fewer accessory proteins than the lethal HCoVs, which may partially explain differences in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Despite differences among HCoVs in disease severity, relatively few studies take a comparative approach to understand CoV replication and how these viruses may interact uniquely with the host.</p><p id="P4">All successful respiratory pathogens enter and establish a primary infection in the nasal epithelium, despite its physical barrier function with apical tight junctions and robust mucociliary clearance machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hiemstra, McCray and Bals, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hariri and Cohen, 2016</xref>). The nasal epithelium also serves as an important immune sentinel site where innate immune responses such as antimicrobial peptide production, interferon (IFN) production and signaling, and cytokine/chemokine signaling to recruit immune cells is initiated. Basal expression levels of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are particularly high in the nasal epithelium, suggesting that this primary barrier site may be primed for response to invading viral pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Loske <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These barriers and host responses in the nasal epithelium likely play important roles in limiting the spread of HCoVs and other respiratory pathogens to the lower airway, preventing more severe airway disease such as lethal pneumonia. Studies comparing bronchial and nasal epithelial cells also highlight differences in innate immune responses in the upper vs. lower airway in the context of exposure to inflammatory stimuli and microbial antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Comer, Elborn and Ennis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hawley <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Nasal epithelial cells tended to respond more robustly to inflammatory stimuli (cigarette smoke, bacterial lipopolysaccharides) than donor-matched bronchial cells, further suggesting that the nose may be primed to respond to invading microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Comer, Elborn and Ennis, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Various lines of evidence highlight the importance of the nasal epithelium in CoV pathogenesis. It has been proposed that aerosolized viral particles achieve the greatest deposition density in the nasal cavity, leading to primary infection in the nose, followed by viral spread to the lower airway via a nasal/oral-lung aspiration axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Booth <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Farzal <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Aspiration from the nasal/oral-pharynx occurs even in healthy individuals during sleep, and its role in other lower airway pathologies is widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gleeson, Eggli and Maxwell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gaeckle <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Recent work with SARS-CoV-2 also emphasizes the role of nasal epithelial immune responses as determinants of pathogenicity. For example, a single-cell RNA sequencing study comparing nasopharyngeal swabs in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients found that, despite similar viral loads, patients with mild symptoms showed strong induction of antiviral IFN response genes in the nose, whereas patients with more severe symptoms had muted antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Other studies have shown that early innate immune responses in the nose have a direct impact on early viral replication levels, which have been correlated with the likelihood of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cheemarla <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, control of HCoV replication and elimination at the initial site of infection (the nasal epithelium) is critical for the prevention of more severe symptoms and spread to the lower airway, as well as for reducing transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gómez-Carballa <italic>et al</italic>.,2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We previously utilized a primary epithelial culture system in which patient-derived nasal cells are grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) to characterize replication and induction of innate immunity by SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). These nasal ALI cultures closely recapitulate many features of the <italic>in vivo</italic> nasal epithelium, such as cell types present (ciliated cells, mucus-producing goblet cells, as well as basal cells that repopulate the epithelium as cells senesce) and functions (epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary function), and thus provide an optimal system in which to study HCoV replication and HCoV-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tamashiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pezzulo <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kohanski <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Additionally, nasal ALI cultures can be manipulated with various cytokine or drug treatments to induce changes in the airway epithelium that mirror specific disease states. For example, treatment of these cultures with IL-13, a type 2 cytokine that is known to play a role in allergy and asthma pathogenesis in humans along with IL-4 and IL-5, induces goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion, replicating the tissue landscape in an asthmatic airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ordoñez <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rogers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kanoh, Tanabe and Rubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Everman, Rios and Seibold, 2019</xref>). The impact of IL-13 treatment on HCoV replication is of particular interest, as most clinical association studies have shown that individuals with allergic asthma (mediated by type 2 cytokines such as IL-13) are either less prone to developing severe COVID-19 or are at no increased risk than the general population despite airway remodeling induced by asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chhiba <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Green <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dolby <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Two recent studies treated primary bronchial epithelial cells with IL-13 and showed that this treatment resulted in significant decreases in SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bonser <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Morrison <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). No studies have investigated the impact of type 2 immunity on MERS-CoV or HCoV-NL63 infection.</p><p id="P7">To further understand HCoV infection in the nasal epithelium, we infected donor-matched nasal ALI cultures with three HCoVs: SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. These viruses represent both lethal and seasonal/common HCoVs, as well as alpha- and beta-coronaviruses. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 utilize the same cellular receptor for entry (ACE2), whereas MERS-CoV uses a different receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Raj <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cuervo and Grandvaux, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Castillo <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We first characterized viral replication, the impact of temperature on replication, and host cell tropism for each virus, and then evaluated the degree to which each HCoV induced cytotoxicity in the nasal epithelium. We then extended our studies of HCoV replication and induced cytotoxicity in the nose by infecting nasal ALI cultures with HCoV-229E, (another seasonal HCoV that utilizes a different receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yeager <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>). Finally, we treated nasal cultures with IL-13 to recapitulate an asthmatic airway and determined the impact of IL-13 on HCoV receptor abundance and replication. This comparative study seeks to further understand differences among HCoVs and how they interact with the host at the primary barrier site to infection, the nasal epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 replicate productively in nasal epithelial cultures</title><p id="P8">In order to compare the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 in the nasal epithelium, nasal air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from six independent donors were infected apically at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 plaque-forming units per cell (PFU/cell) with each virus, and cultures were incubated at 33°C to replicate the temperature of the nose <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Keck <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). At 48-hour intervals following viral inoculation, apical surface liquid (ASL) was collected, and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on VeroE6 (for SARS-CoV-2), VeroCCL81 (for MERS-CoV), or LLCMK2 (for HCoV-NL63) cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schildgen <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).

All three CoVs replicate productively in primary nasal cells, reaching peak viral titer at 96 hours post infection (hpi). SARS-CoV-2 replicates most robustly in these cultures, reaching peak viral titers on average ten-fold higher than either MERS-CoV or HCoV-NL63. Additionally, while both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV titers plateau and remain at peak levels at the 144hpi time point, HCoV-NL63 titers decrease after 96hpi.</p><p id="P9">In addition to these differences in average replication kinetics, within- and between-donor comparisons reveal further differences between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-D</xref> depict growth curves for each virus in nasal cultures derived from each donor. Donor-to-donor variability is most evident during MERS-CoV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), as it results in a bimodal replication phenotype. While nasal cultures derived from certain donors are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (donors 1374, 3459), those from other donors show minimal replication of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, those donors in which MERS-CoV replicated most efficiently (donors 1374, 3459) showed the least virus production for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and HCoV-NL63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Replication of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 but not MERS-CoV is modulated by temperature in nasal epithelial cultures</title><p id="P10">The physiologic temperature in the nasal cavity ranges from 25°C (at the nares) to 33°C (in the nasopharynx), which contrasts with that in the lung, which matches ambient body temperature, (37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Keck <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lindemann <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Given these temperature differences in the nose, we infected nasal ALI cultures at 33°C or 37°C with SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 and collected ASL as above to determine the impact of temperature on the replication of each virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Replication of HCoV-NL63 (at all time points) and SARS-CoV-2 (at the late time point, 144 hpi) was more efficient at 33°C (the temperature closer to that of the <italic>in vivo</italic> nasal epithelium) than at 37°C. This difference in replication was more robust for HCoV-NL63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), as its replication was almost completely ablated when infections were conducted at 37°C. For SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), replication was significantly higher at 33°C vs 37°C only at the late time point (144hpi), consistent with another report comparing SARS-CoV-2 replication in ALI cultures derived from the lower airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">V’kovski <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).

Antibodies against cilia marker type IV β-tubulin and mucin MUC5AC were used to identify ciliated cells and goblet cells, respectively. Infected regions within each ALI culture were identified using antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of each CoV. Among images obtained from nasal cultures derived from 12 independent donors, both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 primarily infect ciliated cells, while MERS-CoV predominantly infects non-ciliated goblet cells. Representative images for each virus are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. This pattern is consistent with the cellular receptors used by these viruses: SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 use the same receptor (ACE2) and thus infect the same cell type, while MERS-CoV uses DPP4.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>HCoVs differentially impact epithelial barrier integrity during infection of nasal epithelial cultures</title><p id="P12">To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 infection on epithelial barrier integrity in the nasal epithelium, nasal ALI cultures derived from 11 donors were infected with each virus, and an epithelial volt/ohm-meter (EVOM) instrument was used to measure trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in each culture prior to infection (0hpi) as well as at 96 and 192hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Srinivasan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Loss of epithelial integrity, tight junction dissolution, and other forms of damage to the epithelium result in decreases in TEER. To quantify global changes in epithelial barrier integrity throughout the course of infection with each virus, TEER values before infection were subtracted from TEER values at 192hpi and these values are plotted as ΔTEER in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. Each point in the scatterplot represents a single transwell culture, and the superimposed bars represent the average ΔTEER for each virus among triplicate cultures derived from all 11 donors. On average, both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 result in negative values for ΔTEER (decreases in epithelial barrier integrity with infection), while MERS-CoV infection results in positive values for ΔTEER, similar to the increase in TEER seen in mock-infected cultures following the differentiation period.

This contrasts with HCoV-NL63, which causes mild cytotoxicity at 96hpi (~20%) and significant cytotoxicity at 192hpi (~40%), as well as SARS-CoV-2, which causes minimal cytotoxicity at 96hpi but significant cytotoxicity at 192hpi (~40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). ASL at each time point evaluated for cytotoxicity was titered via plaque assay to confirm productive replication by all three viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Averaged cytotoxicity values at each time point among infected cultures derived from 11 donors are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>. Despite productive replication by all three CoVs, MERS-CoV does not induce any significant cytotoxicity, while SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 both induce significant cytotoxicity in the nasal epithelium. This is consistent with TEER findings, as decreases in TEER during infection were only observed following SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 infection (concurrently with cytotoxicity). We further compared LDH release in nasal cultures infected with WT MERS-CoV and the immune-stimulatory MERS-CoV mutant to determine if the lack of cytotoxicity seen during MERS-CoV infection was related to a lack of immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). The MERS-CoV mutant induced a slight but nonsignificant increase in cytotoxicity than WT MERS-CoV, corroborating our TEER findings.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>HCoV-229E replicates productively and causes significant cytotoxicity during infection of nasal ALI cultures</title><p id="P16">To further investigate differences among lethal and seasonal HCoVs in the nasal epithelium, we infected nasal ALI cultures derived from four donors with a second alpha genus HCoV associated with the common cold, HCoV-229E. Infections were conducted at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell, and apically-shed virus was titered at 96 and 192 hpi. HCoV-229E replicates robustly in nasal ALI cultures, reaching peak titers similar to those seen for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, HCoV-229E titers peak at 96hpi and decrease significantly at 192 hpi (~100-fold) in cultures derived from all four donors. This decline in viral titers at late time points is also observed during HCoV-NL63 infection, but not for SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). We measured TEER in these cultures at 96 and 192hpi. TEER values decreased, indicating damage to epithelial barrier integrity, in three of the four donors tested between 0 and 96hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, between 96 and 192hpi, TEER values increased in all four donors. This pattern is unique among the HCoVs evaluated in this study, as the defect in TEER in the majority of donors occurred earlier during infection (between 0 and 96hpi). TEER values for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 decreased most significantly between 96 and 192hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, 4D</xref>). ΔTEER values for HCoV-229E-infected cultures as well as mock-infected cultures are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, highlighting that changes in TEER during HCoV-229E infection occurred primarily between 0 and 96hpi. Finally, we measured cytotoxicity during infection with HCoV-229E via LDH quantification in ASL. Similar to the pattern seen for TEER, quantification, HCoV-229E induced a significant cytotoxicity signature (% cytotoxicity ranging from 10-40%, depending on the donor) at 96hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Later in infection at 192hpi, no detectable cytotoxicity was found following HCoV-229E infection. This cytotoxicity signature is consistent with the titers seen during HCoV-229E infection, as high viral titers at 96 hpi result in negative ΔTEER values and significant LDH release into ASL, whereas lower viral titers at 192 hpi are not associated with any defect in TEER or significant LDH signature. HCoV-229E infection of nasal ALI cultures results in productive replication and evidence of cytotoxicity (decrease in TEER and LDH detection in ASL) during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>IL-13 robustly influences cellular distribution and HCoV receptor abundance in the nasal epithelium</title><p id="P17">IL-13 is a type 2 cytokine implicated in allergy and asthma pathogenesis which causes marked goblet cell hyperplasia <italic>in vivo</italic> and in various ALI culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ordoñez <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Atherton <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kanoh, Tanabe and Rubin, 2011</xref>). We sought to determine how IL-13 impacts cellular makeup and HCoV receptor distribution in nasal ALI cultures. To do this, we compared cultures for which differentiation media had been supplemented with IL-13 every 48 hours during the final two weeks of differentiation (IL-13 condition) vs sham-treated cultures. Using RT-qPCR with primers specific for these viruses’ cellular receptors (DPP4 and ACE2), we found that <italic>DPP4</italic> mRNA expression levels increased between 100- and 1000-fold relative to sham-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), while expression of <italic>ACE2</italic> mRNA did not change significantly with IL-13 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). We next confirmed that IL-13 treatment of nasal ALI cultures resulted in goblet cell hyperplasia and that observed changes in RNA expression of <italic>DPP4</italic> were associated with increased DPP4 receptor abundance using an IF assay with antibodies against MUC5AC (goblet cell marker) and DPP4. Imaging of nasal ALI cultures derived from 10 total donors treated with IL-13 revealed marked increases in the numbers of cells positive for both MUC5AC and DPP4 via imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). DPP4 signal by immunofluorescence is very low at baseline (sham treatment). To confirm these findings, we collected protein lysates from mock-infected sham- and IL-13-treated cultures derived from 4 pooled donors, as well as from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63-infected cultures at 96hpi. Consistent with <italic>DPP4</italic> mRNA expression, DPP4 protein levels were undetectable by western blot in sham-treated cultures but present in all IL-13-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).

We also evaluated total type IV β-tubulin (ciliated cell marker) and MUC5AC levels (goblet cell marker), which showed reciprocal patterns with IL-13 treatment. MUC5AC protein levels increased with IL-13 treatment (further confirming goblet cell hyperplasia), while type IV β-tubulin protein levels decreased (suggesting that ciliated cells may diminish in number secondary to IL-13 treatment). These data demonstrate that IL-13 treatment has significant effects on cellular distribution (goblet vs ciliated cells) and receptor expression level (DPP4 for MERS-CoV, ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63) in nasal ALI cultures.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 replication is inhibited, while MERS-CoV replication increases, following IL-13 treatment of nasal ALI cultures</title><p id="P18">We next aimed to evaluate how IL-13 treatment and the resulting changes in HCoV receptor availability and cellular distribution impacted the replication of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. To do this, we treated donor-matched nasal ALI cultures derived from 10 donors (for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) or 7 donors (for HCoV-NL63) with IL-13 during the final two weeks of differentiation as above, infected at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell with each virus, and collected ASL at 48hpi and 96hpi for titration via plaque assay.

On average, both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 replicate less efficiently in IL-13-treated vs. sham-treated cultures. This phenotype is consistent with the cellular tropism and receptor expression for these viruses, as IL-13 treatment resulted in decreased ACE2 expression as well as decreased IV β-tubulin levels at the protein level via western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 replication decreased more dramatically than that of SARS-CoV-2 following IL-13 treatment, despite utilizing the same cellular receptor.

This nasal ALI system offers many advantages over the use of traditional epithelial cell lines to study HCoV replication. First, the use of differentiated nasal epithelial cells allows us to study virus-host dynamics at the primary barrier site encountered by respiratory viruses. Comparative studies of upper vs. lower respiratory tract cell lines (as well as primary culture systems) identify differences in permissiveness to viral infection as well as in host responses and transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need to study HCoVs in nasal cell models. Relatively few nasal epithelial cell lines are available, and the few that are (such as RPMI 2650, used as a model for chronic rhinosinusitis) have been shown to have limited response to inflammatory stimuli compared to primary nasal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ball <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Additionally, nasal ALIs express the cell types and mucociliary functions present in the nose, recreating the tissue environment and primary barriers encountered by HCoVs in the airway. Many groups have also shown that ALI systems like this one replicate the transcriptional profile of <italic>in vivo</italic> airway epithelia more closely than submerged culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pezzulo <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Prior studies have demonstrated that primary nasal epithelial cells are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is at least partially explained by the relatively high expression levels of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hou <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hatton <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gamage <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tran <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Notably, relatively few studies have taken a comparative approach to understand the diversity among HCoVs in their replication and concurrent host responses, and our work is the first to rigorously compare SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E in a nasal epithelial culture system. Most studies on MERS-CoV have focused on its replication in the lower respiratory tract, given its propensity to cause severe pneumonia; however, our data using nasal ALI cultures have demonstrated that MERS-CoV can productively replicate in the nasal epithelium, and, presumably, infection with MERS-CoV begins in the nose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">de Wit <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, as well as the other HCoVs typically associated with the common cold, have been remarkably under-studied. However, HCoV-NL63 is known to use the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2), and infection of bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells has shown that HCoV-NL63 replication is correlated with ACE2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Castillo <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Since all HCoVs enter and likely establish primary infections in the nasal epithelium, we hypothesized that understanding the diversity in HCoV-host dynamics in the nose may inform differences in disease phenotype as well as transmissibility among these viruses.</p><p id="P21">The main focus of our study was to directly compare SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. Titration of apically shed virus in donor-matched nasal epithelial cultures revealed that, while all three HCoVs replicate productively in the nasal epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 reaches the highest viral titers. This correlates with and may explain the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV, in which person-to-person transmission is far less common and has only been observed in settings such as hospital outbreaks and within households. As in other ALI culture systems, we observed some donor-to-donor variability in viral replication in our cultures. This was most evident during infection with MERS-CoV, which revealed a bimodal phenotype in which some donors were much more permissive to MERS-CoV replication than others. We hypothesize that this may be related to baseline variability in cell type composition and receptor expression in nasal cultures – i.e. cultures with an increased proportion of goblet cells and increased expression of MERS-CoV receptor (DPP4) are likely more permissive to infection by MERS-CoV. This donor-to-donor variability is another advantage of this primary culture system over immortalized cell lines, as HCoVs are often associated with a spectrum of clinical disease which is likely at least partially explained by heterogeneity in susceptibility and host responses.</p><p id="P22">Given the lower temperature typically found in the nasal airway (30-35°C rather than 37°C in the lower airway), we compared viral replication in nasal ALI cultures incubated at 33°C and 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Keck <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lindemann <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Temperature significantly impacted HCoV-NL63, and to some extent SARS-CoV-2, but did not impact MERS-CoV replication. Temperature-dependent differences in viral replication could be explained by differences in virion stability, viral replication efficiency, or host responses. It has been reported in the context of rhinovirus and various arbovirus infections that host innate immune responses are dampened at lower temperatures, suggesting that cooler temperatures may enable viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Foxman <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lane <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Biochemical studies on influenza virus have revealed that temperature can impact the stability of viral replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dalton <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). We are currently investigating the role of each of these factors in mediating the temperature-dependent differences in viral replication observed in nasal epithelial cultures.</p><p id="P23">To evaluate the degree of cytotoxicity induced during infection of the nasal epithelium with each HCoV, we quantified TEER as a readout for epithelial barrier integrity and LDH release as a marker for cellular damage. Decreases in TEER have been documented to occur secondary to various respiratory viral infections, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Smallcombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ruan et al., 2022</xref>). While both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 induced marked cytotoxicity in nasal ALI cultures, resulting in negative ΔTEER values (deterioration in epithelial barrier integrity) and significant LDH signal, MERS-CoV did not induce significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, MERS-CoV infection is not associated with significant upper respiratory tract symptomology, causing primarily severe lower respiratory tract disease (lethal pneumonia in more than 35% of cases). This contrasts with HCoV-NL63, typically associated with the common cold and primarily upper respiratory symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2, which is known to cause a wide range of disease from asymptomatic infections to mild colds to severe pneumonia. It is plausible that HCoV-mediated cytotoxicity in the case of mild SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 infections in the nasal epithelium may facilitate early viral clearance and limit the subsequent spread of viral infection to the lower airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ramasamy, 2022</xref>). Whereas limited cytotoxicity during MERS-CoV infection may allow for uninhibited spread to cause lower airway pathology.</p><p id="P24">Given the striking differences in cytotoxicity profiles observed during infection of nasal ALI cultures among these three HCoVs, we extended these studies by including another common cold-associated HCoV (HCoV-229E). HCoV-229E replicates robustly in the nasal epithelium, reaching peak titers similar to those seen for SARS-CoV-2, but its overall replication kinetics differ, as a sharp decline in apically shed virus is observed at late time points. This decline in viral titer is also observed for HCoV-NL63 at very late time points, suggesting it may be a common feature during infection of nasal epithelial cells with seasonal HCoVs. HCoV-229E induced cytotoxicity during infection of nasal ALI cultures – indicated by negative ΔTEER values and LDH detected in apical fluid – but this cytotoxicity signature was completely resolved at the very late time point (192hpi).</p><p id="P25">This diverged from the pattern seen for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, which both induced increasing cytotoxicity as infection progressed. The cytotoxicity pattern for HCoV-229E is consistent with its replication cycle, as peak viral titers occur simultaneously with both markers of cytotoxicity, and the decline in viral titer later in infection is accompanied by resolution of cytotoxicity. We speculate that this pattern may indicate clearance or resolution of infection with HCoV-229E, allowing infected nasal ALI cultures to return to a baseline or healthy state. The overall cytotoxicity profile for HCoV-229E is also consistent with its typical clinical phenotype, as it is associated with upper respiratory tract pathology and symptoms. Thus, we expect to see markers of cytotoxicity during infection of nasal ALI cultures with HCoV-229E, as was observed during SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 infection. However, the kinetics of cytotoxicity induction by HCoV-229E are unique, suggesting additional differences among these HCoVs in terms of host responses and resolution of infection by the host.</p><p id="P26">Cytotoxicity during HCoV infection of the nasal airway is likely induced both by cellular remodeling as a byproduct of viral replication and by host immune/stress responses secondary to viral sensing. Nasal epithelial cells express high basal levels of antiviral interferon (IFN) response genes and thus may be primed for response to invading viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hatton <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We previously showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mild IFN responses in nasal ALI cultures, whereas MERS-CoV adeptly shuts down this host innate immune pathway unless its immune antagonist Endoribonuclease U (nsp15) and subgenera-specific accessory genes are mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Comar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The degree of innate immune induction during HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229E infection is unknown. Thus, future work in nasal ALI cultures will investigate the role that innate immune induction by HCoVs may have on their contrasting cytotoxicity profiles. There is evidence that early immune responses can mediate control of viral infections and prevention of spread to the lower airway. The host factor IFN-lambda is thought to play a particularly important role in these early defenses, as infection of mice defective in IFN-lambda with influenza results in an inability to control infection in the upper airway and dissemination to the lower airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Klinkhammer <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The protective role of IFN-lambda has just begun to be studied during HCoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chong <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). A recent study investigated potential mechanisms for the relative protection against developing severe COVID-19 seen in children compared to adults and revealed that pediatric airways showed higher basal expression levels of relevant immune sensors such as MDA5, which detects CoV double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Loske <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, our observations of HCoV-229E suggest that even among the seasonal HCoVs, there may be significant differences in the ability of host responses to resolve viral infections. Differences in early cytotoxicity secondary to viral replication as well as degree of immune evasion in the nasal epithelium may be key factors that determine disease severity.</p><p id="P27">Finally, we treated nasal ALI cultures with type 2 cytokine IL-13 to induce goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Type 2 cytokines are known to play important roles in asthma and allergy pathogenesis, and recent clinical association studies have shown that asthmatics may be less prone to developing severe COVID-19. Our findings highlight how host factors such as baseline tissue microenvironment (i.e. goblet cell hyperplasia) can have significant impacts on HCoV receptor availability and resulting HCoV replication after infection. IL-13 treatment significantly increased MERS-CoV replication but decreased SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 replication. Our findings are consistent with two recent reports that investigated the impact of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 replication in a lower airway ALI culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bonser <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Morrison <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our findings are also consistent with the clinical association studies that suggest asthmatic patients are resistant to severe COVID-19, likely secondary to baseline goblet cell hyperplasia, reduction in ACE2 expression, and diminished SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Green <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We hypothesize that asthmatic patients would be highly susceptible to severe MERS-CoV infection, as MERS-CoV primarily infects goblet cells, and asthmatic airways typically express higher than normal levels of DPP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Raj <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shiobara <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The opposite is likely true for HCoV-NL63, since ACE2 levels have been shown to be a key predictor of susceptibility to HCoV-NL63 infection, so asthmatic patients are likely at reduced risk of contracting HCoV-NL63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Castillo <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This nasal ALI culture system can thus be used as a tool to mimic human disease phenotypes and determine the impact of a disease on HCoV-host dynamics. In addition to IL-13 treatment to recapitulate an asthmatic/allergic airway, ALI cultures could be grown from pediatric and adult patients to further understand differences in HCoV replication and immune responses related to age. Similarly, ALI cultures derived from patients with respiratory diseases like cystic fibrosis could be used to determine relative risk profiles for these patients for these and future emerging respiratory viruses.</p><p id="P28">Given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the likelihood of emergence of additional pathogenic HCoVs in the future, it is imperative to understand CoV-host interactions to inform the development of effective antivirals and vaccines. Comparative studies using primary airway culture systems are particularly important to reveal diversity among HCoVs in terms of replication and host responses which are likely key predictors in pathogenesis and transmissibility. We are currently extending our work with this nasal ALI culture system to expand our findings to other HCoVs associated with the common cold, as well as to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Nasal air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures</title><p id="P29">Nasal mucosal specimens were obtained via cytologic brushing of patients in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Division of Rhinology at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center after obtaining informed consent.

In brief: transwells were placed into the Endohm-6 measurement chamber with PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium (cmPBS) in the basal compartment and 200 μL of cmPBS in the apical compartment. TEER measurements were converted to Ohms-cm^2 based on the surface area of the transwell inserts.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Lactate dehydrogenase assay</title><p id="P35">Apical fluid samples collected in PBS were assayed for cytotoxicity via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. LDH release was quantified using an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apical fluid collected from mock-infected nasal cultures was used to subtract background signal. Percentage cytotoxicity was calculated relative to ceiling LDH release values (quantified from cultures treated with Triton-X 100).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p id="P36">Cells were lysed at indicated time points with buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen RNeasy Plus) and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the High Capacity Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems). This cDNA was amplified using specific qRT-PCR primers for each target gene, iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and the QuantStudio 3 PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Primer sequences were as follows: 18S (Fwd: TTCGATGGTAGTCGCTGTGC, Rev: CTGCTGCCTTCCTTGAATGTGGTA); ACE2 (Fwd: AGAACCCTGGACCCTAGCAT, Rev: AGTCGGTACTCCATCCCACA); DPP4 (Fwd: GAAAGGTGTCAGTACTATTCTGTGT, Rev: CCAGGACTCTCAGCCCTTTATC). ΔCt values were calculated using the formula ΔCt = Ct<sub>gene of interest</sub> Ct<sub>18S</sub>. Δ(ΔCt) were calculated by subtracting sham-treated ΔCt values from ΔCt values for IL-13-treated cultures. Technical triplicates were averaged, and changes in mRNA levels were reported as fold changes over sham-treated cultures, using the formula 2<sup>-Δ(ΔCt)</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Western blotting</title><p id="P37">Cell lysates were harvested at indicated time points with RIPA buffer (50mM Tris pH 8, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche: cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche: PhosStop easy pack). Lysates were harvested via scraping of the transwell insert and incubated on ice for 20 minutes, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 RPM at 4°C, and the supernatant was mixed 3:1 with 4X Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes, then separated via SDS/PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked in either 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in TBST and probed with antibodies as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>. Blots were visualized using Thermo Scientific SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (catalog # 34096). Blots were stripped using Thermo Scientific Restore Western Blot stripping buffer (catalog #21059) for one hour at room temperature and then probed sequentially with antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplemntal tables and figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS155998-supplement-supplemntal_tables_and_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Weiss lab for feedback and discussion of this project, Dr. Nikki Tannetti for reading the manuscript, and Dr. Anthony Fehr for construction of the MERS-nsp15/ΔNS4a mutant.

Dotted lines connect the average cytotoxicity among all 4 donors for each HCoV. *** indicates average cytotoxicity in SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 infected cultures is significantly higher than that of MERS-CoV infected cultures at 192 hpi (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 by two-way ANOVA). No comparisons reached significance at 96 hpi. Data from 4 donors shown here is representative of LDH data from infected cultures derived from 11 total donors. (B-C) ASL from the 4 donors in (A) was titered via viral plaque assay to confirm productive replication of each virus in these cultures. (D) % cytotoxicity values from infected cultures derived from all 11 donors were averaged and reported as mean ± SD for each virus. (E) % cytotoxicity values from duplicate cultures derived from 4 donors and infected with WT MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV recombinant (MERS-CoV-nsp15<sup>H231A</sup>/ΔNS4A), reported as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of average % cytotoxicity values for each virus was compared at each time point via two-way ANOVA: ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001. Comparisons that did not reach significance are denoted ns.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155998-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>HCoV-229E replicates in nasal cultures and induces an early cytotoxicity signature.</title><p>Nasal ALI cultures derived from 4 donors were infected in duplicate with HCoV-229E at MOI = 5 PFU/cell and ASL collected at 0, 96, and 192 hpi. (A) HCoV-229E viral titers determined via plaque assay, reported as mean ± SD for each of the 4 donors. (B) TEER measured prior to infection (0 hpi), as well as at 96 and 192 hpi, is plotted for each transwell infected with HCoV-229E to track TEER changes over time. Transwells derived from the same donor are color-coded according to the donor number key to the right. (C) ΔTEER values for each HCoV-229E infected culture were calculated by subtracting TEER at baseline from 96hpi TEER values (96-0), subtracting TEER at baseline from 192hpi TEER values (192-0), or by subtracting 96 hpi TEER values from 192 hpi TEER values (192-96). Each point represents ΔTEER calculated from a single transwell, with bars indicating average ΔTEER for that time point comparison. (D) ASL was used for LDH quantification to determine % cytotoxicity relative to nasal cultures treated with Triton X-100 (ceiling). Each point represents the average % cytotoxicity from duplicate transwells from each donor, and the overall average % cytotoxicity is shown with bars.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155998-f006"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>IL-13 treatment of nasal epithelial cultures impacts HCoV receptor abundance and cellular distribution.</title><p>(A-B) Uninfected nasal ALI cultures derived from 3 donors were sham-treated or treated with IL-13 in triplicate for the final 2 weeks of differentiation, and total RNA was harvested and expression of <italic>DPP4</italic> (A) and <italic>ACE2</italic> (B) mRNA was quantified by RT-qPCR and expressed as fold change over sham-treated cultures using the 2<sup>-Δ(Δ<italic>CT</italic>)</sup> formula.
