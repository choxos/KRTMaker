The transmembrane mucin MUC13 is an abundant intestinal glycoprotein with important functions for mucosal maintenance that are not yet completely understood. We demonstrate that in intestinal epithelial monolayers MUC13 localized to both the apical surface and the tight junction (TJ) region on the lateral membrane. MUC13 deletion resulted in increased transepithelial resistance (TEER) and reduced translocation of small solutes. TJ proteins including claudins and occludin were highly increased in membrane fractions of MUC13 knockout cells. Removal of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail (CT) also altered TJ composition but did not result in increased TEER. The increased buildup of TJ complexes in ΔMUC13 and MUC13-ΔCT cells was dependent on PKC, which is in line with a predicted PKC motif in the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail. The responsible PKC member might be PKCδ based on elevated protein levels in the absence of MUC13. Our results identify MUC13 as a central player in TJ complex stability and intestinal barrier permeability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intestinal barrier function</kwd><kwd>transmembrane mucin</kwd><kwd>cell-bound mucin</kwd><kwd>paracellular 26 permeability</kwd><kwd>tight junctions</kwd><kwd>claudin-1</kwd><kwd>claudin-3</kwd><kwd>claudin-4</kwd><kwd>PKCδ</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The intestinal epithelial barrier is a dynamic system that prevents bacterial invasion while at the same time allowing the transport of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The intestinal mucosal epithelium consists of various types of enterocytes and a closely associated mucus layer in which highly glycosylated mucin proteins are the main structural component. Mucins can be categorized into soluble mucins that are secreted by goblet cells and transmembrane (TM) mucins that are cell-bound and expressed by most types of enterocytes. TM mucins expressed in the human intestinal tract include MUC1, MUC3, MUC12, MUC13, and MUC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) of which MUC13 shows the most widespread expression along the different segments of the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The extracellular domains of TM mucins are highly glycosylated and their cytoplasmic tails have signaling capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). TM mucins are highly diverse, and the different members have been implicated in fundamental epithelial processes including the regulation of cell-cell interactions, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and modulation of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Dysfunction of TM mucins has been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Reduced intestinal barrier function and the translocation of bacterial components across the intestinal mucosal-epithelial barrier are hallmarks of IBD. The contributions of specific TM mucins to epithelial barrier integrity and development of IBD remain to be established.</p><p id="P3">MUC13 is a relatively small TM mucin that consists of a glycosylated extracellular domain (ED) that contains a Sperm protein, Enterokinase, and Agrin (SEA) domain, three epithelial growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a cytoplasmic tail (CT) with putative phosphorylation sites. Previous studies demonstrated MUC13 expression on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells, and cytoplasmic and nuclear localization was observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and during metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). MUC13 mRNA expression is upregulated in the inflamed colon in IBD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and a mutation in the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail was shown to be associated with the development of UC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The function of MUC13 seems to be multifaceted as it has been linked to different aspects of mucosal maintenance and inflammation. Overall, most MUC13-associated phenotypes can be considered pro-inflammatory and promote wound healing and tumorigenesis. MUC13 enhances the epithelial pro-inflammatory response to bacterial ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) thereby promoting TNF-induced NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Muc13-deficient mice and human intestinal MUC13 knockdown cells are more sensitive to toxin-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Single-cell migration is enhanced in colon cancer cells with MUC13 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, MUC13 interacts with HER2 resulting in activation and cytoskeletal remodeling, growth, motility, and invasive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Thus, MUC13 seems to be a key protein that is linked to several aspects of intestinal epithelial health and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be resolved.</p><p id="P5">Epithelial barrier integrity is critically regulated by the junction complexes that are embedded in the lateral membranes of neighboring cells. The junction complexes can be divided into adherence junctions (AJ), tight junctions (TJ), and desmosomes. Together, they form the apical junctional complex which seals the paracellular space between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). TJ are large multimeric protein complexes in the lateral membrane that consist of various transmembrane proteins, including occludin and claudins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The main function of TJs is the regulation of paracellular permeability, but they also play a role in polarization, morphogenesis, cell proliferation, and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Intracellularly, proteins such as ZO-1 connect the TJ complex to the actin cytoskeleton and signal transduction molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). AJ and desmosomes are present along the full length of the lateral membrane, connecting adjacent cells, and contribute to the barrier function without sealing the paracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The main structural protein of AJs is E-cadherin. Through its intracellular tail, E-cadherin interacts with β-catenin, the central regulator of the epithelial WNT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Changes in barrier function and TJ and AJ proteins are often observed in IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Multiple members of the TM mucin family have been implicated in the regulation of cell-cell interactions. MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 all reduce the interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin at the membrane, thereby promoting β-catenin translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). MUC1 and MUC16 can interact directly with β-catenin via the phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), whereas MUC13 can enhance nuclear translocation of β-catenin through interaction with GSK-3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Several studies have linked MUC1, MUC16, and MUC17 with alterations in TJ proteins, thereby influencing epithelial monolayer properties, though the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Whether MUC13 regulates TJ proteins and epithelial barrier integrity is yet unknown.</p><p id="P7">In the present study, we investigate the function of MUC13 in the regulation of barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium. Our data identify MUC13 as a central regulator of tight junction strength and paracellular passage which has important implications for the role of this TM mucin in IBD and colorectal cancer development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MUC13 is highly expressed in the intestinal tract and localizes to the apical and lateral membrane</title><p id="P8">To determine the expression of MUC13 and other mucin genes in different segments and cell types of the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the gut atlas single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gutcellatlas.org/">gutcellatlas.org</ext-link>). This dataset contains 428,000 intestinal cells from fetal, pediatric, and adult donors. We focused on the adult cells and extracted the average expression of the different transmembrane and soluble mucins from each part of the gastrointestinal tract. MUC13 was expressed in at least 50% of the cells across all locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). MUC3A was also detected in all segments but the expression was lower in the appendix and rectum. MUC1 and MUC4 expression was mainly observed in the colon and rectum, while MUC17 showed the opposite pattern with high expression in the small intestine. We then analyzed the dataset for mucin expression within different cell type lineages. As expected, high expression of the secreted mucin MUC2 was observed for goblet cells. Transmembrane mucins MUC1 and MUC4 were also highly expressed in goblet cells. A comparable expression pattern was found for MUC13 and MUC3A with high expression throughout all cell types with the highest levels in enterocytes and BEST4+ epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">MUC13 has been reported to localize to the apical surface of differentiated intestinal epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). We determined the expression and localization of MUC13 in intestinal epithelial HRT18 and Caco-2 cells. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed with a MUC13 antibody directed against the cytoplasmic tail. With this antibody, the majority of MUC13 was detected on the lateral membranes of both HRT18 and Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). By creating Z-stacks, we observed MUC13 staining from the apical side of the lateral membrane towards the middle and limited or no staining in the basal planes which depict the lower region of the lateral membrane. The tight junction protein occludin also localized to the top half of the lateral membrane, similar to MUC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Staining of the adherence junction protein E-cadherin was observed along the entire lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Using a previously described method for transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), we generated a novel monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of MUC13. This antibody stained both the apical surface and upper part of the lateral membrane in HRT18 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that different MUC13 antibodies recognize distinct MUC13 populations on the apical and lateral membranes. We conclude that MUC13 localizes to the apical surface of enterocytes and the apical side of the lateral membrane in the region where tight junctions are found.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deletion of MUC13 and targeted deletion of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail using CRISPR/Cas9</title><p id="P10">To study the function of the full-length MUC13 protein and the contribution of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail, we designed CRISPR/Cas9 strategies to generate two types of HRT18 MUC13 knockout cell lines. Expression of the full-length MUC13 protein was eliminated by deletion of 380 base pairs in the second exon which resulted in disruption of the reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). As a control, HRT18 cells were transduced with an empty CRISPR plasmid without guide RNAs, and the resulting cell line was used in all the experiments as accompanying wild type (HRT18-WT). For targeted removal of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail, we selected gRNAs that target exon 10 and were predicted to result in the removal of 121 bp that encode the majority of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). For all genotypes, we generated two independent cell lines resulting in two HRT18-WT (WT 1 and 2), two HRT18-ΔMUC13 (ΔMUC13 1 and 2), and two HRT18-MUC13-ΔCT cell lines (MUC13-ΔCT 1 and 2). The domain structures of the MUC13 WT and ΔCT proteins are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, and the amino acid sequence of each domain is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>. The resulting deletion and disrupted reading frame of the different cell lines were confirmed by PCR and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The two ΔMUC13 cell lines lacked 300 and 377 bp fragments, respectively. Both MUC13-ΔCT clones had a deletion of 121 bp resulting in a stop codon three amino acids after the deletion. The predicted sequence of the remaining cytoplasmic tail is ARSNNKTKHIEEENLIDEDFQNLKLRSIR*, which lacks multiple putative phosphorylation sites and a predicted PKC motif that are present in the full-length cytoplasmic tail.</p><p id="P11">Next, we investigated the expression of MUC13 or the truncated protein in HRT18-WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT cells. Western blot analysis with the MUC13-CT antibody showed MUC13-reactive bands of 120 kDa and 130 kDa in the WT cell lines, which were absent in ΔMUC13 and MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). A slightly different molecular weight was observed for MUC13 in the two WT cell lines which could be the result of differential glycosylation or processing and/or activation by (auto)proteolytic cleavage as has been reported for MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). MUC13 expression in the different cell lines was also investigated by confocal microscopy. With the antibody directed against the cytoplasmic tail, we observed lateral membrane staining in HRT18-WT cells, while the signal was absent in ΔMUC13 and MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). With the antibody directed against the extracellular domain, we observed apical and lateral staining in WT cells, but not in ΔMUC13 cells. For the MUC13-ΔCT 1 cell line, we noted reduced intensity staining of the extracellular domain compared to the WT cells, while the extracellular domain was barely detectible in the MUC13-ΔCT 2 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results demonstrate that while they are genetically identical, expression levels differ between the two ΔCT cell lines which might be due to reduced stability of the truncated MUC13 protein. We conclude that our CRISPR-Cas9 strategy in the intestinal epithelial HRT18 cells was successful and resulted in MUC13 knockout cell lines and cell lines that express MUC13 without the cytoplasmic tail.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation of MUC13-GFP overexpression and complementation cell lines</title><p id="P12">To complement MUC13 in the knockout cell lines, we cloned a doxycycline-inducible MUC13-GFP plasmid with a codon-optimized MUC13 DNA sequence that left the amino acid sequence unaltered but allowed cloning and expression. Lentiviral transduction was used to introduce the MUC13-GFP construct into HRT18 wild type and ΔMUC13 cells resulting in overexpression WT+pMUC13 and complemented ΔMUC13+pMUC13 cell lines. Doxycycline induction resulted in MUC13-GFP expression in at least 50% of the total cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Deletion of MUC13 alters epithelial barrier properties</title><p id="P13">To investigate the contribution of MUC13 to epithelial barrier properties, we grew the HRT18 cell lines for two weeks to allow the buildup of cell junctions. Cells reached full confluency on day 3. To determine the monolayer architecture, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy and stained for occludin, E-cadherin, and nuclei (DAPI). All cell lines formed confluent monolayers with comparable occludin and E-cadherin staining. ΔMUC13 cells did show a less rounded cell morphology compared to WT and MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Next, confluent monolayers were grown on membranes in Transwell plates and differentiated for 14 days. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of TJ strength based on electrical resistance, was determined over time for all cell lines. The TEER of ΔMUC13 clones was, on average, three-times higher compared to WT cells while the TEER of the MUC13-ΔCT cells was comparable to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that differences in TEER were caused by differences in cell numbers, we counted the number of nuclei per plane after 14 days of differentiation. The numbers of nuclei were comparable between the cell lines, indicating that the difference in TEER was not a result of differences in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Next, we determined the buildup of TEER in the MUC13 overexpression and complementation cell lines WT+pMUC13 and ΔMUC13+pMUC13. Overexpression of MUC13-GFP in the ΔMUC13 background led to a significant reduction of TEER buildup over time, while overexpression in the wild type background did not affect TEER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that MUC13 negatively regulates TEER buildup.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MUC13 deletion leads to decreased paracellular passage of small molecules</title><p id="P14">TEER reflects the conductance of small ions via the paracellular pathway, which represents the passage of molecules through the intercellular spaces between adjacent epithelial cells. The flux of larger molecules through the paracellular pathways can be addressed using organic tracers, such as Lucifer Yellow CH and fluoresceinated (FITC)-dextran particles. We seeded our cell lines on Transwell membranes as before and the transfer of compounds from the apical compartment to the basolateral side was determined. WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT cells were all highly restrictive for the passage of 4 and 70 kDa FITC-dextran particles. For the smaller 520 Da Lucifer Yellow tracer, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT monolayers were restrictive while WT cells were permeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Because translocation of bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) across the intestinal barrier is an important hallmark of intestinal barrier dysfunction, we determined the passage of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS-EB). A maximum of ∼300 ng/μL LPS reached the basal compartment after 24 hours incubation for the control wells, and less than 0.1 ng/μL LPS passage for the different HRT18 cell lines. LPS passage was comparable between WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT cell lines indicating the restrictiveness of these cells to the passage of larger particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). In summary, we observed that deletion of MUC13 results in a higher buildup of TEER and lower paracellular passage of the small organic solute Lucifer Yellow compared to WT. The TEER of the MUC13-ΔCT cell line was comparable to WT, but a significant restriction of Lucifer Yellow passage compared to WT was observed. We conclude that the paracellular pathway is altered in both MUC13 deletion cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Epithelial barrier strengthening by <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> is independent of MUC13</title><p id="P15">To investigate the role of MUC13 in TEER regulation, we made use of a probiotic bacterium known to enhance TEER formation. <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (LP) is a commensal of the large intestine that can enhance intestinal barrier function by activating Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling which triggers the translocation of occludin and ZO-1 to the TJ region in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). LP was added to 14 days-differentiated WT and ΔMUC13 cell monolayers at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. TEER was measured every 12 h for two days and the largest increase was observed 42 h after the addition of the bacteria. The incubation with LP resulted in a comparable increase in TEER in WT and ΔMUC13 cells by 2.2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). To confirm that the increase in TEER was not due to increased cell counts we confirmed that the number of nuclei per plane at 42 h post-infection was comparable between the different cell lines and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). These data show that the increase in epithelial barrier properties in response to LP is not dependent on MUC13. The function of MUC13 in epithelial barrier regulation seems therefore not linked to the pathway of TLR-mediated increase of ZOs and occludin proteins induced by LP.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Tight junction proteins are highly upregulated in the absence of MUC13</title><p id="P16">Based on the TEER and translocation data, we hypothesized that ΔMUC13 cells might have stronger tight junctions that reduce the paracellular translocation of ions and small particles. The functional fraction of junction proteins localizes to the plasma membrane. To be able to detect this functional fraction with increased sensitivity, we developed a fractionation protocol to enrich for the membrane fractions of WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We verified the fractionation strategy by Western blot with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (as membrane marker), Histone-H3 (as nuclear marker), and β-actin (as cytoplasmic marker). Membrane fractions showed a successful enrichment of membrane proteins and were free of nuclear contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Next to the validation by Western blotting, we further analyzed the membrane fractions by mass spectrometry. From three technical replicates, a total of 4.054 proteins were identified, of which 3.916 proteins were quantifiable in at least two out of three replicates.</p><p id="P17">Within this group of identified proteins, 1.189 proteins had at least one membrane annotation, suggesting that the ultracentrifugation significantly enriched the membrane fractions and was important in increasing the coverage of plasma membrane and plasma membrane-recruited proteins. Upon data normalization, the intensity of the marker protein Na+/K+-ATPase was consistent between samples and biological replicates, demonstrating stringent and reproducible membrane profiling across different MUC13 mutant lines. By quantitative comparison of WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT membranes by mass spectrometry, we observed a striking increase in junction proteins, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>. The TJ proteins occludin, tricellulin, ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and several claudins (claudins-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, and -12) were found at higher levels in ΔMUC13 membranes compared to WT membranes. We also noted an upregulation of the AJ proteins E-cadherin, β-catenin, and Cadherin-17 in ΔMUC13 membranes compared to WT membranes, though this difference was less pronounced than the upregulation of TJ proteins. In the membranes of the MUC13-ΔCT cell lines, ZO-1 and claudins-1 and -2 were consistently more abundant compared to WT membranes. The identified major tight junctions’ alterations in the ΔMUC13 and MUC13-ΔCT cell lines could underly the observed restriction of the paracellular pathway upon deletion of MUC13 or removal of its cytoplasmic tail.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>The degradation rate of tight junction proteins is not affected by MUC13</title><p id="P18">TJs are dynamic complexes in which proteins can be added and removed at different rates and quantities via vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).

To assess the turnover of TJ proteins, monolayers were incubated with sulfo-NHS SS-biotin to label all extracellularly exposed proteins, including tight junction proteins. Cells were harvested after 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days of incubation. Biotinylated proteins were isolated from whole-cell lysates with streptavidin beads and analyzed by Western blot with specific antibodies. As before, the TJ proteins were more abundant in the ΔMUC13 cells than in WT and MUC13-ΔCT cells. In WT and MUC13-ΔCT cells, biotinylated occludin was lost after 1 day while it was still detectable in ΔMUC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Also, claudin-1 and claudin-4 were detectable for a longer period in ΔMUC13 cells compared to WT. However, quantification demonstrated that the possibility to detect proteins at day 1 was caused by the higher starting concentration, since an equal degradation rate was seen for the TJ proteins occludin, claudins-1, and claudin-4, as well as of the AJ protein E-cadherin in WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data indicate that the rate of degradation of tight junction proteins is comparable between the different cell lines, and that the increased levels of junction proteins are not due to reduced degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Total tight junction protein abundance is increased in the absence of MUC13</title><p id="P19">To investigate whether these changes result from increased total expression or selective recruitment to the plasma membrane, we analyzed the abundance of selected junction proteins in the total lysates of the different cell lines by immunoblot. An upregulation of occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1, and claudin-4 was detected in ΔMUC13 lysates, whereas MUC13-ΔCT lysates displayed increased levels of occludin and claudins-1 and -4 compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the increased accumulation of TJ proteins at the membrane of ΔMUC13 and MUC13-ΔCT cell lines are the result of higher total protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>TEER buildup in the absence of MUC13 is dependent on MLCK, ROCK, and PKC kinases</title><p id="P20">The assembly, disassembly, and maintenance of TJs are known to be regulated by the kinases Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK), Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), and members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). MLCK, ROCK, and PKCs are all involved in the phosphorylation of MLC2, a key protein in the contraction and relaxation of the perijunctional actomyosin ring, a mechanism needed for TEER formation. In addition, PKC members phosphorylate different TJ proteins resulting in enhanced stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). For inhibition of the three kinases, we selected inhibitors ML-7 (MLCK), Y-27632 (ROCK), and GF-109293X (PKC). WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT cell lines were grown for 14 days in the presence of inhibitors added on days 3, 6, and 9. The inhibitors did not have a significant effect on the TEER of WT or MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D, F</xref>). In ΔMUC13 cells, on the other hand, the enhanced TEER buildup was not taking place in the presence of any of the three inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). These results suggest that all three kinases are essential for the increased TEER buildup in the absence of the full-length MUC13.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>The effect of MUC13 on TJs is mediated by PKC proteins</title><p id="P21">We used the NetPhos-3.1 software to predict putative phosphorylation sites in the MUC13 tail and found two putative PKC binding motifs. The first motif (-VTARS-) has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Because this motif is situated directly adjacent to the MUC13 transmembrane domain, accessibility for PKC binding seems unlikely. The second putative PKC site -RITASRDSQ- is further removed from the transmembrane domain (amino acid residues 488-496). The truncated MUC13-ΔCT still contains the -VTARS- motif, but the -RITASRDSQ- motif is absent due to the cytoplasmic tail deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To further investigate the contribution of PKC to the MUC13-related TJ phenotype, we investigated the protein expression levels of PKC isotypes PKCα and PKCδ. PKCα expression was comparable between the cell lines, but PKCδ levels were increased in the ΔMUC13 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). These data suggest a functional link between MUC13 and PKCδ but do not conclusively establish a connection with the PKC motif in the cytoplasmic tail. We next collected membrane fractions from WT, ΔMUC13, and MUC13-ΔCT monolayers differentiated in the absence and presence of the PKC inhibitor GF-109293X. PKC inhibition clearly resulted in reduced expression of barrier-forming claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in the ΔMUC13 membrane fractions, and some reductions were observed in WT and MUC13-ΔCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Quantification of claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in three independent experiments demonstrated a significant reduction of claudin-3 and claudin-4 in membrane fractions of the ΔMUC13 monolayers, while the other differences were not significantly reduced. These data demonstrate that deletion of MUC13 promotes TEER buildup through increased synthesis and accumulation of TJ proteins in a PKC-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">MUC13 is one of the most ubiquitously expressed transmembrane mucins in the intestinal tract, but the role of MUC13 in intestinal health and disease is not fully understood. This study explores the contribution of MUC13 to the development of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. We provide evidence that MUC13 negatively regulates the assembly of TJ complexes and regulates the paracellular transport of small solutes. The increase in TEER observed in MUC13 knockout cells requires the signaling molecule PKC.</p><p id="P24">One of the main functions of mucins is to protect the mucosal epithelium and underlying tissues against luminal agents. In addition, the modulation of cell-cell interactions seems to be a general trait of transmembrane mucins. Several TM mucins have been implicated in the regulation of AJ proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin, namely MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), MUC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), MUC13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and MUC16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Additionally, mucin knockdown studies demonstrated the roles of several TM mucins in the regulation of TJ proteins. Silencing of MUC1 in human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B led to reduced levels of occludin and claudin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). MUC16 knockdown in human corneal cells resulted in disruption of ZO-1 and occludin proteins, decreased TEER, and increased dye and bacterial penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). MUC17 silencing in Caco-2 and HT29-19A cells resulted in a profound reduction of occludin and ZO-1 levels and an increase in paracellular permeability after infection with enteroinvasive <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EIEC) when compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). In contrast to MUC1, MUC16, and MUC17 which positively regulate tight junction proteins, our study shows, for the first time, a transmembrane mucin (MUC13) that negatively regulates TJs and epithelial barrier integrity.</p><p id="P25">One of the most important functions of the intestinal epithelium is to transport nutrients and water to the mucosal tissues, while preventing the diffusion of toxins, allergens, and inflammatory molecules, such as LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). The overall tightness or leakiness of a cell layer depends on the tight junction composition within the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We discovered that the removal of MUC13 causes an increased accumulation of claudins at the cell membrane, including claudins-1, -2, -3, -4, - 7, and -12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This group contains one pore-forming claudin (claudin-2), one claudin with yet unknown barrier effect (claudin-12), and is dominated by the barrier-forming claudins-1, -3, -4, and - 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), together resulting in the phenotypic buildup of TEER in ΔMUC13 cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Deletion of just the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail was sufficient to increase the accumulation of claudins-1, -2, -3, and -4. Besides ions and water, TJ proteins can regulate the paracellular flux of bigger particles through the “leak pathway”. Occludin and tricellulin have been shown to regulate the transepithelial flux of particles of various sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). In our study, all three tested intestinal cell lines were highly restrictive for the passage of large particles, including LPS and FITC-dextran of 4 kDa and 70 kDa, but WT cells were permeable to the 520 Da Lucifer Yellow tracer while MUC13 knockout cells were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). Together, our results show that, in the absence of a fully functional MUC13, there is a reduction in the passage of ions and small-sized particles to deeper layers of the intestinal tissue. Alterations in ion fluxes through the paracellular channels have been described to lead to a dysfunctional intestinal barrier, causing diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Our observations about the link between MUC13 and TJs shed a new light on previous reports showing alterations of TJ proteins in IBD patients. The main TJ proteins occludin and tricellulin, together with sealing claudins (such as claudins-3, -4, -5, -7, and -8) are downregulated in colonic and rectal tissue of IBD patients, while claudin-1 and the pore-forming claudin-2 are upregulated leading to reduced barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). The negative regulation of intestinal barrier MUC13 that we observe in our model may in part explain the loss of intestinal integrity in IBD patients.</p><p id="P26">The effect of MUC13 deletion on claudin expression at the membrane does not depend on altered turnover of TJ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>), but rather requires kinases known to be involved in the buildup of TJs. We found that MLCK and ROCK are necessary to build up the TJ complexes and TEER in ΔMUC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). These kinases are known to control the contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring and subsequent paracellular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Moreover, members of the PKC family have been implicated in the regulation of many different TJ proteins as they are responsible for the phosphorylation of claudins (Franke et al., 2010; Yoo et al., 2003; Banan et al., 2005; González-Mariscal et al., 2008, 2010), occludin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Our study demonstrates that PKC activity is needed to accumulate high levels of claudins at the membrane of all three cell lines but is especially important in ΔMUC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). The MUC13 cytoplasmic tail contains several potential phosphorylation sites (8 serine and 2 tyrosine residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and two putative PKC motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). We observed that in the absence of the full-length MUC13, the total levels of PKCδ are increased but deletion of the cytoplasmic tail alone did not evidently increase PKCδ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). On the other hand, PKC inhibition did reduce the expression of some TJ proteins in the MUC13-ΔCT cells, but these changes were not significant between three experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). This might suggest that deletion of the MUC13 tail only can enhance PKC activity to stabilize TJ proteins. A role for PKCδ in the regulation of TJs is in line with previously reported results linking PKCδ to upregulation of claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels in different epithelial cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). In future studies, we intend to address the link between MUC13 and PKCδ during TJ regulation in more detail. Based on our current data, we propose a model in which MUC13 negatively impacts claudin build up at the membrane by regulating the levels and/or activity of PKCδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Confirmation of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail deletion cell lines with MUC13-targeted antibodies indicated that both MUC13-ΔCT cell lines lacked the cytoplasmic tail. The MUC13 extracellular domain was detectable in the MUC13-ΔCT 1 cell line but expression in the MUC13-ΔCT 2 cell line was very limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). The reduced percentage of MUC13-ΔCT cells expressing MUC13 on the surface compared to WT cells might indicate reduced stability of the MUC13 protein lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Despite the possible differences in MUC13 stability or antibody binding, the phenotypic characterization of both MUC13-ΔCT cells was very similar and neither cell line phenocopied the effect of the full MUC13 knockout on TEER and TJ. Therefore, we are confident that the targeted removal of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail was successful, and the results obtained with these cell lines are reliable. Removal of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail led to a partial phenotype, where ZO-1 and claudins-1, -2, -3, and -4 were upregulated in the membrane, although to a lower extent compared to the full knockout. This was accompanied by a slight increase in TEER and reduced paracellular permeability to Lucifer Yellow substrate compared to WT cells. Also in the PKC experiments, the MUC13-ΔCT cells showed a partial phenotype but did demonstrate a dependency on PKC activity for elevated expression of TJ proteins. Together, these results point to a pivotal role for both the MUC13 extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail in TJ buildup and underline the challenge of studying the functions of different TM mucin domains.</p><p id="P28">In healthy conditions, the transmembrane mucin MUC13 is involved in important biological processes, including cell growth and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), protection of cells from toxin-induced damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), and formation of a physical barrier to reduce bacterial contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that MUC13 is a negative regulator of PKC-mediated TJ protein assembly at the membrane. Overexpression of MUC13, as observed in IBD, may lead to a reduction in TJ proteins, such as occludin, claudins, and ZOs, and increased paracellular permeability to water, ions, and organic solutes. Opening of TJ complexes is essential to allow sampling of luminal bacteria by immune cells but decreased barrier function can also contribute to the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. It is interesting to speculate that MUC13 with its complex extracellular domain, could play a role in sensing the inflammatory state of the intestine and can respond by regulating TJs through its cytoplasmic tail. Our study brings to light that the transmembrane mucin MUC13 plays a unique role in the intestinal epithelium and emphasizes the need for further studies into the functions of specific mucins.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Cell lines, bacteria, and culture conditions</title><p id="P29">The human intestinal epithelial cell lines HRT18 (ATCC-CCL-244), Caco-2 (ATCC-HTB-37), and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout derivative cell lines used in this study, as well as HEK293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC) were routinely grown in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) + glutamax (Life technologies, 31966047) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma, F7524) at 37°C in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

For the MUC13 overexpression experiments, HRT18-WT Ctr, HRT18-WT+pMUC13, HRT18-ΔMUC13 Ctr, and HRT18-ΔMUC13+pMUC13 cells were seeded in 24 Transwell plates with 6.5 mm inserts and 0.4 mM membrane pore size (Costar, 3470) at 30% (WT) and 60% (ΔMUC13) confluency. TEER was measured every 2-3 days for 2 weeks. At day 14, doxycycline was added to the top compartment at a concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. To study the effect of MLCK, ROCK, and PKC on TEER build up over time, ML-7 (50 mM), Y-27632 (50 mM), or GF-109203X (20 mM) inhibitors were added to the upper compartment, respectively, at days 3, 6, and 9. TEER measurements were taken every 1-2 days for 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Epithelial permeability assays with Lucifer Yellow, FITC-Dextran and LPS</title><p id="P37">Epithelial paracellular permeability for particles was assessed by measuring the flux of 0.5 kDa Lucifer Yellow CH dipotassium salt and 4 and 70 kDa FITC-Dextran particles across confluent monolayers. Cells were grown for 2 weeks in 12-well Transwell plates with 12 mm inserts and 0.4 mM membrane pore size (Costar, 3401). To minimize interference from the media when measuring FITC, media from the bottom wells was changed to DMEM without red phenol + 10% FCS. Subsequently, 500 mL of 4 or 70 kDa FITC-Dextran dissolved to 1 mg/mL in DMEM without red phenol or 500 mL of 400 mg/mL LY was added to the top compartments. After 2 h incubation with LY or 6 h with FITC-Dextran particles, 100 mL aliquots were taken from the bottom wells and the fluorescent intensity was measured with a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 492 nm and 520 nm for FITC-Dextran, and 428 and 540 nm for LY. The percentage of permeability was calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensity to that of membrane-only wells.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>LPS translocation assays</title><p id="P38">Cells were grown for 2 weeks in 12-well Transwell plates with 12 mm inserts and 0.4 mM membrane pore size (Costar, 3401).

To determine the maximum amount of LPS that could be translocated, 5 mg of LPS was added to wells without cells (membrane only). The next day, the bottom compartments were frozen at -20°C until further use. For quantitative detection of LPS, HEK-Blue™ hTLR4 were used with HEK-Blue™ Null cells as negative control. 2.5×10<sup>4</sup> HEK-Blue™ Null cells and 3.5×10<sup>4</sup> HEK-Blue™ hTLR4 cells (due to slightly slower growth of the Null cells) were seeded in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, cells were stimulated with 100 mL of media from the Transwell bottom of the LPS translocation experiment. For quantification of the LPS concentration, 10-fold dilutions of LPS from 100 ng/mL to 0.1 ng/mL in 100 mL were used. HEK-Blue™ hTLR4 and HEK-Blue™ Null cells were stimulated with the LPS-containing fractions for 24 h at 37°C. Relative NF-κB activity as a result of TLR4 stimulation was determined by quantifying the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity. Twenty mL of HEK-Blue™ supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate containing 180 mL pre-warmed (37°C) QUANTI-Blue™ (the substrate for SEAP, InvivoGen, rep-qbs). Reactions were developed at 37°C for 50-90 min and measured at 630 nm using FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Lactech). Three wells with DMEM only were used as blanks and subtracted from the other measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Epithelial barrier experiments with <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic></title><p id="P39">Cells were grown for 2 weeks in 12-well Transwell plates with 12 mm inserts and 0.4 mM membrane pore size (Costar, 3401).

Media in the basolateral compartment was replaced with fresh DMEM without FCS. TEER was measured at multiple time points until 42 h. All measurements were performed on three individual wells and in three independent biological replicates. TEER W/cm<sup>2</sup> values were calculated by subtracting the average negative control value from the measurement and multiplying it by the well surface (1.12 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Subcellular fractionation</title><p id="P40">For subcellular fractionation of epithelial monolayers, a protocol from Abcam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.abcam.com/protocols/subcellular-fractionation-protocol">https://www.abcam.com/protocols/subcellular-fractionation-protocol</ext-link>) was used with some modifications. Cells were grown in 10 cm<sup>2</sup> culture dishes for 2 weeks, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scrapped with a cell scraper in 500 mL fractionation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Cell suspensions were passed 10 times through a 26G needle and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. The supernatant containing cytoplasm, membranes and mitochondria was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and kept on ice. To maximize cell membrane rupture, these steps were repeated: resuspension of the pellet in buffer, lysis by a needle, and centrifugation. The recovered supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min to separate the mitochondria (pellet) from the cytoplasm and membranes (supernatant). Supernatants were transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatants containing the cytosolic fraction were transferred to a Spin-X UF 10 kDa Centrifugal Concentrator (Corning) and concentrated by centrifugation to a final volume of 100 mL. The pellet of the ultracentrifugation step containing the membrane fraction was taken up in 500 mL of fractionation buffer and re-centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C for increased purity. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mL TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS). Protein concentrations in all fractions were determined with Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit (ThermoFisher, 23225) and equal amounts were loaded into SDS-PAGE gels to confirm the efficiency of the protocol. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase protein was chosen as a control for the membrane fraction, b-actin for the cytosolic fraction, and acetyl-Histone H3K9 to exclude nuclear contamination.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p id="P41">Cell pellets were taken up in 1% SDS in PBS and lysed by mechanical lysis through a 26G needle.

For immunoblotting of MUC13, protein lysates were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Biorad) for 10 min at 2.5 amperes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS-Tween for 1 h at RT. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with MUC13 antibody directed against CT domain (Abcam) at 1:250 dilution in PBS-Tween containing 5% skimmed milk powder o/n at 4°C. The next day, the membranes were washed 4 times with PBS-Tween (10 minutes each) and incubated with secondary antibody diluted 1:5,000 in PBS-Tween containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h at RT. For immunoblotting of other proteins, protein lysates were loaded onto 8-12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Blocking was done o/n at 4°C in 5% BSA-TSMT (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> adjusted to pH 7 with HCl and 0.1% Tween 20). Antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA-TSMT and incubated for 1 h at RT. Antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution, except for claudin antibodies which were used at 1:500 dilution and b-actin antibody at 1:2,000.

Free biotin was washed away twice with cold sulfo-NHS SS-biotin blocking solution (50 mM NH4Cl in PBS, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2). Five hunderd mL Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche, dissolved in PBS) was added and cells were harvested from the Transwell membrane using a disposable cell scrapper and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Samples were lysed for 45 min at RT by mechanical lysis. These samples were labeled as Day 0 (maximum amount of labeled proteins). Fresh DMEM + 10% FCS + Pen/Strep was added to the other wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 day or 3 days, after which cells were harvested and lysed as described above. After incubation with Lysis Buffer, lysates were cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min. A small fraction of all cleared lysates was saved in another tube for the total protein sample. Per sample, 60 mL of Pierce Streptavidin Agarose Beads (ThermoScientific) were washed with 1 mL Lysis Buffer in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 2 min at 4,500 x g. After a second wash, beads were resuspended in Lysis Buffer equivalent to 60 mL/sample.

Cell junction complexes that contain claudins, occludin, ZOs, and E-cadherin, are assembled along the lateral membrane. Under normal conditions, there is some paracellular passage of ions and small solutes, a process that is controlled by the TJ proteins claudins and occludin. MUC13 cytoplasmic tail has a putative PKC binding motif, which may play are role in recruiting PKC and controlling its activity and/or stability. Cell junction proteins such as claudins, occludin, and ZO-1 also can be targeted by PKCs. (<bold>B</bold>) In the absence of the complete MUC13 protein, TJ proteins (occludin, claudins, and ZO-1) are accumulating at the membrane over time, causing increased transepithelial resistance (TEER) and lower paracellular passage of small solutes. The TEER buildup in ΔMUC13 cells is dependent on MLCK, ROCK and PKC kinases. The accumulation of claudins at the membrane in ΔMUC13 cells is PKC-dependent and is not caused by slower degradation rates of TJ proteins through recycling endosomes. (<bold>C</bold>) Removal of the MUC13 cytoplasmic tail leads to an intermediate phenotype with some accumulation of claudin-1, -3, -4, and ZO-1 at the membrane, but to a lower extent compared to the full knockout. The role of PKC in this cell line remains to be determined. MUC13-ΔCT cells are less permeable to small solutes but do not show a significant increase in TEER when compared to WT cells. The degradation rate of TJ proteins in MUC13-ΔCT cells is comparable to WT and ΔMUC13.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156321-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
