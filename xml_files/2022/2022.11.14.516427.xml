However, whether and how lysosomes mediate the mitochondrial stress response (MSR) remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that lysosomal acidification via the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (v-ATPase) is essential for the transcriptional activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>). Mitochondrial stress stimulates v-ATPase-mediated lysosomal activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which then directly phosphorylates the MSR transcription factor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Disruption of mTORC1-dependent ATF4 phosphorylation blocks the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, but not other similar stress responses, such as the UPR<sup>ER</sup>. Finally, ATF4 phosphorylation downstream of the v-ATPase/mTORC1 signaling is indispensable for sustaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis and protecting cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated cell death upon mitochondrial stress. Thus, v-ATPase/mTORC1-mediated ATF4 phosphorylation via lysosomes links mitochondrial stress to UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation and mitochondrial function resilience.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Long known as the degradative end points for intra- and extra-cellular cargos, lysosomes have emerged as signaling centers that play important roles in nutrient sensing, cell growth, energy metabolism, immune response and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Accordingly, dysfunction of lysosomes has been associated with a variety of diseases including lysosomal storage disorders, cancer, diseases of the immune system and neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To maintain energy homeostasis and protein quality control, lysosomes also constantly communicate with other cellular organelles, such as the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For example, severe mitochondrial dysfunction triggers mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, which results in the degradation of impaired mitochondria by the lysosomes; whereas changes in lysosomal pH or signaling may in turn modulate mitochondrial function and regulate longevity in different organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, whether and how the lysosomes mediate the communication from stressed mitochondria to the nucleus are still poorly understood.</p><p id="P4">The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>), a branch of the mitochondrial stress response (MSR), is an adaptive transcriptional response that helps to resolve proteostatic toxicity triggered by diverse mitochondrial stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Although first discovered in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the regulatory mechanisms of UPR<sup>mt</sup> have been particularly well-studied in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> a panel of transcription factors/co-factors, histone methyltransferases, demethylases, acetyltransferases and deacetylase cooperate with the master UPR<sup>mt</sup> transcription factor, activated transcription factor-1 (ATFS-1), to mediate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> upon mitochondrial perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, how the mitochondrial stress signal is relayed through the cytosol and sensed by these UPR<sup>mt</sup> regulators is largely unclear. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial stress triggers the integrated stress response (ISR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, in which phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (EIF2α) results in the translation of several transcription factors including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) to coordinate a gene expression program considered as the functional equivalent of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In a parallel study conducted in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we revealed that increased ATFS-1 translation, mediated by the v-ATPase/TORC1 and lysosomes, contributes to the cytosolic relay of mitochondrial stress to direct UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation through an EIF-2α phosphorylation-independent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, whether the roles of lysosomes and v-ATPase/TORC1 in UPR<sup>mt</sup> regulation are evolutionally conserved remains elusive. Furthermore, how mammalian cells distinguish stress signals from different origins, such as the mitochondrion and ER, to concordantly activate the ATF4-mediated “integrated stress response” is still unknown.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Suppression of lysosomal acidification inhibits UPR<sup>mt</sup> in mammalian cells</title><p id="P5">The vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (v-ATPase) is a highly conserved large complex proton pump which locates at the lysosomal surface and is essential for the acidification of lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In addition to its role as a proton pump, v-ATPase has also been shown to be crucial for the integration of multiple signaling pathways, including mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, as well as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We first questioned if the role of v-ATPase in UPR<sup>mt</sup> is functionally conserved in mammalian cells. Doxycycline (Dox)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, an antibiotic that inhibits mitochondrial ribosome translation, activated the MSR and increased the expression of many UPR<sup>mt</sup> transcripts (e.g., <italic>HSPA9</italic>, <italic>HSPD1</italic> and <italic>ASNS</italic>) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Similarly, inhibition of v-ATPase activity by two small-molecule inhibitors, Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) and Concanamycin A (ConA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, strongly attenuated Dox-induced expression of typical UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Among these approaches to suppress UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation, ConA treatment in MEFs was most efficacious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Strikingly, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of ConA on inhibiting Dox-induced UPR<sup>mt</sup> is below 1.5 nM in MEFs, while that of BafA1 is around 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), in line with a more prominent effect of ConA in suppressing v-ATPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To systematically evaluate the impact of v-ATPase inhibition on the transcriptional activation of the MSR, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on total RNA isolated from MEFs treated with DMSO control or ConA for 24 h, in the absence or presence of three mechanistically different mitochondrial stressors: a mitochondrial translation inhibitor, Dox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>; a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, Antimycin A (AntiA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>; and a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide <italic>p</italic>-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Dox up-regulated 797 transcripts (adjusted <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05), and 736 (92.3%) of them were also induced by AntiA or FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In contrast, FCCP led to the up-regulation of 4,182 transcripts, and only 1,364 (32.6%) of them were commonly shared with those induced by either Dox or AntiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). As expected, the 443 genes up-regulated in response to all the three mitochondrial stress inducers were enriched for mitochondrial surveillance pathways such as “Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase”, “Amino-acid biosynthesis” and “Mitochondrion” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), in line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

Importantly, among the 797 Dox-induced transcripts, a majority (58.6%, 467 transcripts) of them was abrogated by ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These 467 genes, hereby defined as the “v-ATPase activity-dependent Dox-induced genes”, were enriched for MSR-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), and include UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes such as <italic>Asns</italic>, <italic>Phgdh</italic>, <italic>Psat1</italic>, <italic>Psph</italic>, <italic>Shmt2</italic> and <italic>Mthfd2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Likewise, around half (47.8%) of the AntiA-induced transcripts relied on v-ATPase activity for induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Despite that only 30.4% of the FCCP-induced transcripts were abrogated by ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>), the 832 AntiA-induced and 1,271 FCCP-induced transcripts that were dependent on v-ATPase activity were both enriched for mitochondrion-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>). In contrast, the other 2,911 FCCP-induced transcripts independent on v-ATPase activity were highly enriched for other cellular organelles such as “Endoplasmic reticulum”, “Golgi apparatus”, “Lysosome” and “Endosome” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>), suggesting that the v-ATPase inhibitor ConA probably attenuated the adaptive response specifically related to mitochondria, but not other cellular organelles such as the ER.</p><p id="P8">Consistently, ConA inhibited the induction of UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes, including <italic>Hspa9</italic>, <italic>Asns</italic>, <italic>Psph</italic> and <italic>Mthfd2</italic>, upon exposure to mitochondrial stress inducers, AntiA and Oligomycin (Olig) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1k</xref>). Despite that the ER UPR (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) inducer Tunicamycin (TM) also up-regulated these MSR transcripts, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, their induction upon TM treatment was surprisingly not affected by ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1k</xref>). Moreover, the TM-induced dramatic up-regulation of ER chaperone <italic>Grp78/Bip</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, a key event of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, was also not affected by ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1k</xref>). As an alternative approach to inhibit lysosome acidification and mimic v-ATPase loss-of-function, disruption of lysosomal pH gradient by chloroquine (CQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, also abrogated Dox-induced UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation, but not TM-induced stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 1j</xref>). Interestingly, different from the effect of ConA and CQ, the mTOR inhibitors Rapamycin and Torin1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, robustly attenuated the induction of typical UPR<sup>mt</sup> and UPR<sup>ER</sup> genes in response to Dox or TM treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and inhibited the expression of key transcription factors <italic>Atf4</italic>, <italic>Atf5</italic> and <italic>Chop</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1l</xref>). Together, these results suggest that disruption of lysosomal acidification by inhibiting v-ATPase activity or CQ suppresses the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, but not other similar stress responses such as the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, while direct mTORC1 inhibition abrogates the transcriptional responses induced by both mitochondrial and ER stress inducers.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Lysosomal inhibition increases ATF4 accumulation but also limits ATF4 binding to the promoters of UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes</title><p id="P9">To investigate the mechanism on how lysosomes and v-ATPase regulate the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, we first checked the expression levels of the putative UPR<sup>mt</sup> transcription factors (i.e., ATF4, ATF5 and CHOP) upon ConA treatment, with or without mitochondrial stress. Surprisingly, their mRNA levels were up-regulated even in cells with only ConA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>); the expression of multiple classical ATF4 targets, including <italic>Chac1</italic>, <italic>Herpud1</italic>, <italic>Trib3</italic> and <italic>Slc7a11</italic>, that are induced in response to ER stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, were increased as well under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Similar patterns were also found for the mitophagy/autophagy transcripts (e.g., <italic>Sqstm1</italic>, <italic>Binp3l</italic>, <italic>Pink1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). At protein level, Dox mildly increased EIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Interestingly, more ATF4 protein was detected in ConA/Dox co-treated MEFs at all time points, as compared to Dox-only conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of ATF5 and CHOP was either not affected or only slightly induced by Dox or ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, ConA alone increased ATF4 protein expression in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, complete inhibition of mTORC1 activity by Torin1 led to depletion of ATF4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), in line with its mRNA changes and previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1l</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To understand how ConA leads to ATF4 protein accumulation, we then measured the protein stability of ATF4 when protein synthesis was blocked by a translation inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). The half-life of ATF4 is very short at basal state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, and was almost doubled (from 30 to 60 min) in the presence of ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Next, by using a ATF4 translation reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, which expresses a HA-tagged reporter protein under the strict control of ATF4 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), we found that ConA in general did not affect the translation activity of ATF4 (as determined by comparing the expression of the ATF4 5’UTR-driven HA-tagged reporter protein and the normal CMV5 promoter-driven GFP protein), in response to either Dox or TM treatment for 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Meanwhile, the endogenous expression of ATF4 protein increased by 60% upon only ConA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These results suggest that a basal mTORC1 activity still retains for normal ATF4 translation even with v-ATPase inhibition, and ConA increases ATF4 accumulation through a translation-independent mechanism.</p><p id="P11">Increased expression of ATF4 was also found in cells with <italic>ATP6V0C</italic> or <italic>ATP6V0D1</italic> knockdown, or CQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). To elucidate how the accumulated ATF4 protein in ConA-treated MEFs failed to activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes upon mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we pulled-down the endogenous ATF4 in MEFs with or without ConA and/or Dox treatment, and performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). Dox strongly promoted the enrichment of ATF4 at the loci of multiple UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes (e.g., <italic>Hspa9</italic>, <italic>Hspe1</italic>, <italic>Asns</italic>, <italic>Mthfd2</italic>), which was almost completely blocked by ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). In contrast, enrichment of ATF4 at the loci of UPR<sup>ER</sup>-related genes was either unchanged (e.g., <italic>Grp78/Bip</italic>) or even increased (e.g., <italic>Trib3</italic>) upon ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>), in line with their changes at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, inhibition of lysosomal acidification increases ATF4 accumulation but also limits ATF4 binding to the promoters of UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes during mitochondrial stress.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Mitochondrial stress induces a lysosomal activity-dependent mTORC1 activation at the lysosomal surface</title><p id="P12">Next, we checked whether mTORC1 signaling is activated upon mitochondrial stress, as revealed in our recent studies in human thyroid cancer cells and in <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. mTORC1 activity (as reflected by the phosphorylation of S6K, S6 and 4E-BP1) increased and peaked at 2-4 h of Dox treatment in MEFs, which was attenuated by the v-ATPase inhibitor ConA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). A similar time-dependent activation pattern of mTORC1 was also observed in MEFs treated with AntiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), or with Olig treatment as reported eleswhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, the ER stress inducer TM gradually decreases S6K phosphorylation in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

This phenomenon is likely caused by the breakdown of mitochondria in the more acidic late endosomes or lysosomes, which in turn resulted in the loss of the mitochondrial signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. mTORC1 activation requires its dynamic recruitment to the lysosomal surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

In light of the kinase nature of mTOR, we questioned whether ATF4 is a direct phosphorylation target of mTORC1. Co-expression of ATF4 with the mTORC1 upstream activator Rheb increased the phosphorylation signal that was detected by a context-dependent (S*P) phosphorylation-specific antibody, which was inhibited by Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

These sites are in general well-conserved across vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). It has been reported that mTORC1 substrates including S6K and 4E-BP1 harbor a canonical five amino acid TOR signaling (TOS) motif that is crucial for their regulation by mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

Separated or combined mutation of the 5 phosphorylation candidate sites to alanine revealed that ATF4 phosphorylation at Ser<sup>166</sup> was specifically recognized by the context-dependent (S*P) phosphorylation antibody (referred hereafter as P-S166-ATF4 antibody), while P-T173-ATF4 was revealed by another context-dependent (ST*P) antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Moreover, Dox increased the endogenous P-S166-ATF4 and P-T173-ATF4 levels, which were furthermore abrogated by both ConA and Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Finally, increased phosphorylation of ATF4 at S166 and T173 was also detected upon exposure to the mitochondrial stress inducers such as AntiA and Olig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), while ER stress inducer TM suppressed ATF4 phosphorylation, consistent with the changes of S6K phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that while disruption of mTORC1-mediated ATF4 phosphorylation does not affect the basal function of ATF4 in maintaining cell growth, ATF4 phosphorylation downstream of v-ATPase/mTORC1 signaling plays a determining role in sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis and promoting survival from ROS-associated cell death in response to mitochondrial stress.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">The activity of mTORC1 has been shown to be required for increased ATF4 expression downstream of growth signals and during mitochondrial myopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.

Thus, the mechanism on how mTORC1 regulates ATF4 function, especially during mitochondrial stress, is still not fully understood.

We found that in response to mitochondrial stress, mTORC1 is activated at the lysosomal surface via the v-ATPase, whereas EIF2α phosphorylation is only mildly increased, leading to a moderate increase in ATF4 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Meanwhile, activated mTORC1 directly phosphorylates ATF4, leading to increased ATF4 binding to the promoters of UPR<sup>mt</sup> genes and the activation of UPR<sup>mt</sup>. In contrast, upon ER stress, mTORC1 activity is gradually suppressed but EIF2α phosphorylation is robustly increased, leading to a robust increase in ATF4 translation, and the subsequent activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>. Disruption of lysosomal acidification by CQ or the v-ATPase inhibitor ConA hence specifically suppressed the activation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> but not of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>.

LC6060, Invitrogen) staining, the bands corresponding to His-ATF4 were sliced, digested with either trypsin or GluC, and then analyzed by Liquid Chromatograph Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) for phosphorylated peptides.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P32">All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 8 software. Differences between two groups were assessed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc test (one-way ANOVA for comparisons between groups, and two-way ANOVA for comparisons of magnitude of changes between different groups from different treatments or cell lines) was used when comparing more than two groups.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="P33">Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="extended-data"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Fig. 1</label><caption><title>An essential role of v-ATPase and mTORC1 activity in UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation.</title><p id="P34"><bold>a</bold>, qRT-PCR results (<italic>n</italic> = 4 biologically independent samples) of HEK293T cells expressing control (ctrl) or <italic>ATP6V0D1</italic> sgRNA, and treated with or without Doxycycline (Dox) (30 μg/ml) for 24 h. <bold>b</bold>, qRT-PCR results (<italic>n</italic> = 4 biologically independent samples) of MEFs pretreated with DMSO control or Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (1 μM) for 1 h, and then co-treated with or without Dox (30 μg/ml) for 24 h. <bold>c</bold>, The up-regulated transcripts in response to Dox, Antimycin A (AntiA) or FCCP treatment based on the RNA-seq dataset. <bold>d</bold>,<bold>e</bold>, Functional clustering of the 443 (<bold>d</bold>) and 2,818 (<bold>e</bold>) genes as indicated in (<bold>c</bold>). <bold>f</bold>,<bold>g</bold>, Volcano plots showing the effect of Dox in control (DMSO-treated) MEFs (<bold>f</bold>), or in ConA-treated MEFs (<bold>g</bold>) (numbers in bold are the common genes within the 797 genes as indicated in (<bold>f</bold>)).
