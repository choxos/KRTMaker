length to likelihood of endometriosis and ovarian cancer and can thus serve as a paradigm for a highly pleiotropic genetic variant. Pleiotropy makes it challenging to assign specific causal roles to particular genetic variants. Deleterious mutations in multifunctional genes may cause either the co-occurrence of multiple disorders in the same individuals (i.e., syndromes), or be repeatedly associated with a variety of disorders in a population. Moreover, the adverse effects can occur in combination with advantages in other traits, maintaining high frequencies of deleterious alleles in the population. To reveal the causal role of this specific SNP, we investigated the molecular mechanisms affected by rs3820282 in mice. We have shown previously that rs3820282 introduces a high affinity estrogen receptor 1 binding site at the <italic>Wnt4</italic> locus. Having introduced this nucleotide substitution into the homologous site of the mouse genome by CRISPR/Cas 9 we show that this change causes a specific upregulation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> transcription in the endometrial stromal cells during the preovulatory estrogen peak in late proestrus. Transcriptomic analysis of the whole uterus reveals broad systemic effects on uterine gene expression, including downregulation of proliferation and induction of many progesterone-regulated pro-implantation genes. The effect on proliferation is limited to the luminal epithelium, whereas other effects involve the uterine stromal compartment. We suggest that in the uterus, these changes could contribute to increased permissiveness to embryo invasion. Yet in other estrogen-responsive tissues, the same changes potentially lead to decreased resistance to invasion by cancer cells and endometriotic foci. A single molecular effect of rs3820282 on <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression may thus underlie the various associated phenotypic effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antagonistic pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>rs3820282</kwd><kwd>invasibility</kwd><kwd>implantation</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor alpha</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) frequently reveal associations between multiple diseases and a polymorphism at the single genomic locus, suggesting pleiotropy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Disease pleiotropy may originate from either the same molecular mechanism involved in different disease processes or through broader systemic effects of the mutation - such as immune or metabolic disorders - affecting different disease phenotypes. Alternatively, different genetic variants involved in etiologically unconnected diseases could be co-inherited due to genetic linkage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Beyond the mere presence of genetic correlation, recent studies have also addressed the <italic>direction</italic> of the effects of specific variants on single traits (diseases), i.e., whether they are deleterious or beneficial with respect to different phenotypes. While many pleiotropic variants have congruent fitness effects in all diseases (i.e., the same allele is deleterious in all), studies also commonly find cases of antagonistic pleiotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, where a variant augments the likelihood of one disorder, while protecting the carrier from another <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Antagonism in pleiotropy is particularly interesting as it may explain the high frequency of some of the apparently deleterious alleles in a population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, reflect a biological trade-off that can inform the disease mechanisms, and provide guidance in search of treatment strategies that should be preferred or avoided due to the associated side effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Deciphering the molecular basis of statistical associations requires determining the exact genomic location of the causal polymorphism, the target gene (most variants are in the regulatory genome), the spatial and temporal context of the mutational effect (i.e., tissue or cell type, stage of development or physiology), the molecular pathway mediating the effect, and the organismal processes mapping the genetic change onto the final phenotype. Information from multiple diseases can facilitate the analysis of the mechanistic basis of mutation effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In this paper, we present the results of a functional genetic study of one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of <italic>Wnt4</italic> (rs3820282) on human chromosome 1 (1p 36.12). The frequency of the alternate allele at rs3820282 (T, with reference allele being C) varies strongly across human populations, ranging from less than 1% in Africa to over 50% in SE Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This SNP has been associated with variation in multiple human female reproductive traits. Thereby, the same allele is associated with deleterious as well as protective effects on diseases such as endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, ovarian epithelial cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, length of gestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and leiomyoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Specifically, the alternate allele has been associated with higher likelihood of endometriosis, fibroids (leiomyoma), and ovarian epithelial cancer, yet it is also associated with longer gestation and is potentially protective against preterm birth. Rather than focusing on the etiology of any one disease, we focus here on the immediate molecular and cellular mechanisms through which the locus exerts its function, likely mediating different disease contexts.</p><p id="P4">The disease associations of this SNP are consistently related to female reproductive biology, a context in which regulation by estrogen is central. An exceptionally well powered GWAS, in an attempt to understand the genetic basis of preterm birth, found that the alternate allele introduces a potent binding site for estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, this binding site overlaps with open chromatin in immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line, HESC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The information on downstream consequences of mutation is less robust, although this question has been experimentally addressed previously (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Estrogen responsiveness has been directly implicated in most diseases associated with the genomic region of the rs3820282 allele. Endometriosis has been associated with the incomplete transition of the endometrium from the estrogen-dominated proliferative phase to the progesterone-dominated secretory phase of the estrous cycle, also referred to as progesterone resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, due to dysregulation in the early secretory phase of many genes mediating progesterone effects. Fine-mapping studies of the region to identify the causal SNP in the context of endometriosis have confirmed rs3820282 as a prioritized candidate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Estrogen also enhances the growth of uterine leiomyoma (fibroids), a common benign tumor of the myometrial smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. A recent GWAS in a large Icelandic cohort found associations of uterine fibroids with alleles at two sets of loci: loci shared with a wide range of cancers, and loci shared with various reproductive abnormalities, specifically implicating involvement of estrogen signaling, among them rs3820282<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Increased estrogen and androgen, as well as hyperactivity of stroma have further been proposed to contribute to the pathogenicity of ovarian cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and recent association studies linked both ovarian as well as breast cancers to the region of the focal locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup><sub>.</sub></p><p id="P6">This genomic region of interest is conserved across placental mammals (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), likely due to the key roles of Wnt in vertebrate development and physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The mammalian reference genomes (including C57B/6J mouse line, used in this study as wild type, WT) carry what in the human population is the major allele. Many aspects of female reproductive biology are also conserved between mice and humans. Therefore, we expect that the molecular effect of this mutation in mice will be informative for studying its effect in humans.</p><p id="P7">To determine the molecular mechanisms affected by the SNP rs3820282, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-modified transgenic (TG) mouse line, homozygous for what is the human alternate allele, and compared it to the homozygous WT mouse line of the same background. Genome-editing circumvents the effect of linkage between the neighboring SNPs, due to which causal mutations are hard to distinguish from the linked ones in the human population. This method aids in the feasibility of experimentation and allows us to avoid the heterogeneity of the genetic background between individuals, which can hinder the attribution of effects to any one polymorphism. The context-dependent effects of a polymorphism is a relevant aspect that must be addressed separately. Using this transgenic mouse line we reveal that the mutation enhances the periodic estrogen-induced uterine preparation for implantation. We propose that this effect, when appearing in other estrogen-responsive tissues, may similarly enhance the permissibility of tissues to endometriosis and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">We used gene editing to replace the single nucleotide mouse wild type allele with the human alternate allele at the location in the mouse genome corresponding to rs3820282 in humans, using CRISPR/Cas9 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for detail). The position rs3820282 and its flanking sequences are 98% conserved between the human and mouse reference genomes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Live born pups were genotyped by PCR and then further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two out of three lines in which the overall region had been modified, had the specific one-nucleotide substitution we aimed for.

We focused on the uterine tissue, as previously reported associated reproductive phenotypes involved the uterus. We first investigated the expression of two genes adjacent to the SNP, <italic>Cdc42</italic> and <italic>Wnt4</italic>. We analyzed how the SNP affected the uterus across multiple stages of the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, specifically proestrus, estrus, and early pregnancy (7.5 days post conception, dpc). The mouse uterus undergoes important changes in preparation for implantation even prior to mating, thus pregnancy success can be influenced both during the pregnancy, as well as pre-pregnancy, during the stages preceding fertilization and implantation. We found no effect on the <italic>Cdc42</italic> gene adjacent to the polymorphism (proestrus: N = (11 TG, 4 WT), P = 0.34; estrus: N = (6 TG, 2 WT); Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).On the other hand, the two genotypes differed only in the uterine expression of <italic>Wnt4</italic> during proestrus, with a 1.48 log2 fold increase in <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in the transgenic compared to the wild type (N = (14 TG, 8 WT), P = 0.002). No significant difference between the genotypes was observed in Wnt4 mRNA expression in either estrus (N = (6 TG, 5 WT), P = 0.08, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) or early pregnancy (7.5 dpc, N = (3 TG, 3 WT), P = 0.70, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>).

In contrast, in the transgenic line <italic>Wnt4</italic> is also strongly expressed in the stromal cells specifically underneath the luminal epithelium (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To further solidify this finding, we isolated primary endometrial stromal fibroblasts during late proestrus from transgenic and wild type mice and measured the respective expression levels of <italic>Wnt4</italic> by qPCR.

Specifically, hallmark gene set enrichment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> was found for processes involving the cell cycle including the G2/M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and genes associated with mitotic spindle assembly (adjusted p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).

Immunohistochemistry with anti-MKI67 (proliferation marker) antibody showed that the protein expression of MKI67 is limited to the luminal epithelium in both genotypes, and hence the downregulation of proliferation too must be limited to the epithelium (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Relevant to the disease phenotypes associated with the SNP, there is a significant downregulation of <italic>Spink12</italic>, the serine protease inhibitor, known to be expressed in various epithelia and regulated by differentiation signals.

In the following we briefly address the reported functions of the most upregulated genes.</p><p id="P15">We observe in the transgenic line the upregulation of many genes previously associated with progesterone increase, such as occurs in both mouse (early pregnancy) and human (early secretory phase), but without observing upregulation of progesterone receptor. In particular, we identify several genes related to modulation of uterine epithelial proliferation, a consequence of progesterone increase (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The most significantly upregulated factor involved is <italic>Errfi1</italic>, the Errb feedback inhibitor 1. Errfi1 has been shown to inhibit the action of epidermal growth factors. Accordingly, the ablation of <italic>Errfi1</italic> leads to uterine epithelial hyperplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In the uterus, <italic>Errfi1</italic> was shown to mediate progesterone activity by inhibiting the mitogenic action of Erbb2 (receptor tyrosine kinase) and opposing the estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation in the presence of progesterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Further upregulated genes, such as Kruppel-like factors <italic>Klf15</italic> and, to a lesser extent, <italic>Klf9</italic> mediate suppression of epithelial growth upon combined estrogen and progesterone treatment, enhancing the pro-implantation actions of progesterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Knockout of <italic>Klf9</italic> inhibits implantation, thus we reason that its upregulation may positively affect implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.

Fgfr2 is another upregulated negative regulator of epithelial proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The enhancement of multiple proliferation inhibitors is consistent with the downregulation of proliferation-enhancing genes and the decrease in proliferation marker <italic>Mki67</italic>, whose expression is limited to epithelium. Consistent with progesterone-response-like expression pattern is also the upregulation in transgenic animals of <italic>Cyp1b1</italic>, an enzyme metabolizing estrogen. This may contribute to the local metabolism of mitogenic estrogen mediating the antagonistic effects of progesterone and estrogen on proliferation.</p><p id="P16">Several upregulated genes are involved in decidualization, a uterine endometrial transformation that in mice does not normally precede fertilization (but does in humans).

Also upregulated are <italic>Tcf23</italic>, a decidualization-associated transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and <italic>Crebrf</italic>, a factor involved in regulation of stress response, whose expression is known to increase at implantation site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Among the significantly upregulated genes known for their roles in modulating receptivity and invasibility is Folistatin (<italic>Fst</italic>), whose uterine-specific knockout in mouse reduces the responsiveness of the luminal epithelium to estrogen and progesterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Similarly, integrins (<italic>Itgb3, Itga8,</italic> and associated <italic>Lim2</italic>) have been repeatedly implicated in embryo attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, and are also associated with wound healing and vascularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stromal invasibility in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

The most prominent Wnt signaling pathway is the canonical pathway involving inhibition of ß-catenin degradation and promoting its translocation into the nucleus, where it acts as transcription factor of several Wnt target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Wnt4 is known to signal via canonical as well as several non-canonical pathways in different contexts.

The present study aimed to uncover the immediate consequences of this allele substitution. Having created a transgenic mouse line with the human alternate allele, we took advantage of the natural estrogen dynamics during the mouse ovarian cycle to unravel the spatio-temporal context of mutational effects, and their direct consequences on gene expression. We found that the mutation causes upregulation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> in endometrial stromal cells, coinciding with the late proestrus estrogen peak. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the mutation activates uterine <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in response to estrogen, independently of the presence of conceptus. The numerous changes in the downstream uterine gene expression suggest effects on two general processes: the suppression of proliferation in epithelium, and the upregulation of pathways involved with embryo receptivity and the uterine susceptibility to invasion.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Transgenic gene expression changes and uterine biology</title><p id="P23">The mammalian uterus undergoes remarkable changes throughout the pregnant as well as nonpregnant cycle, mediated by the fluctuations in the ovarian steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone, and their respective receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. The transition from proestrus to estrus for example, is characterized by changes in transcription of a large number of genes, precipitating changes in morphology, tissue remodeling, adhesion and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

Wnt4 subsequently acts as a downstream effector of progesterone signaling and is thus responsible for some of the effects otherwise associated with progesterone upregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Specifically, Franco and coauthors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> showed that conditional ablation of Wnt4 increased apoptosis during stromal cell decidualization in mice and significantly reduced embryo implantation. Importantly, they found an effect of <italic>Wnt4</italic> upregulation on progesterone-regulated genes without upregulation of progesterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> receptor, suggesting that Wnt4 mediates the effect of progesterone, consistent with the present results, with the exception that here Wnt4 is regulated in response to estrogen.</p><p id="P25">Implantation is a critical event, hence in species with spontaneous ovarian cyclicity several recurring uterine changes have evolved in preparation for implantation. In most mammals, some uterine changes precede the presence of the conceptus and thus occur also in the nonpregnant cycle (e.g., edema), whereas others require copulation or the presence of conceptus. In humans, the preparatory changes are more extensive and include stromal decidualization, which in almost all non-primate mammals requires the presence of conceptus. Mammalian preimplantation uterine changes include actin cytoskeleton remodeling and reorganization of focal adhesions and junctional complexes in stromal cells, loss of epithelial polarity, changes in apical membrane and increase of glycogen production in luminal epithelium and stroma, as well as changes in vascular permeability and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. As several of these processes are mediated by progesterone, the observation of enhanced pro-implantation signature downstream of <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression is plausible. A surprising aspect is that these progesterone-induction-like changes precede the progesterone-dominated luteal phase. In mice, edema and angiogenesis increase during estrus (coinciding with increase in <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression), while further uterine remodeling occurs in days following copulation and fertilization, as a functional corpus luteum starts secreting progesterone. The upregulation pattern in a proestrus transgenic mouse therefore suggests an advanced induction of the preimplantation processes, which in absence of the conceptus, is broadly reminiscent of the human condition of spontaneous decidualization in humans. The early expression of <italic>Wnt4</italic> may enhance the receptivity by increasing the <italic>invasion susceptibility, i.e., invasibility</italic> of the uterus for implantation, thus explaining the positive effect of this mutation on human pregnancy outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Comparability to human</title><p id="P26">Predicting the comparability between model organisms and humans requires understanding of the shared, and accounting for the species-specific mechanisms. The mouse and human ovarian cycle and pregnancy have diverged during evolution. While we do not have a full mechanistic understanding of these differences, we know that many aspects of receptivity are conserved across mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. This is due to a shared evolutionary origin of invasive implantation in the stem lineage of placental mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, despite the likely independent origins of mechanisms controlling subsequent gestation length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.

Our results imply a two-pronged effect of the mutation: suppression of proliferation in the epithelium and enhancement of pro-implantation/invasion processes in the stroma. The association of the SNP with cancer and endometriosis may involve one or both of these. We suggest that the reported correlated associations of the mutation with reproductive cancers and endometriosis may be mediated through the second prong: the enhancement of pro-implantation processes, which make stroma more permissive to invasion by embryo but also by cancer and ectopic endometriotic tissue. This suggestion is inspired by the correlation across species between endometrial permissiveness to embryo implantation and vulnerability of peripheral stroma to cancer invasion, where species with more invasive placentation are more prone to invasion by metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Here we hypothesize that this relationship is not only a species-level phenomenon but applies within human populations; individuals with increased uterine embryo invasibility may be more prone to cancer metastasis and endometriosis.</p><p id="P28">Supporting the increased likelihood of cancer invasion in the transgenic line, is the set of the stromal dysregulated genes which match the expression pattern associated in the literature with stromal support of cancer invasion. The processes involved are matrix remodeling by proteases and cell-matrix adhesion (increased integrins and periostin), vaso-activation (increased <italic>Fst</italic>, <italic>Rgs</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, <italic>Serpine1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>), energy provisioning (increased <italic>Slc2a12</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>), and promotion of invasion (decreased <italic>Spink12</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>). Among the known pathways that influence tissue invasibility is also Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Thus, differences in tumor microenvironmental expression, not only in the cancer cells themselves, may explain the association with cancer invasion. Awareness of the importance for cancer invasion of supportive stromal microenvironment has increased in recent research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">While the dysregulation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> is temporally restricted by the estrogen peak, it is not necessarily spatially restricted to the uterus. It is plausible that the underlying processes are shared with other tissues expressing ESR1 receptors, even if the downstream effector genes may differ. The periodically elevated estrogen in the estrous cycle could thereby affect either the cancer cells themselves or the stroma exposed to and interacting with cancer cells. Such menstrual phase-dependent cancer invasibility has previously been suggested with respect to the propensity towards post-resection metastasis in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. These effects have been suggested to be due to cycle-phase-dependent fluctuation in angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF) and factors promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, downstream of estrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>.

Endometriosis has been associated with the failure of progesterone receptor to induce genes counteracting estrogen-driven cell proliferation in the secretory phase, i.e., the progesterone resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The strongest dysregulation of uterine gene expression in endometriosis was detected in the early secretory phase, whereby a significant <italic>Wnt4</italic> dysregulation is rarely reported (but see Liang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>, for <italic>Wnt4</italic> decrease). Interestingly, endometriosis-associated gene dysregulation in early secretory phase matches dysregulation in the transgenic mouse endometrium in the present study in terms of affected gene-set, above all the progesterone-regulated genes (e.g., <italic>Errfi1, Bcl6, Cited2, Irs2, Tgfb2, Gpx3, Tk1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></italic>).

Several factors could explain the mismatch between the effect in mouse proestrus, and its predicted effect on endometriosis: the species context (human vs. mouse), or the differing proportions of stromal and epithelial cells between mouse endometrium and endometriotic lesions. Alternatively, the associations with endometriosis and cancer may primarily stem from the effects of the SNP other than those on epithelial proliferation such as enhancement of pro-implantation/invasion- a hypothesis we propose.</p><p id="P32">Wnt4 has previously been proposed as the plausible causal candidate for endometriosis because of its genomic proximity to rs3820282 and its role in the development of the female genital tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>, which could precipitate a tendency towards reproductive defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. However, functional genetic follow-up on rs3820282 in the context of endometriosis did not confirm this effect. Luong and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and Powell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> tested the genes flanking rs3820282, and found that the alternate allele was associated with downregulation of LINC00339 (RNA gene absent from the mouse locus) in whole blood and endometrium, and upregulation of <italic>CDC42</italic> in whole blood.

There are several plausible sources for the discrepancy between these results and our current findings. First, while authors accounted for sample variation due to different stages of the menstrual cycle, only 16 of 132 samples were collected in the early secretory phase, somewhat close to the stage in which we show the effect. Second, 3C approach would not reveal the regulation of WNT4 as the SNP is in the <italic>WNT4</italic> intron itself. Finally, the Ishikawa cell line is derived from adenocarcinoma and thus has an uncertain cellular identity. These cells have been reported not to express <italic>WNT4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup> – rendering this line unsimilar to endometrial cells.

In the context of embryo implantation, the mutation enhances a normal process. In the context of reproductive cancers and endometriosis, it may not directly affect the origin or proliferation of cancer cells, but it does decrease the host tissue’s ability to resist the invasion, or even provide a supportive context. The idea of an evolutionary trade-off between the mammalian invasive implantation and the vulnerability to cancer metastasis is gaining support in recent research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. What may be common to both processes is the shared active role of the stromal microenvironment in regulation of invasion, either the embryo or cancer cells. The current study adds to the mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon by pointing out that such permissiveness to cancer may not be persistent but is limited to specific phases in the ovarian cycle, which modify not only the uterine, but potentially multiple estrogen responsive tissues. This differs from the idea of pre-metastatic niches in that the permissiveness of tissues to cancer invasion is not induced by the cancer cells themselves but is rather a side-effect of evolved uterine permissiveness and thus occurs, without consequences, also in the absence of cancer (or embryo). This enables a potentially different approach to restricting metastasis of estrogen-responsive cancers - by addressing its spatio-temporally local active support rather than modifying a ubiquitous growth process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p id="P34">Animals were kept under 12:12 light:dark cycle and bred within genotype in house.
