The neural behavior of glioblastoma, including the formation of synaptic circuitry and tumour microtubes, is increasingly understood to be pivotal for disease manifestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the few approved treatments for glioblastoma target its oncological nature, while its neural vulnerabilities remain incompletely mapped and clinically unexploited. Here, we systematically survey the neural molecular dependencies and cellular heterogeneity across glioblastoma patients and diverse model systems. In 27 surgical patient samples, we identify cancer cell morphologies indicative of poor prognosis, and discover repurposable neuroactive drugs with anti-glioblastoma efficacy by image-based drug screening. Glioblastoma cells exhibit functional dependencies on highly expressed neuroactive drug targets, while interpretable molecular machine learning (COSTAR) reveals their downstream convergence on AP-1-driven tumour suppression. This drug-target connectivity signature is confirmed by accurate <italic>in silico</italic> drug screening on &gt;1 million compounds, as well as by multi-omic profiling of glioblastoma drug responses. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven AP-1 pathway induction represents a tumour-intrinsic vulnerability at the intersection of oncogenesis and neural activity-dependent signaling. Opportunities for clinical translation of this neural vulnerability are epitomized by the antidepressant Vortioxetine synergizing with current standard of care treatments <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, the results presented here provide a mechanistic foundation and conceptual framework for the treatment of glioblastoma based on its neural origins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Glioblastoma is a deadly brain cancer with limited treatment options, shaped by heterogeneous developmental programs, genetic drivers, and tumour microenvironments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Despite an increasing understanding of this heterogeneity, the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ), which prolongs median survival from 12 to 15 months, remains the only first-line drug approved for glioblastoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Targeted therapies have been largely unsuccessful, in part due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limiting tumour accessibility, the presence of treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), and the lack of clinically predictive models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Systemically addressing these therapeutic roadblocks is an urgent clinical need.</p><p id="P5">An emerging paradigm is to consider glioblastoma in the context of the nervous system. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and lineage tracing studies of glioblastoma have identified stemness signatures resembling neural development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. At the brain-tumour interface, synaptic integration of cancer cells into neural circuits regulates tumour growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Within the tumour, the extension of microtubes akin to neuronal protrusions promotes the formation of treatment-resistant invasive networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, modulating specific neurotransmitter or other secretory pathways in the tumour microenvironment impairs glioblastoma metabolism and survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Such neural aspects of glioblastoma offer new clinically-targetable vulnerabilities that could be targeted by repurposing approved “neuroactive” drugs (NADs). Neuroactive drugs can cross the BBB and are routinely prescribed for indications such as psychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, as neuroactive drugs are originally developed to modulate the nervous system, their anti-cancer activity in glioblastoma patients is largely unknown.</p><p id="P6">Several key questions arise. First, how does neural intratumour heterogeneity across glioblastoma patients relate to disease course and response to therapy? Second, are there tumour-intrinsic neural vulnerabilities that are therapeutically targetable? Third, if so, which molecular dependencies and associated pathways are involved?</p><p id="P7">Here, we find morphological and neural stemness features across glioblastomas that relate to disease prognosis and drug response. Using pharmacoscopy (PCY), an <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging platform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> that captures patient and tumour complexity, we screen repurposable neuroactive drugs and identify a set with potent anti-glioblastoma activity. Top neuroactive drugs work consistently across patient samples and particularly target GSCs with neural morphologies associated with invasion and poor prognosis. These top drugs are validated across multiple glioblastoma model systems including patient-derived cultures and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Integration of anti-glioblastoma response with multiplexed RNA-Seq, reverse genetic screening, and machine learning of drug-target networks reveals convergence of neuroactive drugs with anti-glioblastoma activity on AP-1 and BTG gene families. In a neural context, AP-1 transcription factors, including JUN and FOS, are immediate early genes (IEGs) induced in response to neural activity or insult, while BTG1/2 are known tumour suppressors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Using this convergent AP-1/BTG connectivity signature, we predict and validate new candidate drugs across &gt;1 million compounds <italic>in silico</italic>. The antidepressant Vortioxetine is the top PCY-hit and inducer of the AP-1/BTG signature across diverse experimental model systems, synergizing with both first- and second-line glioblastoma therapies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study identifies clinically-actionable neuroactive drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma converging on a gene regulatory network involved in cell proliferation and neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Main</title><sec id="S3"><title>Capturing the phenotypic single-cell heterogeneity of glioblastoma</title><p id="P8">Glioblastoma cells adopt unique cellular morphologies and stemness properties to integrate and survive in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To comprehensively profile the morphological and molecular heterogeneity between and within glioblastoma patients, we investigated surgically-resected material from a clinically-annotated cohort of 27 glioblastoma patients (prospective cohort; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). We quantified cell type composition and morphology by high-content confocal imaging of freshly dissociated surgical samples cultured for two days <italic>ex vivo</italic> (n=27 patients), as well as in patient-matched tissue sections <italic>in situ</italic> (n=10 patients). In parallel, we measured somatic genetic alterations by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS; n=27 patients; Supplementary Table 2) and single-cell transcriptomes by scRNA-Seq (n=4 patients).</p><p id="P9">We mapped the single-cell landscape of glioblastoma patient samples captured by both scRNA-seq and high-content <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging. Across technologies, glioblastoma cells were placed along a neural stemness gradient against the neural progenitor marker Nestin and the mature astrocytic marker S100B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1b-g</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. S1). Concordant with previous literature using Nestin/S100B as glioblastoma markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, analysis of 25,510 single cell transcriptomes across three independent scRNA-Seq datasets revealed the highest co-expression of markers associated with malignancy (e.g. SOX2, CD133, EGFR, Ki67) and neural properties of glioblastoma (e.g. GAP43, NLGN3, CX43, GRIA2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e-g</xref>) in the [Nestin+ or S100B+ and CD45-] glioblastoma cell definition (n=22 glioblastoma patients; Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, this study; n=4 patients; Neftel <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, n=9 patients; Yu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, n=9 patients). Expression profiles of glioblastoma cells displayed high inter-patient heterogeneity within the Nestin/S100B spectrum, and were distinct from CD45+ immune cells present in the tumour microenvironment (TME; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c,d</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.S1). Cell-type specific enrichment analysis of gene modules enriched in Nestin/S100B/CD45-negative cells (‘All Neg’) confirmed the presence of additional TME cell types, including CD45-low tumour-associated macrophages/microglia, fibroblasts, and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1k,l</xref>). By immunofluorescence (IF), we quantified cell type composition and morphology for over 100 million imaged patient cells. This confirmed on average &gt;90% <italic>ex vivo</italic> viability of glioblastoma cells across the prospective cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h-j</xref> and <italic>Methods</italic>) and revealed a high degree of inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity: Across patients, glioblastoma cells ranged from 4-39%, immune cells from 1-82%, and all marker negative TME cells 13-84% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Imaging glioblastoma sample composition underscored the molecular tumour heterogeneity present within the Nestin/S100B spectrum and revealed a diversity of glioblastoma cell morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Glioblastoma stem cell morphologies prognostic of poor outcome</title><p id="P10">At the apex of the neural stemness gradient, Nestin+ cells represent a treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) subpopulation shown to sustain long-term tumour growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Visual inspection of Nestin+ GSCs disclosed recurring cellular morphologies (“morphotypes”) distinguishable by the presence of tumour extensions as well as cell size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,f-h</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S2). Using deep learning on 51,028 manually curated single-cell image crops across all patient samples, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify Nestin+ cells into four main <italic>ex vivo</italic> morphotypes (M1-M4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Single-cell feature maps extracted from the CNN and nuclei segmentation revealed a continuum of M1-M3 morphotypes and a distinct cluster of small M4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). M1 (polygonal with extensions; PE) and M2 (elongated with extensions; EE) GSC morphotypes had varying distributions of extensions per cell, largely overlapping with previously reported dimensions of tumour microtubes (TMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>) associated with glioma grade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. M3 (round big; RB) and M4 (round small; RS) morphotypes without extensions were characterized by their roundness yet differed in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Gap-junction protein CX43 and Nestin expression were higher in M1-M3 than M4, while similar EGFR expression and only modest differences in cell viability were observed among the four morphotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d-g</xref>). Across patients, GSC morphotype composition varied dramatically, with complex M1-M3 morphotypes ranging from 5% to 86% among Nestin+ GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To evaluate if this distinct contrast of patients with high or low <italic>ex vivo</italic> GSC morphotype complexity reflected <italic>in situ</italic> tumour organization, we imaged tumour regions in cohort-matched tissues from patients across the morphotype spectrum (M1-M3 high, ‘high complexity’, n=6; M1-M3 low, ‘low complexity’, n=4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.S3) by 100x confocal microscopy. Striking higher-level tumour organizational differences between the two patient groups were visually evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>), which coincided with significant stratification of multicellular immunohistochemistry (IHC) images by unsupervised deep learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). Subsequent single-cell image analysis of 12,799 Nestin+ cells and manual single-cell tracing demonstrated the presence of all four morphotypes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2j</xref>). Comparison of quantitative morphological features across 4,000 Nestin+ cells (n=400 cells/patient) further confirmed significant differences between the two patient morphotype groups: Larger and more extended cell morphologies were more abundant in the high complexity patient group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The morphological makeup of an individual patient’s Nestin+ GSCs was the strongest prognostic signal measured in our cohort. Higher baseline abundance of complex morphotypes (M1-M3% of Nestin+ cells) was associated with worse patient outcome (<italic>P</italic>=0.0047; n=17 patients with annotated PFS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>). The abundance of complex GSC morphotypes further correlated with Ki67 levels measured by pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2k</xref>). However, Ki67 levels alone did not stratify patient survival, nor did stratification based on IF marker-defined cell type composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2l-n</xref>). While <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status, a prognostic factor associated with response to alkylating agents, also stratified patient survival in our cohort (<italic>P</italic>=0.038), complex GSC morphotype abundance was independent of <italic>MGMT</italic> status (Fisher’s test, <italic>P</italic>=0.19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2m</xref>). These results provide compelling evidence that complex M1-M3 GSC morphotypes and corresponding <italic>in situ</italic> tumour organization characterizes particularly aggressive disease with poor clinical outcome among glioblastomas.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Therapeutically targeting neural tumour heterogeneity</title><p id="P13">The question arises whether it is possible to pharmacologically target the heterogeneous spectrum of glioblastoma cells in surgical patient samples, both in terms of neural stemness and morphological complexity. Image-based <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug screening (pharmacoscopy; PCY) enables measurements of drug-induced relative reduction of any marker- or morphology-defined cancer cell population. Positive PCY scores indicate a drug-induced reduction of cancer cells relative to non-malignant TME cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In previous clinical trials, PCY identified effective therapies for aggressive haematological malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. To evaluate the use of pharmacoscopy in glioblastoma, we measured <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug responses to first- and second-line glioblastoma chemotherapies (n=3 drugs) in patient samples from two independent patient cohorts: our main prospective cohort (n=27 patients) and a retrospective cohort (n=18 patients, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>, and Supplementary Table 1). Patient samples were either dissociated on the same day of surgery (prospective cohort), or dissociated after cell recovery from biobanking (retrospective cohort), and directly incubated with drugs for 48 hours. Limiting our analysis to newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients that received 1st-line Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment in the clinic, we found that <italic>ex vivo</italic> TMZ sensitivity of glioblastoma cells significantly stratified patient survival in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>), recapitulating higher TMZ sensitivities in patients with tumours with <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Despite the limited success of targeted therapies for glioblastoma, we additionally tested an oncology drug library (ONCDs; n=65 drugs; Supplementary Table 3) across a subset of our prospective cohort (n=13 patients; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d-f</xref>). This also retrieved <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug sensitivities concordant with prior clinical trials in glioblastoma: for example, the RTK inhibitor Regorafenib was among the top ONCD hits and has shown preliminary signs of activity in a randomized phase II clinical trial for recurrent glioblastoma, while the mTORs inhibitors Temsirolimus and Everolimus showed no efficacy <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in clinical trials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). When we explored associations between patient <italic>ex vivo</italic> ONCD responses and genetic alterations measured by targeted NGS, the strongest pharmacogenetic association was increased <italic>ex vivo</italic> sensitivity of patients with tumours carrying p53 mutations to the CDK4/6 inhibitor Abemaciclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). Taken together, our evaluation of standard-of-care chemotherapies and oncology drugs by pharmacoscopy demonstrates the clinical concordance of image-based <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug profiling for glioblastoma.</p><p id="P14">The majority of oncological drugs, however, have limited access to the brain and are designed to target the transformed nature of cancer. Neuroactive drugs (NADs), in contrast, are developed to cross the blood-brain barrier and act upon the nervous system. To find repurposable neuroactive drugs that target the neural stemness and morphological features of glioblastoma, we tested a panel of NADs (n=67 drugs; Supplementary Table 3) across the prospective cohort (n=27 patients) by pharmacoscopy. The NAD library consisted of drugs approved for neurological diseases such as depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease.

Such drug classifications, however, simplify the polypharmacological drug-target profiles of neuroactive drugs. The majority of NADs act on multiple primary target genes (PTGs). These include ion channels, GPCRs, and enzymes that modulate neurotransmission in the central nervous system, whose expression remains a largely unexplored dimension of glioblastoma heterogeneity. Dependency on neuroactive PTGs with high lineage specificity and consistent expression across patients could explain the activity of top NADs.</p><p id="P18">We therefore determined the expression of NAD PTGs by scRNA-Seq across the three independent datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a,b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

For detected genes, a higher NS indicates relative enrichment in neural lineage cells (range -1 to 1) and a higher PS (range 0 to 1) indicates more patient-specific expression, while both scores will be close to zero for low-abundance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). Ion channels and receptors with high neural-specificity included the calcium signaling modulator SIGMAR1, glutamatergic AMPA receptor subunit GRIA2, and cannabinoid receptor CNR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Patient-specificity for neurological receptors SIGMAR1 and CNR1 were on average 1.7 to 3-fold lower than for oncogenic RTKs EGFR and PDGFRA, despite similar detection levels.

However, these PTGs showing genetic dependencies were predominantly targeted by NADs that showed no anti-glioblastoma activity by PCY.

COSTAR effectively applies Occam’s razor to the collective biochemical drug-protein-protein interaction network, offering a novel conceptual framework applicable to all fields of drug discovery. Through COSTAR, we uncovered a convergence of AP-1 transcription factor activity and cell cycle regulation on BTG-mediated tumour suppression. AP-1 and BTG upregulation was a defining feature of the response to neuroactive drugs with anti-glioblastoma activity, where a growth-suppressing role for BTG1 was confirmed by functional genetics.

Using these lists as cell-type specific gene sets, we calculated an immune- and a neural score for each cell using singscore, and classified every cell in the additional datasets as either neural or immune based on a linear combination of both scores. To assess how specifically a gene is expressed in neural cells, we defined a ‘<italic>neural specificity score’</italic> as follows: [<italic>neural specificity = fraction of neural cells expressing gene – fraction of immune cells expressing gene</italic>] where we define expression of a gene in a cell as having any non-zero count. Thus, a positive score indicates that a gene is more often found in neural cells than in immune cells, and vice versa for negative scores. This score ranges from -1 (gene is expressed in all immune cells and no neural cells) to =1 (gene is expressed in all neural cells and no immune cells). Note that for low expressed genes, this score will be close to 0, reflecting the fact that we cannot make clear statements about cell type specificity for genes with expression values close to the detection limit of scRNA-Seq.

A tryptic digest was performed for 16h. Samples were then purified on Macrospin C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus). Phosphopeptides were specifically enriched using IMAC cartridges on the Bravo AssayMAP liquid handling platform (Agilent). In short, samples were dissolved in 160 μl of loading buffer (80% ACN, 0.1% TFA). Then, the AssayMAP phosphoenrichment protocol was performed with slight modifications in terms of washing volume and speed. After purification, dried peptides were resuspended in LC buffer and subjected to DDA-MS on a QExactive H-FX mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on an ES903 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 75 μm i.d. x 50 cm; particle size 2 μm). Mobile phase A consisted of HPLC-grade water with 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of HPLC-grade ACN (80%) with HPLC-grade water and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 250 nl/min using a non-linear gradient from 3% to 56% mobile phase B in 115 min. MS1 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC target value of 3e6 and a maximum injection time of 56 ms. The scan range was between m/z 350-1650. A data-dependent top 12 method was used with a precursor isolation window of 1.3 m/z. MS/MS scans were acquired with normalized collision energy of 27 at a resolution of 15,000. AGC target was 1e5 with a maximum injection time of 22 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30s.
