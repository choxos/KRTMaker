Protein function often involves transient functional conformations, which can be resolved using time-resolved cryo-EM (trEM). In trEM, reactions are arrested after a defined delay time by rapid vitrification of protein solution on the EM grid. Despite the increasing interest in trEM among the cryo-EM community, making trEM samples with a time resolution below 100 ms remains challenging. Here we report the design and the realization of a time-resolved cryo-plunger that combines a droplet-based microfluidic mixer with a laser-induced generator of microjets that allows rapid initiation of reaction and rapid plunge-freezing of cryo-EM grids. Using this approach, a time resolution of 5 ms was achieved and the protein density map was reconstructed to a spatial resolution of 2.1 Å. We performed trEM experiments on GroEL:GroES chaperonin complex, these resolved the kinetics of the complex formation and visualized putative short-lived conformations of GroEL-ATP complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteins sample a complex conformational landscape shaped by environment, ligand binding, protein-protein interactions, and charge exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

The practical realization of this approach resulted in the microfluidic chip and the integrated plunger device shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>.</p><p id="P9">In the microfluidic chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) two aqueous solutions are combined and encapsulated into microdroplets in the oil phase with a volume of about 100 pL. The content of the droplets is mixed by chaotic advection which is enhanced by passing the droplets through a winding channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We found that mixing efficiency exceeds 50 % in a serpentine consisting of three turns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The mixing was completed downstream of the chip upon droplet merging and spray generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (see below).

A pulsed laser focused on a microfluidic channel next to the nozzle is absorbed by a dye dissolved in the aqueous phase generating a bubble with a microsecond lifetime.

LIC has the advantage of local actuation tunable by varying the laser power and frequency while preserving the simplicity of the microfluidic chip design. We found that a pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (WL 532 nm, 6 ns) at laser power per pulse and per focal point of 4-10 μJ generated a stable spray when amaranth dye was used at concentrations above 8 mM.

A somewhat counterintuitive non-linear relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) is a well-known phenomenon in droplet systems, wherein the linearity is lost due to the discontinuous nature of the flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Despite the apparent invasiveness of LIC, its influence on protein integrity is limited.

More than 80 % of the protein activity was preserved. A continuous activity reduction from 99±1 % to 81±2 % was observed as the residence time decreased from 43 to 3 ms.

EM grid is mounted on an arm driven by a rotational voice coil which accelerates and decelerates the grid at up to 10<sup>4</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> while maintaining accurate control over the arm position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). The plunge time is programmatically set to any value above the minimum time of 2 ms. For a t<sub>plunge</sub> exceeding 100 ms, the plunger arm after spray deposition is lifted to the starting position in a local high-humidity environment to minimize the sample evaporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, 200 ms trace). The optimized profile of the arm acceleration maximizes the number of deposited microjets during the passage of the grid in front of the nozzle. The time of spraying on the grid varies between 4.6 ms, for plunge times above 80 ms, and 0.4 ms, for the shortest plunge time of 2 ms.</p><p id="P17">The sample consumption was minimized using a pulsed application of fluid flow synchronized with the movement of the plunger arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>).

We observed that the droplets spread fast on the surface of plasma-cleaned carbon holey grids, but many holes remained empty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). We assumed that this effect is caused by additional surface energy associated with droplets spreading over holes, and it can be mitigated by using a support film. After testing several support films, we found that freshly plasma-cleaned grids with an additional 2-3 nm thick carbon film improved droplet spreading and increased the number of holes suitable for cryo-EM data collection by a factor of 2 to 3 (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Areas with ice thickness below 100 nm were found on grids plunged with plunge times between 3 and 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>), and between a few hundred and a few thousand high-contrast images were collected per grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">For each time point, cryo-EM data were collected from two EM grids, and 3D maps of apoferritin and β-galactosidase were reconstructed to resolution between 2.1 and 3.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The mixing efficiency was assessed from the EM images by analyzing the distribution of the number of apoferritin and β-galactosidase particles per micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).

Interestingly, when the distributions of particle number per micrograph were analyzed for each protein independently, they were not following a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), expected for ideally behaving particles. Rather the distributions had a flat shape which suggested a more complex behavior.</p><p id="P23">As plunge times decreased, the particle distributions approached a Poisson distribution, which is particularly evident for β-galactosidase, whereas the average number of particles per micrograph decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).

The polymeric part of the chip was fabricated as a replica of a mold obtained by photolithography. The designed pattern was printed on a transparency mask with a resolution of 6 μm (Selba SA) and transferred on a silicon wafer coated with a photoresist. The photoresist (SU8 3050, Kayaku Advanced Materials, Inc.) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, using a Polos spin-coater (SPINl50i, SPS-Europe B.V.) to achieve a thickness of 50 ± 5 μm, followed by a soft-bake step on a hot plate for 15 min at 95 °C. Then the pattern was transferred by illuminating the photoresist through the photomask with UV light at 365 nm and power of 30 W for 7 s using mask aligner UV-Kube 3 (Kloé). The post-bake step was performed by placing the wafer on the pre-heated hot plate at 95 °C for 10 minutes. Then the un-exposed areas were dissolved with SU8 developer solution (Kayaku Advanced Materials, Inc.) for 8 minutes. During this step, the developer solution was continuously gently mixed on a shaker to ensure the removal of unexposed material from the pillar area. The resulting master was examined by an optical profilometer (Profilm3D, Filmetrics) to verify the structure details and the resist thickness. Next, the microchannels were formed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184 Dow Corning) through the casting of the uncured polymer against the master. The polymer base was mixed with a curing agent in a 10:1 ratio, to activate the cross-linking process. The mixture was poured on the master mold and then degassed in a desiccator for about 30 minutes or until all the air bubbles were removed. The curing was finalized by placing the polymer mold in an oven at 65 °C overnight. Then, the PDMS was detached from the master mold and access holes for the tubing connections were perforated using a surgical puncher with a diameter of 1.5 mm (Rapid-Core sampling tool, Electron Microscopy Sciences). In addition, the PDMS chip was cut at approximately 200-400 μm from the end of the edge of the droplet merging region transversal to the outlet channel to make the nozzle openings. Finally, the polymer device was sealed with a glass slide after exposing both PDMS and glass surfaces to oxygen plasma in plasma cleaner Cute (Femto Science) at base pressure 0.8 torr, power 100 W, process pressure 0.5 torr, and duration 1 minute. The glass slide with a thickness of 170-190 μm (Ted Pella, Inc.) was carefully manually aligned to the PDMS part of the chip under a stereo microscope to obtain a sharp rectangular opening in the chip. An average residual offset between aligned surfaces was estimated to be below 5 μm. Using thin glass facilitated the laser alignment and focusing during the chip operation. The assembled chip was kept on a hot plate at 180 °C for a minimum of 4 hours to render the PDMS surface of the channels hydrophobic, which was required for the stable formation of water in oil droplets.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Time-resolved plunger setup</title><p id="P48">The plunger device was assembled around a CERNA microscope (Thorlabs, Inc.) with a 5x objective (LMH-5X-532, Thorlabs Inc., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>).

The microfluidic chip was placed on a 3D printed holder mounted on a manual Z and motorized XY stage (MVS1, PLS-XY, Thorlabs, Inc). The grid plunger was designed to operate in the confined space of the microscope. An aluminum arm with a steel clip (Micro Serrefine Clamp, 18055-04, Agntho’s AB), used to mount EM grid, affixed to its end, was actuated by a rotational voice coil (extracted from Hitachi Deskstar HDS721010KLA330 hard drive).

The initial model was generated using a crystal structure of ATP-bound GroEL (PDB ID: 4AAQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>) converted to a 3D map and low pass filtered to between 30 and 60 Å.</p><p id="P67">First, the particles from time points of 50, 200 ms, and 20 s selected after 2D classification were merged, totaling around 700 k particles, and 3D auto-refined with C7 symmetry into a consensus map to 2.6 Å resolution. Next, CTF refinement was performed for symmetric and asymmetric aberrations, anisotropic magnification, and per particle defocus. A subsequent round of 3D auto-refinement in C7 symmetry using a mask generated by filtering the consensus map to 15 Å and extending it by 8 pixels with 8 pixels soft edge, generated a 2.4 Å resolution consensus map. The particles were 3D classified with the mask without aligning the particles, into 20 classes with C1 symmetry. T value of four was used for the classification. Classification generated six good classes which showed secondary structural features of GroEL, corresponding to different states of GroEL and GroEL-GroES complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Particles from each class were selected and split based on a time point. This generated a total of 18 particle sets. The particle sets were 3D auto-refined individually, resulting in 10 reconstructions at a resolution better than 8 Å. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The individual subsets obtained from class 3 refined to a resolution below 10 Å and thus were not considered further. Class 18 contained nearly 120 thousand particles in conformation assigned to GroEL-(ATP), but the particle subsets corresponding to individual time points refined to resolution significantly lower than those corresponding to the same state from class 9. Therefore, these reconstructions were not used further. We noticed, however, that the reconstruction of class 18 displayed small differences in the conformations of apical domains when compared to class 9.</p><p id="P68">Two good maps were obtained from a 50 ms timepoint. The first map, from class 9 assigned to the GroEL-ATP complex, was generated with 38,440 particles and reconstructed to 2.7 Å resolution with D7 symmetry. 2170 particles from class 15 were refined with C7 symmetry and produced a map at 7.1 Å resolution.</p><p id="P69">Refinement of classes corresponding to the 200 ms datapoint resulted in four reconstructions of different GroEL and GroEL:GroES complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs 7, 8b-d</xref>). Class 9 corresponding to the GroEL-ATP complex, with 231,968 particles, was refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å with D7 symmetry. The other three classes showed one or two GroES bound to GroEL. Classes 4 and 15, comprising 1433 and 17,592 particles were reconstructed with C7 symmetry and resolved to 6.3 and 3.4 Å, respectively. The fourth map generated with 27,784 particles from class 14 represented the GroEL-ATP:2GroES complex, it was refined with D7 symmetry and resolved to 2.5 Å.</p><p id="P70">Four states of GroEL and GroEL:GroES were refined from data collected at 20 s time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs 7, 8b-e</xref>). Particles from classes 9 and 14 were refined with D7 symmetry, whereas particles from classes 4 and 15 were refined with C7 symmetry. Class 9 contained 20,392 particles and resolved to 2.8 Å. Classes 4 and 15 comprising 4612 and 53,885 particles reached resolutions of 3.4 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively. The last map of the GroEL-ATP:2GroES complex, from class 14, was generated from 136,955 particles and refined to 2.3 Å resolution.</p><p id="P71">Data from the 13 ms time point were initially processed separately from the other time points. 57,914 particles were selected after 2D classification and refined to a consensus 3D map with D7 symmetry, after which the particle set was refined for asymmetric and symmetric aberrations, anisotropic magnification and per particle defocus. 3D auto refinement produced a map at a resolution of 3.8 Å. A mask was generated by filtering this map to 15 Å, extending edges by 8 pixels with soft edges of 5 pixels. The particles were 3D classified in D7 symmetry into 6 classes without alignment with a mask using the T parameter of four. The classification resulted in three classes populated with particles. The first class contained 26,156 particles (45 %) and refined to 3.2 Å. It corresponded to GroEL-ATP conformation, the second class contained 20,675 (35 %) particles and did not refine to high resolution. The third class contained 6480 (11%) particles and refined to 4.2 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8f</xref>), however, reconstruction from these particles corresponded to an intermediated conformation between GroEL-ATP and GroEL-ADP.</p><p id="P72">To check if this conformation exists in other datasets, the particle sets from other time points assigned to conformations without bound GroES, classes 9 and 18, were 3D classified separately (for each class and each time point) into 10 classes each in D7 symmetry without aligning particles. All good subclasses originating from class 9 corresponded to the GroEL-ATP conformation. Classification of 50 ms subset from class 18 produced classes corresponding to GroEL-ATP, GroEL-(ADP), and the intermediate conformation.</p><p id="P73">Classification of 200 ms subset from class 18, containing 84,629 particles, produced classes corresponding to GroEL-ATP and the intermediate conformation. The intermediate conformation comprised 6304 particles which auto-refined to 4.8 Å resolution. Classification of the 20 s subset from class 18 produced only one good class corresponding to GroEL-ATP conformation. The subset of 6304 particles was merged with all particles from 13 and 50 ms time points and classified with C7 symmetry without aligning the particles with the mask in eight classes using the T parameter of four. The classification resulted in four good classes showing the secondary structure of GroEL. In three of them, both heptameric rings were in ATP-bound conformation of GroEL. In one of the classes, both rings were in GroEL-(ADP) conformation. These particles were split per time point and refined in C7 symmetry. This resulted in the GroEL-(ADP) reconstruction at 4.4 Å for 13 ms time point and GroEL-(ATP)/(ADP) conformation at a resolution of 4.4 and 4.6 Å for 50 and 200 ms subsets, respectively. Because of the inconsistency between initial and refined conformations, an alternative classification was performed.</p><p id="P74">Only particles from 13 and 50 ms time points were pooled together and a consensus map at a resolution of 3.4 Å was obtained with C7 symmetry. A mask was generated by filtering the consensus map to 15 Å and extending edges with soft edges of 8 pixels each was used for 3D classification without alignment into 8 classes and with a T parameter of 4. Three classes with well-defined GroEL features were obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8g</xref>). Class 2 map corresponded to the symmetric GroEL-ATP conformation. The class 1 map had one heptameric ring in GroEL-(ATP) and another in GroEL-(ADP) conformation [GroEL-(ATP)/(ADP)], whereas reconstruction of class 8 corresponded to symmetric GroEL-(ADP) conformation. The particle sets from GroEL-(ATP)/(ADP) and GroEL-(ADP) classes were split into their respective time points and auto-refined separately. The GroEL-(ATP)/(ADP) subset of the 13 ms time point comprised 8252 particles that refined with C7 to 4.4 Å resolution, and the 50 ms time point comprised 7566 particles that refined with C7 to 3.9 Å resolution. The subset corresponding to GroEL-(ADP) conformations comprised 1947 and 2030 particles in 13 ms and 50 ms time points. The auto refinement in D7 symmetry yielded maps at a resolution of 4.4 and 4.0 Å, respectively. The final maps were sharpened by the Relion post-processing procedure and filtered by local resolution.</p><p id="P75">The identity of the complex conformations was established using high-resolution maps in which both GroEL conformation and bound ligands were unambiguously resolved. The GroEL-ATP conformation was further confirmed by the rigid body fitting of the GroEL-ATP model with PDB ID 4AAQ. The assignment of GroEL-ADP conformation was based on a comparison of the maps with the structure of GroEL-ADP complex, PDB ID 4KI8.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Kinetics of complex formation</title><p id="P76">The fractions of GroEL, GroEL:GroES, and GroEL:2GroEL complexes at each time point were estimated as follows. After the 3D classification step of combined 50, 200 ms, and 20 s datasets, as described above, of 6 good well-resolved classes, 2 classes corresponded to GroEL molecule, 3 classes to GroEL:GroES complex, and one to GroEL:2GroES. The particles corresponding to each complex were merged and side views with tilt angles between 35 and 135 degrees were retained thus excluding top views poorly discriminating the complexes. Then particles corresponding to each time point and each type of GroEL:GroEL complex were counted and normalized by the total number of particles from the time point. Similarly, after all the classifications, and high-resolution refinements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 7, 8</xref>), particle fractions of GroEL, GroEL:GroES, and GroEL:2GroES complexes were estimated taking into account only the particles contributing to high-resolution reconstructions (&gt;8 Å, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2b</xref>).

The mixture was passed through the microfluidics chip under conditions identical to those used for time-resolved plunging of the cryo-EM grids, i.e., the protein solution was encapsulated in the droplets, the droplets were merged, and the spray was generated using laser-induced-cavitation. The experiments were performed at different residence times in the microfluidics chip. The energy of the laser was set to 50 μJ/pulse and the frequency varied between 1500 and 5000 Hz. The ejected spray was collected for a range of protein retention times. To ensure that the proteins were exposed to only one laser pulse, pressure on the channels carrying the fluids and the frequency of the laser were adjusted such that the fluid shifted significantly between the sequential laser pulses maximizing the ejected volume per laser pulse.

Densities of heptameric rings were aligned then subunits were isolated and low pass filtered for clarity. The red zone shows the surface of bound nucleotide density. Insets show that in both ATP-like and ADP-like rings density of bound nucleotide is visible. The color code of conformations is like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. For the ATP-like model, the PDB model with ID 4AAQ was a rigid body fit into the map. For the ADP-like model, the PDB model with ID 4KI8 was used.
