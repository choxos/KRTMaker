After initial lesion formation during active demyelination, inflammation is gradually compartmentalized and restricted to specific tissue areas such as the lesion rim in chronic-active lesions. However, the cell type-specific and spatially restricted drivers of chronic tissue damage and lesion expansion are not well understood. Here, we investigated the properties of subcortical white matter lesions by creating a cell type-specific spatial map of gene expression across various inflammatory lesion stages in MS. An integrated analysis of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data enabled us to uncover patterns of glial, immune and stromal cell subtype diversity, as well as to identify cell-cell communication and signaling signatures across lesion and non-lesion tissue areas in MS. Our results provide insights into the conversion of the tissue microenvironment from a ‘homeostatic’ to a pathogenic or ‘dysfunctional’ state underlying lesion progression in MS. We expect that this study will help identify spatially resolved cell type-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future interventional trials in MS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>single-nucleus RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>subcortical lesions</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototypic and the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by multifocal demyelination, axonal damage and gliosis, ultimately leading to a loss of neurons across various gray matter areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. A major problem associated with progressive disease in MS is compartmentalized inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">An important anatomical niche of compartmentalized inflammation in MS is formed by inflammatory aggregates in deep meningeal sulci resembling ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures. It is widely accepted that sustained meningeal inflammation is a key factor contributing to cortical pathology and, particularly, resulting in neuronal injury of upper cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Another important niche area of chronic tissue damage and sustained inflammation in MS are subcortical white matter lesion rims (LRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Several postmortem and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated that these chronic active lesions are regularly accompanied by iron uptake at LRs, centrifugal lesion expansion and progressive disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A comprehensive understanding of the cellular composition and molecular dynamics of the lesion tissue microenvironment would have a critical impact on future biomarker and interventional studies in individuals diagnosed with MS.</p><p id="P6">MS lesions follow a well-characterized temporal sequence of the level and spatial pattern of inflammation and tissue damage, thus providing information about the lesion age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Acute MS lesions (MS-A) commence through active myelin breakdown with presence of myelin-phagocytosing cells including macrophages as well as activated microglia and astroglial subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. After this initial stage, lesions may either remyelinate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or enter a chronic active stage (MS-CA) with a distinct inflammatory LR and a well-demarcated completely demyelinated lesion core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Eventually, MS-CA lesions convert into an inactive stage (MS-CI) without LR inflammation but low-level microglial activation and a dense astroglial scar meshwork throughout the lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the precise lesion kinetics are not well understood, and it is known that chronically inflamed and iron-positive LRs can persist for years in certain individuals with MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Also, chronic MS lesions may convert into remyelinated lesions representing myelin repair in at least a subset of individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Remyelination might also remain incomplete and is then often seen adjacent to LR areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Over the past decades, histopathological and MR imaging studies have collectively provided deep insights into inflammatory lesion development and temporal lesion dynamics in individuals diagnosed with MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, due to a lack of spatially resolved molecular tools it has not been possible to discern spatially restricted areas of cell type-specific pathology and eventually map back these changes to defined lesion and non-lesion tissue niches.</p><p id="P7">Here, we utilized single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) paired with spatial RNA-seq (spatial transcriptomics, ST) to create a large-area map of gene expression covering lesion core and LR areas as well as normal-appearing white matter. Using a wide range of computational tools, we estimated the distribution of cell types across subcortical MS lesion areas, characterized tissue niches and identified spatially restricted cell-cell interaction and signaling pathway signatures. To facilitate the use of these results by the community, we have built an interactive single-cell and ST web browser to visualize MS lesion transcriptomics. Our spatially resolved gene expression underlying MS lesion development should help facilitate the development of region- and cell type-specific biomarkers and design targeted treatments to tackle compartmentalized inflammation in MS.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptomic profiling of human multiple sclerosis in WM</title><p id="P8">To unravel the transcriptomic signatures linked to the spatial environment in MS pathology, we characterized 7 control (CTRL) and 21 MS tissue samples. In detail, we focused on subcortical white matter tissues and performed ST on 17 tissue blocks (4 CTRL vs 13 MS) with paired snRNA-seq on the same blocks (3 CTRL vs 8 MS) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Tables 1-2</bold>).

For the paired snRNA-seq dataset, we obtained a total of 69,526 nuclei (n=11, average=6,321) with a mean of 2,042 detected genes per nucleus after filtering out low-quality profiles and potential doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>).

After batch correction (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), we could identify five major subcortical cell types including astrocytes (AS), endothelial cells (EC), microglia (MG), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), oligodendrocytes (OL) as well as six disease-enriched clusters including a new AS subtype expressing marker genes associated with primary cilia formation <italic>(CFAP299, CFAP43</italic> and <italic>SPAG17)</italic> that we annotated as ciliated astrocytes (AS-C). Other MS-enriched cell types were annotated as differentiating oligodendrocytes (OL-D), B cells (BC), macrophages (MΦ-MS), stromal cells (SC) and T cells (TC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). To corroborate our cell type annotations, we compared their transcriptional profiles to the ones from another recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> on human subcortical WM MS lesions and observed a high overlap between them (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Since ST captures multiple cells per spot, we increased its resolution by inferring cell type composition per spot (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).

Likewise, spatial distribution of OL cells across different MS lesion types was mainly restricted to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), as expected. Based on transcriptomic signatures, we could map MG and MΦ-MS cells to inflamed MS-A lesion core and MS-CA LR areas. Also, we could only map a few MG and barely any MΦ-MS profiles to control and MS-CI tissues. In MS-CA lesion areas, we additionally found a strong compartmentalization of both MG and AS cells restricted to DMWM areas. As compared to MG, MΦ-MS cells mapped to the rim of chronic active lesion areas with a characteristic high iron uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, e</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The resulting inferred cell type compositions matched well the cell type proportions observed by snRNA-seq, both at the sample and cell type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f</xref>).

By unsupervised clustering of spots from all tissue sections, we identified seven clusters that could be linked to major cell types and specific ST tissue niches (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Of note, the obtained ST niche clustering provides a comprehensive look into the structural transcriptomic assembly of the tissue blocks across controls and MS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To further characterize ST niches, we investigated cell type enrichment within each tissue niche when compared to other niches (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Here, we found two main groups of cell type niches. The first group (0, 2, 3 and 4) appeared to be enriched by OL cells and was restricted to NAWM and MS LR areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). The second group (1, 5 and 6) was enriched by AS and associated with DMWM areas. Niche 0 had increased numbers of OL, MΦ-MS and MG cell types and,mapped to inflamed lesion core and LR areas in MS-A and MS-CA typed tissues (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Niche 1 was enriched by AS and cell types like OPC and OL-D. Niche 5 was overrepresented by AS subtypes including AS-C cells. Finally, tissue niche 6 was characterized by cell type enrichment of AS, TC, BC, SC and EC subtypes and histologically mapped to areas with increased blood vessel density, suggesting a perivascular tissue niche associated with immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, Fig. 2i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2b</xref>). These results provide a wide description of cell type organization across all tissue slides.</p><p id="P15">To complement the identification of specific colocalization events based on tissue niche analysis, we next tested correlations between compositions of cell types in the same spatial spots across samples and lesion stages (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We found colocalizations between AS-C, OPC and AS, and between SC, EC, TC and AS cells. These colocalization events overlapped with the enrichment of these cell types in niches 1 and 6, respectively. A colocalization between OL, MG and MΦ-MS in niche 0 was also identified, suggesting potential engagement of myeloid cells in myelin breakdown.</p><p id="P16">To link these structural building blocks to molecular functions in tissues, we further described them by inferring signaling pathway activities at spot level across slides and lesions (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Niches enriched by OL (0, 2, 3 and 4) showed increased activity of androgen-related pathways (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.05), independent of gender (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Tissue niches overrepresented by AS (1, 5 and 6) presented higher activity for pathways involved in tissue remodeling and maintenance including PI3K and TGFβ signaling (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, niches 5 and 6 showed enrichment for proinflammatory pathways such as TNFα and JAK-STAT (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.05), suggesting roles in compartmentalized tissue inflammation.</p><p id="P17">We found that control samples did not show spatial tissue segregation, indicating a homogenous tissue niche composition with different glial cell types ‘stochastically’ distributed throughout the tissue section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a-b</xref>). OL cells were the main cell type in control tissues and showed spatial enrichment for genes associated with androgen signaling such as <italic>NDRG1</italic> and <italic>DBI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In lesion areas of MS-A samples, we found that MΦ-MS and MG cells were associated with TNFα signaling, a classic proinflammatory pathway in chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In MS-CA lesion areas, the inflamed LR formed a distinct spatial niche that separated NAWM from DMWM lesion core areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In MS-CA typed tissues we noted that certain tissue niches appeared to be enriched for mesenchymal SC and EC cell types linked to WNT and TGFβ signaling, as seen in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Overall, these results suggest that the MS tissue microenvironment is characterized by a dynamic cell type and tissue niche patterning driven by glial subtype-associated signaling pathways playing critical roles in tissue inflammation and remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural variation of subcortical tissue</title><p id="P19">Once we analyzed the tissue architecture across slides and conditions, we explored the differences between control and MS lesion type tissues. Principal component analysis (PCA) was computed to unbiasedly identify the main sources of variability based on pseudo-bulk gene expression profiles of ST tissue sections (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Of note, control samples clustered separately from MS ones. While we could not distinguish different MS lesion types, we observed a change in cell proportion and their spatial distribution in both ST and snRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data 2d, e</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). As predicted, numbers of OL cells decreased while AS subtypes increased during lesion development (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1). In acute tissue samples, we noted a high density of inflammatory cells such as MΦ-MS, TC and BC subtypes; as well as activated MG with LR mapping of these cells in MS-CA tissues (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1). Further, as predicted from histological assessment we found that AS cells localized to MS-CA and MS-CI DMWM areas. AS-C were overrepresented in all lesion types compared to control tissues (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1), providing additional insight into this ciliated and, potentially, functionally distinct scar tissue AS subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To further characterize changes in proportions across different conditions, we examined tissue niches as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data 2f, g</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>).</p><p id="P21">Indeed, niche 3, resembling a ‘homeostatic’ NAWM signature, was more enriched in control than in MS tissues (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1).

Tissue niches 5 and 6 were enriched in MS-CA relative to control tissues (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1), in agreement to their proinflammatory tissue profile. Here, we found a colocalization of TC and SC cell types, hence likely resembling perivascular immune cell cuffing in inflamed MS tissue areas as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, j, k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data 2h</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>).</p><p id="P22">By performing a thorough transcriptomic tissue analysis based on paired snRNA-seq and ST, we could identify tissue niche clusters that were linked to spatially restricted MS lesion tissue areas.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Characterization of MG subpopulations</title><p id="P23">Next, we focused on the molecular heterogeneity of MG cells, which is central for lesion formation and tissue injury in both early MS-A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and MS-CA lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

We then tested if the relative abundance of MG cells changed across lesion types (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, adjusted P &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). We observed that cell state 0 was overrepresented in control samples, suggesting that this MG subtype would be related to a homeostatic subtype strongly associated with NAWM tissue niches. Conversely, MG cell states 1, 2 and 3 were relatively more abundant in MS than in control samples, suggesting that these MG subtypes were linked to activated MG cells localized to inflamed MS lesion areas such as the LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data 3c</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>).</p><p id="P24">To better understand the obtained cell states, we next sought to identify marker genes per state (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).
