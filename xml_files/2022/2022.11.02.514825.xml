Gene characterization is often limited to the native species from which it was identified, but may offer benefits to other species. To understand if <italic>OsPSTOL,</italic> a gene identified from rice which improves tolerance to low P growth conditions, might improve performance and provide the same benefit in wheat, <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> was transformed into wheat and expressed from a constitutive promoter. The ability of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> to improve nutrient acquisition under low phosphate or low nitrogen was evaluated. Here we show that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> works through a conserved pathway in wheat and rice to improve yields under both low phosphate and low nitrogen. This increase is yield is mainly driven by improved uptake from the soil driving increased biomass and ultimately increased seed number, but does not change the concentration of N in the straw or grain. Overexpression of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in wheat modifies N regulated genes to aid in this uptake whereas the putative homolog <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> does not suggesting that expression of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in wheat can help to improve yields under low input agriculture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PSTOL</kwd><kwd>Phosphate</kwd><kwd>Nitrogen</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>uptake</kwd><kwd>N15</kwd><kwd>Nitrogen Use Efficiency</kwd><kwd>Phosphate Use Efficiency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">There is a strong desire to reduce inputs in agriculture to make large scale farming more sustainable and lessen our impact on the surrounding environment. Phosphorous and nitrogen are added in large quantities as chemical fertilizers in modern agricultural practices. Both elements are essential macronutrients which are required for all major developmental processes in plants and are key for both completing the life cycle and maintaining food production. Their mobility within the soil, mechanisms of uptake and the plant scavenge response to their limitation differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marschner, 1995</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which different plant species adapt to different abiotic stresses, including the regulation and expression of key genes and growth habits have enabled the design of more effective breeding strategies to produce highly resilient crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamuyao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Magalhaes <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Xu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). A number of the underlying genes involved in the response of plants to low P and N are highly conserved and play similar roles in a number of diverse plant species including both model system and crop species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Borah <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Thus, a greater understanding of the pathways involved, the key genes involved in P and N acquisition and signaling will allow breeders and plant molecular biologists to develop more efficient crops. Identification of these conserved pathways and genes from “model” organisms, and the subsequent transfer of this knowledge to crop species, would therefore allow farmers to optimize fertilizer use worldwide, resulting in increased efficiency of food production with lower environmental cost.</p><p id="P4">One such gene, believed to be important in increased nutrient use efficiency, is the recent identification of a key gene under the PUP1 locus from rice. The gene has been shown to be a serine/threonine receptor-like kinase, named Phosphate Starvation Tolerance 1 (PSTOL), is a major gene involved in tolerance to growth on low P soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chin <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamuyao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Heuer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Vigueira <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). The PUP1 locus was originally identified in an upland variety of rice, Kasalath, yet is absent from most rice cultivars including the current reference japonica variety Nipponbare and indica variety 93-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Vigueira <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Wissuwa <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>). Rice varieties which have this genomic introgression containing a functional PSTOL gene, show increased biomass, increased root growth, increased tiller number and yield increases of up to 30% when grown under low P conditions whereas no deleterious consequences were seen when grown under normal soil fertility conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chin <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamuyao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). The identification of OsPSTOL and its role in helping rice tolerate low P conditions has led to the belief that one could increase the PUE by incorporation of PSTOL type genes into many crop species. However when OsPSTOL was first identified the authors also suggested that other elements may also benefit from in increased root growth and make the plant more efficient to low nitrogen (N) conditions and drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamuyao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>), but as yet no data been presented to substantiate the possibility of a role outside of PUE.</p><p id="P5">Others have identified homologous PSTOL-like genes in both maize and sorghum, based upon QTL analysis and sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Azevedo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bernardino <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hufnagel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). Further evidence of the role of PSTOL-like genes in PUE has been supported through QTL mapping rather than direct molecular characterization of candidate genes. Criteria to identify other potential PSTOL like genes has included identification of protein domains such as ATP kinase domains and on DNA sequence conservation meeting certain bioinformatic cut-offs for genes underlying these QTL. Some of these homologues appear to have differences in their gene structure such as number and length of introns and UTRs. Despite the lack of a highly conserved gene in most plant species, it is critical to understand whether other <italic>PSTOL</italic> genes exist in other important crop species and if they can be exploited. Our previous study identified a putative wheat PSTOL gene <italic>(TaPSTOL)</italic> and characterized its role in PUE and other important agronomic phenotypes. As the overexpression of TaPSTOL was not able to replicate the yield increase seen with overexpression of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in rice, we suggested that either wheat lacked the other genes downstream of PSTOL to increase yields or a critical domain within the coding sequence itself was the reason for the lack of increased yields.</p><p id="P6">Here, we set out to test whether the differences seen in a plants ability to maintain yield on low P is due to the presence of the <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> or <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> genes <italic>per se</italic> or if other parts of an unknown pathway underlie the differences seen in yield increases. We also test whether expression of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> can overcome other nutrient deficiencies to see if the presence of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> is only beneficial to low phosphate conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cloning</title><p id="P7">The <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> coding sequence from EMBL (AB458444.1) was synthesized with a ribosomal binding site, CCACC, immediately upstream of the ATG start codon and flanked with gateway attL1/attL2 sites (Genewiz).

No significant difference was observed in N content of the TaOE-1 lines relative to WT wheat in the grain under any N level tested (p val. 0.31). Only OsOE-3 had significantly more N in the grain under 210 kg/ha treatments (p val 0.02) and no other direct comparison between a line at the same treatment was significantly different.</p><p id="P22">To understand if the N deficiency increased transcript levels of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> or if transcript levels are higher only in response to low P, we tested expression of both <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in the rice variety Kasalth by qPCR and <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> expression in Fielder. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> can be activated by low N growth conditions although this change in transcript level is lower than that of low P conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). But both low N and low P growth conditions significantly increased <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> expression in the roots of Kasalath rice plants. <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> expression was also measured in Roots of wheat cv. Fielder via qPCR and no change in transcript levels could be seen in response to N level relative to replete, although low P did significantly increase <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>LICOR</title><p id="P23">To understand how <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> activates enhanced biomass we measured the rate at which plants were able to fix carbon under low P or low N conditions. When measuring C assimilation rates under low N and low P no significant differences could be seen the levels of C being fixed under the given growth conditions or replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This was further supported by the levels of chlorophyll in the leaves of the treated plants as again no significant differences were seen between lines under each condition tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>N Uptake and Expression of N related genes</title><p id="P24">To further understand how expression of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in wheat is allowing for increased growth under a range of N conditions we studied direct uptake of N in the form of ammonium nitrate, with each N atom labeled as <sup>15</sup>N. When comparing rates of uptake in the roots of N deprived plants a significant difference in the amount of N being taken up per g of tissue was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This was found only in plants overexpressing <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> as no significant differences in uptake were seen in the roots of plants overexpressing <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> relative to WT roots (p val 0.13).</p><p id="P25">The expression of four genes known to be differentially regulated under low N conditions in wheat were selected to test the N-responsiveness at the transcript level of the OsOE line (OE-3), TaOE-1 relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) (Buchner and Hawkesford, 2014). The genes selected encode the high and low-affinity N uptake transporters <italic>(TaNRT2.1</italic> and <italic>TaNRT1),</italic> an N transporter involved in N translocation through the plant <italic>(TaNPF7.1),</italic> and glutamate dehydrogenase <italic>(TaGDH2),</italic> an enzyme involved in N remobilization in response to limiting carbon ©. Expression of a number of the genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic lines relative to WT Fielder. Measurements of <italic>TaGDH2</italic> transcript levels showed no significant differences in the roots of OsOE-3, TaOE-1 or WT. There was a significant increase in <italic>TaGDH2</italic> transcript levels seen in shoots of OsOE-3 compared to WT (pval &lt;0.001). For <italic>TaNRT1,</italic> transcripts in roots of OsOE-3 showed significantly lower expression under replete conditions (p val &lt; 0.001). Both OsOE3-3 and TaOE-1 showed higher transcript levels of <italic>TaNRT1</italic> in the shoots under both low N and replete conditions (pval &lt;0.001). Analysis of <italic>TaNPF7.1</italic> transcript levels in the roots showed similar expression to that of <italic>TaNRT1</italic> with only OsOE-3 showing significantly lower expression than WT (p val &lt;0.001). In the shoots <italic>TaNPF7.1</italic> transcript levels were higher under low N growth conditions in OsOE-3 and TaOE-1 relative to WT, but no difference in expression was seen in plants grown under replete N levels (p val &lt;0.001). The high affinity uptake transporter <italic>TaNRT2.1</italic> showed significantly higher transcript levels in the roots of both OsOE-3 and TaOE-1 under both low N and replete growth conditions (p val &lt;0.01).

In this work we set out to understand why differences in the expression of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> relative to <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> were seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamuyao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). To do this we created new transgenic material to make direct comparisons in a consistent genetic background and observe the transgene’s effects. From this we have learned that OsPSTOL can activate a conserved pathway in other cereal species and increase biomass production and ultimately yield under P limiting growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that wheat lacks a fully functional <italic>PSTOL</italic> type gene and that <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> is not the functional ortholog of OsPSTOL in wheat even though it is 92.7% similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). This is not that surprising as many different rice varieties including both reference varieties of japonica and indica also do not contain a functional <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Vigueira <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). The presence of a <italic>PSTOL</italic> type gene may have been selected in rice for under conditions for which wheat is not widely grown or has lost, as further mutations the near the N terminus of TaPSTOL locus reduced the N terminus of the protein. Or perhaps it was a chance event in rice and has never been present in wheat. This would fit with why no other direct ortholog of PSTOL has been found in any other species in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bernardino <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P27">It was found however that the benefits of overexpressing <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in wheat conferred increased yields under a range of N conditions. This includes under N levels approximately 1/3 that of what current best practices in the UK for some transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This mechanism of action seems to be by increasing biomass which leads to greater seed set. This was seen under both low P growth conditions as well as low N growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). To further understand how <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> expression conferred tolerance to low N measurements of uptake, tissue concentrations and expression of N related genes were undertaken. From this it was found that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> expression increased N uptake from the soil but did not change overall levels of N in the above ground tissues including the grain. This increased uptake of N was seen via differences in N regulated genes such as the high affinity uptake transporter <italic>NRT2.1</italic> the low affinity and N sensor <italic>NRT1</italic> and genes involved in N translocation <italic>NPF7.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) (Buchner and Hawkesford, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ho <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). This direct measurement of increased N uptake in plant overexpressing <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> is the first direct evidence that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> increases uptake of nutrients to help aid growth.</p><p id="P28">This increased uptake did not change other physiological parameters including carbon assimilation or increased chlorophyll content suggesting that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> helps plants take up or acquire more nutrients and does not alter perception of those nutrients unlike more recent reports involving altered brassinosteroid genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Milner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). We also show that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> transcript levels can be seen under low N levels further supporting a role for <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in nutrient uptake rather than just P directly. However this increase in transcript levels might be due to the cross talk of N and P in plants and not a direct activation of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> by a N sensing transcription factor per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Borah <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hong <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Medici <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Zhu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Overall, it appears that <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> is able to aid in multiple nutrient deficiencies in different plant species by helping acquire the nutrients which are limiting growth. It is tempting to wonder if a combination of genes such as the recently cloned <italic>OsNRT2.3b</italic> or <italic>SPDT</italic> in combination with <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> could dramatically increase grain production under lower inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Fan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Yamaji <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Suppl table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156658-supplement-Suppl_table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d151aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Funding statement</title><p>This work was supported by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/N013441/1 and BB/N013484/1.</p></ack><sec id="S20" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P30">Seed from transgenic lines is available upon request from the corresponding author.
