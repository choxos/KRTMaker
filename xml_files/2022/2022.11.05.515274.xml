Loss of body weight, including loss of adipose mass, is a hallmark symptom of African trypanosomiasis. Nevertheless, it is unclear which molecular mechanisms drive this loss of adipose mass and in turn whether it contributes to pathology. Here we show that lipolysis is activated early in infection in adipose tissue of <italic>T. brucei-infected</italic> mice. This activation is dependent on immune activation, as mice deficient for both B and T lymphocytes failed to upregulated adipocyte lipolysis upon infection and retained higher fat mass. Genetic ablation of the rate limiting adipose triglyceride lipase specifically from adipocytes in mice <italic>(Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</italic> prevented the upregulation of adipocyte lipolysis during infection, leading to reduced loss of fat mass and adipocyte volume. Surprisingly infected <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice succumbed earlier to infection and presented a higher parasite burden in the gonadal adipose tissue, indicating that lipolysis limits the growth of the parasite population. Collectively, this work provides molecular mechanistic insight into the loss of fat mass in African trypanosomiasis and identifies adipocyte lipolysis as a host-protective mechanism during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is an unicellular and extracellular parasite transmitted to humans and cattle through the bite of infected tsetse flies, causing Human and animal African trypanosomiasis (HAT and AAT), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Within the mammalian host, <italic>T. brucei</italic> colonizes both intravascular and extravascular spaces, causing a progressive wasting disease that is lethal if left untreated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The pathology of African trypanosomiasis is extensively modulated by the extravascular location of the parasite. This is well exemplified by the classical neurological symptoms observed in humans upon colonization of the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and, more recently, the skin lesions observed in HAT patients have been associated with the presence of <italic>T. brucei</italic> in the dermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The loss of fat/adipose mass, which occurs during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infections in the context of a broader wasting syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, may be associated with the parasite’s presence in the adipose tissue (AT). This possibility is supported by the fact that <italic>T. brucei</italic> accumulates in disproportionately high numbers in the AT of infected mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, in the gonadal AT (i.e. largest visceral AT depot), this colonization leads to a progressive accumulation of myeloid cells as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-producing lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Concomitant to the mounting of this immune response, AT depots undergo a progressive loss of weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that AT colonization by <italic>T. brucei</italic> and the ensuing immune response may be responsible for the loss of fat mass observed in African trypanosomiasis.</p><p id="P5">Loss of AT depot mass occurs when lipid catabolism is favored over lipid anabolism (i.e. lipogenesis), resulting in mobilization of acyl-glycerol species contained within the adipocyte’s lipid droplet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In adipocytes this mobilization occurs primarily through neutral adipocyte lipolysis, where triacylglycerol (TAG) is sequentially hydrolyzed into diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol by three lipases: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Upon hydrolysis of acyl-glycerol species, the resulting free fatty acids and glycerol molecules are exported to the AT’s interstitial spaces and subsequently into the circulatory system.</p><p id="P6">A myriad of stimuli regulate adipocyte lipolysis, including inflammatory molecules (e.g. TNF-α)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, sympathetic nervous system cues (e.g. norepinephrine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, hormones (e.g. insulin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and bacterial products (e.g. lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycans)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Proper regulation of adipocyte lipolysis is required for whole-organism energy homeostasis, especially during times of negative energy balance (e.g. fasting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, deregulation has been shown to promote the development of cancer-associated cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and hepatic steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Here we show that loss of fat mass during infection occurs due to an increase in adipocyte lipolysis, particularly through ATGL activity. Moreover, we show that the immune response is an important driver of adipocyte lipolysis and that in its absence, infected mice are more resistant to fat loss. Lastly, we identified two host-protective functions for adipocyte lipolysis: prolonged host survival and transient reduction of AT parasite burden.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> infection induces loss of AT weight and adipocyte area</title><p id="P8">Natural and experimental infections with <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites induce weight loss, which includes a significant loss of fat mass. To study the dynamics of this process, C57BL/6J mice infected with pleomorphic <italic>T. brucei</italic> and, at different time-points post-infection, animals were sacrificed and the gonadal AT depot (i.e. the largest visceral AT depot) was harvested, weighed and processed for histology. Infected mice showed a progressive loss of gonadal AT weight. By day 9 post-infection a 30% loss of gonadal AT mass was observed, which progressed to a 54% and 65% loss by days 16 and 30 post-infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess whether the observed loss of AT weight was associated with a reduction in adipocyte size, we analyzed Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin - stained sections of the gonadal AT at different time-points post-infection. A progressive reduction in lipid droplet size was observed concomitant with a previously described accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>). Quantification of lipid droplet area revealed an average reduction of 16%, 37%, 61%, and 69%, by days 6, 10, 16 and 30 post-infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Overall, these data show that during infection white AT undergoes a progressive weight loss that is correlated with a reduction of individual adipocyte sizes. In turn, This imbalance appears to favor the mobilization of stored intracellular fat over lipogenesis, leading to a reduction in adipocyte volume.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Adipocyte lipolysis is increased during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection</title><p id="P10">Next, we sought to identify whether loss of fat mass during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection was a result of increased adipocyte lipolysis. Gonadal AT from infected and control mice was harvested at different time-points post-infection and incubated <italic>ex vivo</italic> to allow for the release of lipolytic products (i.e. fatty acids and glycerol), which were subsequently quantified and normalized to the total amount of protein in the tissue. A significant increase in free/non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release was observed from the gonadal AT of mice infected for 6 and 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, by day 16 post-infection, a decrease in the release of fatty acids from the AT these mice relative to non-infected controls was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This later reduction in adipocyte lipolysis stems partially from a normalization bias that occurs at later time points of infection, as the AT becomes comparatively more protein rich as lipid stores are depleted and immune infiltration progresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Likewise, an increase in glycerol release was observed by days 6 and 9 post-infection, but not by day 16 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). On average the fold increase was for glycerol was higher than that observed for fatty acids. This difference may in part be due to glycerol secreted by the parasite, as significant amounts of glycerol are produced by <italic>T. brucei</italic> during glycolysis, especially under hypoxic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In line with this hypothesis, <italic>T. brucei</italic> cultures show a reduction of fatty acid concentration (i.e. C8 and longer) while accumulating glycerol in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">These results show that adipocyte lipolysis is activated during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Infection-induced lipolysis requires immune cues</title><p id="P13">Next we sought to identify the upstream signals responsible for activation of adipocyte lipolysis. In other contexts, adipocyte lipolysis can be induced by a myriad of distinct stimuli, including immune, neuronal and hormonal signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">First, we tested whether adipocyte lipolysis activation was mediated by modulation of sympathetic tone. To test whether sympathetic innervation contributed to <italic>T. brucei</italic> induced fat loss, we infected mice chemically sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxic analogue of dopamine. This compound acts by damaging nerve terminals of sympathetic neurons, preventing norepinephrine release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. No significant differences were observed in fat mass loss between 6-OHDA treated and sham treated infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that changes in sympathetic tone are not involved in loss of fat mass during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection.</p><p id="P15">Second, we tested whether infected animals were losing fat mass because of their feeding behavior. Indeed, we have previously described that there is a transient disease-induced hypophagia observed around the first peak of parasitemia (i.e. days 4 to 10 post-infection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To test if hypophagia is sufficient to induce adipocyte lipolysis, we employed two distinct experimental setups of controlled food intake: fasting &amp; re-feeding setup and a paired-feeding setup. In the fasting and re-feeding setup, we synchronized the feeding behavior of infected and non-infected groups by fasting them for 7 hours during peak activity hours, followed by a 2 hours re-feeding period prior to being euthanized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In these conditions, infected mice continued to show the same dynamic increase in the rate of adipocyte lipolysis during first peak of parasitemia, with a reduction after day 10-12 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B-C</xref>). In the paired feeding setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), infected mouse are allowed to feed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (i.e. unrestricted access to food) and the amount of consumed food of each mouse was weighed. These food intakes determined the amount of food provided to each pair-fed non-infected control the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). In this setup, infected mice showed again higher adipocyte lipolysis than their respective non-infected controls. Moreover, the non-infected paired-fed control did not show a significant increase in adipocyte lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F-G</xref>), suggesting that disease induced-hypophagia is not sufficient to induce adipocyte-lipolysis during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection.</p><p id="P16">As <italic>T. brucei</italic> induces both a strong systemic and local (i.e. within the AT) immune response, next we questioned whether immune activation was required for lipolysis upregulation. To test this hypothesis, we infected recombination activation gene-2 deficient <italic>(Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice which lack both B and T cells. These immunosuppressed mice present hyperparasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and usually succumb to infection by day 15 post-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Longitudinal body composition analysis of infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice revealed a clear reduction in the loss of overall fat mass when compared to infected WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, by day 6 and 9 post-infection while WT mice presented a 25% and 48% reduction in total fat mass, <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed no significant loss of fat mass. As infection progressed, <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed a modest loss of fat mass. Specifically, by day 12 post-infection <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had lost 14% of total fat mass, significantly less than the 37% loss of fat mass exhibited by infected WT mice at the same time.</p><p id="P18">To assess whether this higher retention of fat mass in infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice correlated with a failure to upregulate adipocyte lipolysis, we quantified the rate of release of fatty acids from gonadal AT explants of infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and compared it to both infected and non-infected WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C-D</xref>). While the rate of fatty acid release in infected WT mice increased by around 3.25-fold, relative to non-infected mice, the rate of fatty acid release in infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice increased by only 1.67-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). While AT of infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> showed a similar release of glycerol to AT of infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), this probably stems from an increase in parasite-secreted glycerol due to increased AT parasite burdens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mice deficient for TNF-α, a cytokine classically associated with <italic>T. brucei</italic>-induced wasting and a known activator of adipocyte lipolysis showed only a small delay in fat mass retention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that additional inflammatory factors are involved in fat mass loss and lipolysis induction.</p><p id="P19">Together, these data show that activation of adipocyte lipolysis is independent of mouse feeding behavior and it is not mediated by sympathetic nervous system nor by TNFα alone. Instead, we observed that loss of fat mass during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection is strongly dependent on the presence of T and/or B lymphocytes,</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loss of adipocyte volume is dependent on adipocyte ATGL activity</title><p id="P20">After establishing that adipocyte lipolysis is increased during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, we questioned whether we could revert the fat loss phenotype by genetically preventing lipolysis from being activated. For this, we used adipocyte-specific ATGL deficient mice <italic>(Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup>),</italic> which express a Cre recombinase under the control of the adiponectin promoter and have two loxP sites flanking the <italic>Pnpla2</italic> (ATGL) gene. Thus, these mice have no expression of ATGL in cells that express adiponectin (i.e. adipocytes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Using this model, we first asked if lipolysis could still be activated during an infection by <italic>T. brucei</italic>.

Specifically, we hypothesized that in the absence of ATGL activity infected mice would be unable to mobilize energy stored in the form of TAG within adipocytes. In turn, this could potentially be compensated by alternative catabolic pathways such as skeletal muscle proteolysis, which would precipitate the hallmark wasting phenotype observed during natural <italic>T. brucei</italic> infections. To assess this, we performed a longitudinal study of body composition by nuclear magnetic resonance, which allowed us to follow total body weight, lean mass, free fluid and fat mass.</p><p id="P26">Total body weight of <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> followed a similar profile, with an initial loss of approximately 5% during the first peak of parasitemia (i.e. days 5-8 post-infection), followed by a rapid recovery and relative stability until day 20 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Afterwards, total body weight declined for both WT and KO mice, with a trend for <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> to show lower total weight during the latest stages of infection (i.e. by day 30 post-infection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Similar to total body weight, a trend for comparatively reduced lean mass retention in <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This trend was observed as early as day 8 post-infection, and was kept throughout infection in spite of the overall increase in total lean mass observed in the following days. This increase in lean mass comparative to baseline peaked by day 12 post-infection and likely stems from hepatomegaly and splenomegaly observed during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">During infection, a clear increase in free fluid mass was observed in both WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), which was likely due to the formation of widespread edema that stems from the increased vascular leakage known to occur during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Importantly, significant increases of free fluid masses may act as a confounding factor when using total weight as a parameter for evaluating body condition of <italic>T. brucei</italic> infected mice.</p><p id="P29">Lastly, and as expected, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice presented significantly increased retention of fat when compared to <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). By day 8 post-infection, while <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice lost over 40% of total fat mass, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice presented only a modest 8% loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Afterwards, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice steadily lost fat mass, reaching an average 33% loss by day 30 post-infection – significantly less than the 49% experienced by <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed high AT mass retention until the latest stages of infection, as necropsy of moribund <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup><sup>fl/fl</sup></sup></italic> mice revealed significantly higher weight of gonadal AT depots than those of <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These data suggest that both ATGL-dependent and ATGL-independent mechanisms contribute to fat loss during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection.</p><p id="P30">Overall, these data suggest that ATGL activity in adipocytes during infection promotes loss of fat mass and potentially exerts a mild protective role in lean mass retention.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Adipocyte lipolysis prolongs host survival and reduces AT parasite burden</title><p id="P31">Having established that adipocyte ATGL plays a central role in fat mass loss during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, next we asked how activation of lipolysis affected disease progression. We hypothesized that given that <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> infected mice do not undergo loss of fat mass, animals would be more resistant to infection and would survive longer. Surpisingly, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice succumbed earlier to infection than their WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting a protective role for ATGL-mediated lipolysis during infection. This increased susceptibility of <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was not due to an increase in parasitemia, as absence of this lipase had no significant effect on the control of the first peak of parasitemia or during the latest stages of infection (i.e. 10 days preceding death) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P32">To understand how adipocyte lipolysis contributes to prolonged host survival, we questioned whether adipocyte lipolysis <italic>per se</italic> is able to modulate the number of parasites. As previously shown, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice did not show different blood parasite burdens when compared to WT littermate controls. This indicates that adipocyte lipolysis is insufficient to modulate number of parasites on a systemic level, but it does not exclude the existence of tissue-specific effects. Quantification of parasite load in the gonadal AT (by qPCR) revealed that the parasite number is 10-fold higher in <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice that WT littermate controls at day 10 postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). By day 20 post-infection, this difference in parasite load was no longer detectable, which correlates with the fact that lipolysis is no longer activated at stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). To remove any bias due to a higher AT mass typically observed in <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (i.e. due to loss of AT mass in <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, we normalized the number of parasites to total tissue mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). After this normalization, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice present on average a significant 7-fold increase in the number of parasites in the gonadal AT compared to <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls. This higher parasite load appears to be restricted to the AT, as no significant differences in parasite load were found between the livers, spleens of lungs of <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p id="P33">During a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, the total parasite load depends in part on a quorum sensing mechanism that triggers differentiation of replicative forms into non-replicative stumpy forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the higher parasite load detected in gonadal AT of <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice could be due to reduced parasite differentiation into the non-replicative stumpy form. To quantify the proportion of replicative and non-replicative forms in AT population, we infected <italic>Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with a parasite reporter cell line that expresses GFP when differentiation is triggered (PAD1::GFP reporter).

During the course of this study, we found that loss of fat mass and adipocyte size requires activation of neutral lipolysis up to day 9 post-infection, particularly through the activity of the neutral lipolysis rate-limiting enzyme ATGL. Moreover, we found evidence that this activation of lipolysis is tightly dependent on immune activation, as <italic>Rag2-/-</italic> mice despite having a higher parasite burden, show significantly lower activation of lipolysis and loss of fat mass than WT controls. Importantly, we showed that ATGL-dependent adipocyte lipolysis has an overall host-protective role in the context of a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, as in its absence, mice succumb earlier to infection and show higher AT parasite burden during the period of infection where lipolysis would be activated.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Impact of ATGL-dependent adipocyte lipolysis on body fat</title><p id="P36">In this work we have shown that during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection adipocytes become progressively smaller, in a process that involves an increase in ATGL-dependent lipolysis. Other studies have shown a similar role for ATGL in the loss of fat mass. Specifically, full ATGL-deficient mice are protected from fat mass loss induced by Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, burn injury-induced loss of body weight and adipocyte volume was partially prevented in <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in a model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, where significant loss of AT and total weight occur, <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre/+</sup>-Atgl<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were not protected from loss of total weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This suggests the relative relevance of ATGL in fat mass retention in infectious disease is pathogen-specific.</p><p id="P37">Increased adipocyte lipolysis is likely one among metabolic alterations occurring simultaneously. Indeed, work in the early 1980s using rabbits experimentally infected with <italic>T. brucei</italic> established a link between hyperlipidemia and reduced lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity due to increased TNF-α levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Here, inhibition of LPL prevented the export of lipids contained in lipoproteins from circulation and into the AT, leading to decreased lipogenesis.</p><p id="P38">Elevated TNF-α levels are often found in pathological conditions where wasting phenotypes develop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, treatment of several cell types, including adipocytes, with this cytokine promotes the upregulation of catabolic processes in detriment of anabolic ones, a phenotype often termed as cellular cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Although never formally tested, this collective body of work led to the logic conclusion that inhibition of lipogenesis may be central in the progressive wasting phenotype observed in during <italic>T. brucei</italic> infections. Recently, a greater appreciation of the complex inflammatory profile leading to the development of cachexia has re-framed the role of TNF-α as one of many inflammatory cytokines in the development and progression of wasting syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">Although it remains to be elucidated exactly how relevant LPL activity is in the loss of fat mass during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, our data suggests that TNF-α is not required to induce fat loss. Consistently, TNF-α deficient mice, which should retain significant LPL activity, showed only a small delay in loss of fat mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Indeed, our data show that fat loss and adipocyte volume reduction require the activation of adipocyte lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

On the one hand, even in absolute absence of adipocyte-lipolysis, a significant loss of total fat mass would still be expected, as most cells are capable of storing fats within cytosolic lipid droplets, which may then be consumed during infection. On the other hand, it is likely that even in the absence of adipocyte-ATGL during a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, TAG may still be hydrolyzed at a slower rate by HSL. This lipase is able to hydrolyze TAG, despite having 10-fold higher affinity for DAG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.

In contrast, a recent report found that changes in food intake in male mice correlate with weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

This immune-centric hypothesis is supported by the reduced loss of fat mass observed in infected <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and by their low <italic>ex vivo</italic> AT lipolysis upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P44">A multitude of immune factor, notably cytokines, have been shown to have a prolipolytic effect.

In a complex inflammatory scenario, such as a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, it is likely that multiple of these factors are simultaneously elevated. Accordingly, it is feasible that the observed upregulation of lipolysis stems from a combined/synergistic effect of these cytokines rather than a dominant effect of any of these candidates.

We found that parasite differentiation from the replicative to the non-replicative stumpy forms is not impaired in adipose tissue when lipolysis is blocked, suggesting lipolysis may be limiting parasite growth through an alternative mechanism. An overall limitation of parasite population results in lower parasite densities, which ultimately prevents activation of the density-dependent parasite quorum sensing mechanism that governs non-replicative stumpy differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">A possible mechanism through which adipocyte lipolysis reduces parasite density relies on fatty acid induced lipotoxicity. In this scenario, when lipolysis is activated, more free fatty acids are released to the extracellular space, which are endocytosed by <italic>T. brucei</italic> and could be toxic if they exceed the parasite’s capacity to catabolize these species through β-oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> or to anabolize them into relatively stable acylglycerol species stored into lipid droplets.
