Here we used K18-hACE2 mice and primary human airway cultures to examine the viral fitness and antigenic relationship among Omicron sublineages. In both K18-hACE2 mice and human airway cultures, Omicron sublineages exhibited a replication order of BA.5 ≥ BA.2 ≥ BA.2.12.1 &gt; BA.1; no difference in body weight loss was observed among different sublineage-infected mice. The BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, and BA.5-infected mice developed distinguisable cross-neutralizations against Omicron sublineages, but exhibited little neutralizations against the index virus (i.e., USA-WA1/2020) or the Delta variant. Surprisingly, the BA.5-infected mice developed higher neutralization activity against heterologous BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 than that against homologous BA.5; serum neutralizing titers did not always correlate with viral replication levels in infected animals. Our results revealed a distinct antigenic cartography of Omicron sublineages and support the bivalent vaccine approach.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since the identification of the first Omicron sublineage B.1.1.529/BA.1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in November 2021, several other Omicron sublineages have evolved, including BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.3, BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5, and BF.7. Among the early Omicron sublineages (BA.1-BA.5), some circulated at low frequencies (e.g., BA.3), most likely due to their low viral fitnesses; whereas others increased in prevalence (e.g., BA.1 and BA.5), competing with and displacing some of the previous lineages over time. After the initial BA.1 sublineage surge, the BA.2 sublineage, which was more transmissible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Marc Stegger et al., 2022</xref>), became prevalent. Subsequently, derivatives of the BA.2 sublineage, such as BA.2.12.1, became predominant in the U.S. More recently, sublineages BA.4 and BA.5, which encode an identical spike (S) protein, have become prevalent and caused epidemics in different parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Hachmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Qu et al., 2022</xref>). As of October 29, 2022 in the U.S., Omicron BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 descendant sublineages are projected to account for 3.0%, 9.8% and 87.0%, of the total COVID-19 cases, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions</ext-link>). The selective evolution of new SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages is mainly driven by two forces: (i) evasion of immunity elicited from infection and/or vaccination and (ii) improved viral replication or transmission in the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Frederik Plesner Lyngse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sandile Cele, 2021</xref>). Compared with all the previous variants of concern (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta), Omicron variants exhibited the greatest immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Kurhade et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Liu et al., 2021d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Liu et al., 2021e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sandile Cele, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Among the Omicron sublineages, BA.5 is least susceptible to antibody neutralization when tested against previous variant-infected convalescent sera or vaccinated sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Kurhade et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Xie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Zou et al., 2022b</xref>). Compared with the index SARS-CoV-2 isolated in early 2020, the S proteins of different Omicron sublineages have accumulated more than 30 amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Viana et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, for future vaccine development, it is important to understand (i) the antigenic relationship and (ii) the relative viral replication among different Omicron sublineages. In this study, we used a mouse model and a primary human airway cultures to address these two important questions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental rationale</title><p id="P3">For studying the antigenic relationship among different Omicron sublineages, it was challenging to obtain human sera from individuals who were infected with distinct Omicron sublineages without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. To overcome this challenge, we used a panel of sera collected from mice, which were infected with distinct Omicron sublineages, to examine their antigenic relationship. We infected K18-hACE2 mice with recombinant Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, or BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The selection of these four sublineages was based on their roles in causing Omicron waves after the initial BA.1 emergence. The mouse convalescent sera were examined for their neutralization titers against five Omicron sublineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4.6, and BA.5), a Delta variant, and USA-WA1/2020, the reference index SARS-CoV-2. The resulting neutralization titers enable development of antigenic cartography to illustrate antigenic relationships among various Omicron sublineages. Additionally, we could also compare the viral replication of various Omicron sublineages in K18-hACE2 receptor transgenic mice and in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Furthermore, the K18-hACE2 mouse model data allow comparison of pathogenicities among Omicron sublineages as well as to analyze the relationship between viral replication levels and neutralization activities.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Viral replication in K18-hACE2 mice</title><p id="P4">We constructed infectious cDNA clones for four viruses representative of Omicron sublineages: BA.1 (GISAID EPI_ISL_6640916), BA.2 (GISAID EPI_ISL_11253924.1), BA.2.12.1 (GISAID EPI_ISL_12115772), or BA.5 (GISAID EPI_ISL_11542604). The Omicron recombinant viruses were prepared using a well-established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Xie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). All four recombinant viruses were sequenced to ensure no undesired mutations. To compare viral replication and pathogenesis, we intranasally inoculated 8- to 10-week-old K18-hACE2 mice with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of each of the four recombinant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). No significant weight loss was observed for most of the groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), except one mouse from the BA.5 group lost &gt;20% body weight on day 11 post-infection and had to be humanely euthanized following an approved IACUC protocol. Different viral loads were detected in the respiratory tracts for different sublineage groups. The infectious viral loads in the lungs were in the order of BA.5 ≈ BA.2 &gt; BA.2.12.1 &gt; BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), while the viral loads in the trachea were in the order of BA.5 ≥ BA.2 &gt; BA.2.12.1 ≈ BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, the rank order of viral replication efficiency in the K18-hACE2 model was in the order of BA.5 ≥ BA.2 &gt; BA.2.12.1 ≥ BA.1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Viral replication in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures</title><p id="P5">To substantiate the K18-hACE2 mouse results, we compared the replication kinetics of BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5 on HAE culture. The HAE culture has been reliably used to study viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 variants, yielding results that recapitulate viral fitness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>). Competition experiments were used to directly compare replication kinetics of two sublineage viruses in HAE cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). A mixture of two viruses was used to infect HAE cultures. The relative replication of the two viruses was quantified by next-generation sequencing of the viral RNA population collected on different days post-infection. This competition assay has been reliably used to compare viral replication between variant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Liu et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Plante et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Shan et al., 2020</xref>). Our competition results showed that (i) BA.2 replicated more efficiently than BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>); (ii) BA.2 replicated slightly more efficiently than BA.2.12.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>); and (iii) BA.5 replicated more efficiently than BA.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>) and BA.2.12.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-I</xref>). Overall, the HAE results suggest the viral replication efficiency in the order of BA.5 &gt; BA.2 ≥ BA.2.12.1 &gt; BA.1.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cross-neutralization between different Omicron sublineages</title><p id="P6">To examine cross-neutralization and antigenic relationships among different Omicron sublineages, we collected sera from BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, or BA.5-infected K18-hACE2 mice on day 21 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Each serum was measured for neutralizing antibody titers against homologous and heterologous variant-spike viruses, including the four Omicron sublineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5), a recent Omicron sublineage (BA.4.6), the index USA-WA1/2020, and a Delta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E-H</xref>). To specifically study the impact of amino acid changes in the spike and increase the throughput of the neutralization assay, we engineered the full-length spike gene from each variant into the backbone of an attenuated USA-WA1/2020 that lacked open-read-frame-7 (ORF7), an accessory gene that is not essential for viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic> but facilitates replication <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Liu et al., 2022d</xref>). The ORF7 gene was replaced with the mNeonGreen (mNG) reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Muruato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). The resulting variant-spike USA-WA1/2020 mNG viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) were used for a fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT). The FFRNT assay has been proven reliable for high-throughput neutralization measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Liu et al., 2022c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Zou et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The FFRNT results revealed distinct cross-neutralization profiles for BA.1- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), BA.2.- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), BA.2.12.1- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), and BA.5-infected mouse convalescent sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Three conclusions could be drawn from the cross-neutralization data. First, the cross-neutralization titers against various Omicron sublineages were significantly higher than those against USA-WA1/2020 or Delta variant. The sera from BA.1-, BA.2.-, BA.2.12.1-, or BA.5-infected mice exhibited no or almost no neutralizing activities against the original USA-WA1/2020 or Delta variant, with FFRNT<sub>50</sub>s &lt;20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E-H</xref>), indicating the antigenic divergence among these variants. Second, sera from different Omicron sublineage infections showed distinct neutralizing patterns against homologous and heterologous variant-spike SARS-CoV-2. BA.1-, BA.2.-, and BA.2.12.1-infected animals developed higher neutralizing titers against homologous variants than those against hetereologous variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E-G</xref>), illustrating that they are antigenicially distinguishable from each other. In contrast, BA.5-infected mice developed higher neutralization titers against heterologous BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 variants than against the homologous BA.5 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Third, serum-neutralizing titers did not necessarily correlate with viral replication levels in the respiratory tracts of infected animals. This is exemplified by BA.2.12.1 which replicated less efficiently than BA.2 and BA.5 in both lungs and tracheas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C &amp; D</xref>), but elicited higher neutralizing titers than the BA.2 and BA.5 viruses(Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1F &amp; H</xref>). This result also suggests that BA.2.12.1 may be more immunogenic than BA.1, BA.2., and BA.5. The higher immunogenicity of BA.2.12.1 could be determined by mutations inside and/or outside the S gene.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cross-protection of BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, or BA.5-infected mice against Omicron BA.5 challenge</title><p id="P8">BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 was used to challenge K18-hACE2 mice that were immunized by infection with BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, or BA.5 variants for two reasons: (i) BA.5 was the most prevalent sublineage around the world at the time of the experiment and (ii) BA.5 was the least neutralized sublineage among the tested Omicron sublineages by the BA.1- and BA.2-infected mouse sera. On day 38 after the initial BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, or BA.5 infection/immunization, the mice were intranasally inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of recombinant BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The mock-immunized group developed mean titers of 7.3×10<sup>7</sup> PFU/g and 2.1×10<sup>5</sup> PFU/g of infectious BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 on day 2 post-challenge in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and tracheas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>), respectively. In contrast, only a few BA.1-immunized mice developed low titers of infectious BA.5 virus in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and tracheas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). No infectious viruses were detected in the respiratory tracts of the BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, or BA.5-immunized animals after BA.5 challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I-J</xref>). To increase the detection sensitivity, we also performed quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the viral RNA in the respiratory tracts after the challenge. Compared with the mock-immunized group, the BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, and BA.5-infected groups showed 223-, 2,253-, 4,816-, and 27,702-fold reduction of viral RNA in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>) and 21-, 290-, 242-, and 1,157-fold reduction in nasal turbinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>), respectively, after the BA.5 challenge. The decreased levels of BA.5 RNA reversely correlated with the neutralizing titers against BA.5. Specifically, the BA.1- and BA.2-infected sera developed low neutralizing titers of 26 and 62, respectively; these mice developed high BA.5 RNA levels in the respiratory tract after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1K-L</xref>). In contrast, the BA.2.12.1- and BA.5-infected sera showed higher neutralization titers of 471 and 375, respectively; these mice developed lower BA.5 RNA levels in the respiratory tracts.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Antigenic analysis of neutralization titers against variant spikes</title><p id="P9">Using the neutralizing titer results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E-H</xref>, we created antigenic maps to visualize the relationships between sera collected from infected mice against SARS-CoV-2 variants and Omicron sublineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). FFRNT titers were used to position the serum relative to each virus using antigenic cartography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Each antigenic gridline of the map corresponds to a 2-fold difference in the neutralization titer of a given virus. The cartography illustrated that mouse sera raised to Omicron sublineage variants are antigenically related, with the BA.2 reference being central to the group. Additionally, they formed a new antigenic cluster distinct from the index virus or delta variant (&gt;16-fold titer difference). BA.1-raised mouse antisera exhibited a diverse range in both homologous and heterologous FFRNT<sub>50</sub> responses, with some sera showing BA.1 specific reactivity and others demonstrating further cross-reactivity to BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 viruses and limited cross-reactivity to BA.4.6 and BA.5 viruses. In contrast, BA.2- and BA.2.12.1-raised mouse antisera demonstrated broader neutralizing responses (≤8-fold reduction) to all Omicron sublineages tested. While BA.5-raised mouse antisera exhibited good cross reactivity to BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4.6 viruses, they had reduced reactivity to BA.1 virus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussions</title><p id="P10">For any emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant, it is important to monitor their viral transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasion. A systematic analysis of the antigenic relationship among variants provides the scientific basis for future vaccine design. We previously showed distinct cross-neutralization and protection among Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron BA.1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Liu et al., 2022c</xref>). The current study extends the cross-neutralization analysis to the recently emerged Omicron sublineages, including BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4.6, and BA.5. Our antigenic cartography shows that all Omicron sublineages to date are antigenically related to each other and clearly form a new cluster/group from the variants that caused previous global epidemics (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., index, alpha, delta). The antigenic distance between the index virus and the currently prevalent Omicron BA.5 supports the recommendation for bivalent vaccines containing Omicron variants and suggests that BA.5 should increase the breadth of immunity particularly against decendent lineages or BA.2. Indeed, preliminary clinical results showed that, compared with the original mRNA vaccine, the BA.5-modified bivalent booster elicited more robust neutralization against BA.5 virus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-early-data-clinical">https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-early-data-clinical</ext-link>).</p><p id="P11">For viral replication, the K18-hACE2 mouse data and HAE results consistently suggest the viral fitness in the order of BA.5 ≥ BA.2 ≥ BA.2.12.1 &gt; BA.1. However, no significant difference in weight loss was observed among different sublineage-infected mice. These results indicate that, compared with the initial BA.1, BA.5 has increased viral fitness without increasing disease severity. Our results are in agreement with the clinical observations that (i) BA.1- and BA.5-infected patients develop similar disease severity and (ii) Omicron causes less severe disease than the previous Delta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Wolter et al., 2022</xref>). The reduced disease severity of Omicron infection may be caused by the lower cell-to-cell fusion activity mediated by the Omicron S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Meng et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the increased viral fitness and immune evasion of BA.5 may account for its dominance over other Omicron sublineages in circulation.</p><p id="P12">Our study has two limitations. First, we have not defined the mutations that determine the differences in viral fitness and/or immune evasion among different Omicron sublineages. These determinants are most likely within the S gene; however, mutations out-side the S gene may also contribute to the observed differences. Second, we have not analyzed cell-mediated immunity or non-neutralizing antibodies.

were infected via intra nasal (i.n.) route with infectious clone derived BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1 or BA.5. On day 21 post-infection, mice sera were collected and cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants was measured by FFRNT. On day 38 post-primary infection, all mice were rechallenged with BA.5. Two days after the challenge, mice were euthanized, and tissue viral loads were quantified. (B) Mouse body weight after primary infection. Daily body weight was normalized to the initial body weight. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). (C) Lung viral loads after day 2 post-infection. (D) Trachea viral loads after day 2 post-infection. (E) FFRNT<sub>50</sub>s of BA.1-infected mouse sera. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection (1:20 dilution). The bar heights and the numbers above indicate geometric means of neutralizing titers (GMT). The whiskers indicate 95% CI. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was performed for group comparison of GMTs.
