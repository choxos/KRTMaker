The activity and availability of HIF proteins is primarily driven by the stability of the HIF alpha subunits. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that preferential translation of HIF1α mRNA is also necessary for full activation of the HIF1-dependent hypoxic response. Consequently, the mechanisms controlling HIF1α translation are of equivalent importance to the proline hydroxylase-dependent degradation pathways. Here we investigate the role of the 5’UTR of the HIF1α mRNA in controlling preferential translation of endogenous HIF1α in hypoxic cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of the 5’ UTR of HIF1α results in reduced HIF1α levels following hypoxia, without alteration in mRNA or protein stability. HIF1α mRNA lacking the 5’UTR was efficiently translated in adequately oxygenated cells but this was inhibited during hypoxia, consistent with the global block on protein synthesis. The HIF1α translational defect observed in cells missing the 5’UTR led to reduced viability in hypoxic conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> and an impaired ability to form solid tumours in murine xenografts. Prevention of preferential HIF1α translation limits the duration and intensity of the HIF-dependent hypoxic response and disrupts the formation of solid tumours. Together these results demonstrate the importance of translation control over HIF1α and suggest that strategies to inhibit preferential HIF1α protein translation in hypoxic cancer cells will be an effective strategy to limit the growth of solid hypoxic tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hypoxia can occur as a consequence of low atmospheric oxygen or locally in tissues due to inflammation, ischemia, injury, or poor vascularisation, something that particularly evident in solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. As cells encounter hypoxia there is an adaptive switch in energy metabolism coupled with a rapid change in the gene expression program to restore oxygen homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Hypoxia-dependent changes in translation rates and protein degradation rates are described in many studies but how cells select mRNAs for preferential translation in hypoxic cells is not yet well-understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Cells can either control mRNA translation on a global level, with the translation of the bulk of the mRNAs being regulated <italic>en masse</italic>, or be mRNA specific, wherein the translation of stress-responsive and adaptative mRNAs are modulated in a more precise manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Since insufficient oxygen in hypoxic cells results in decreased capacity for energy production there is a general suppression of energy expensive processes such as protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Hypoxia-dependent repression of protein synthesis occurs mostly at the levels of translation initiation, generally considered to be the rate-limiting step of protein translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, while cells are conserving energy by limiting non-essential processes, mRNAs of stress-responsive genes must be actively translated to promote the expression of genes essential to the adaptive response to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The cellular signalling pathways that determine this selection, and the defining characteristics of the individual mRNAs that control their translation rates, are not well-understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P4">One of the best-described mRNAs preferentially translated during hypoxia encodes the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 transcription factor (HIF1α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. HIF1 increases the expression of genes involved in diverse biological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Many of the most prominent and well-characterised targets are involved in the regulation of oxygen supply and utilisation via angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Regulation of HIF activity has mainly been studied at the level of protein stability of the HIF1α subunit. HIF1α stability is regulated by several proline hydroxylases (PHDs), which modify proline residues in the oxygen- dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Hydroxylated HIF1α is recognised by the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) E3-ubiquitin ligase, which promotes the ubuiquitination and subsequent degradation of HIF1α by the 26S proteasome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. During hypoxia PHDs are inhibited resulting in rapid HIF1α accumulation, this allows HIF1α to dimerise with HIF1β to promote the expression of HIF target genes. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. However, despite its much-increased half-life during hypoxia, studies have shown that HIF1α needs to be preferentially translated to sustain high HIF levels during prolonged hypoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Translational control of individual mRNAs can be regulated by the non-coding regions at both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the transcript that can bind to regulatory proteins that control ribosome recruitment and translational initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Several studies using artificial reporter constructs have indicated that both the 5’ and 3’ UTRs of HIF1α can modulate translation rates through acting as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), sites to recruit RNA binding proteins, or act as targets for miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, the primary role for the endogenous HIF1α 5’UTR remains unclear, with conflicting studies using reporter constructs suggesting it represses translation through its complicated secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], or activates translation by binding to specialised RNA-binding proteins to facilitate ribosome recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. As more recent work using genome editing approaches has indicated that reporter constructs investigating the role of UTRs do not always phenocopy the role of the endogenous UTRs in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], we decided to modify the endogenous HIF1α 5’UTR in cells to investigate its function.</p><p id="P6">In this study we have investigated the consequences of uncoupling endogenous HIF1α from translational control in the cellular response to low oxygen in cell. Using a dual CRISPR/Cas9 strategy we determined the effects of deleting the 5’UTR of HIF1α in cultured cell lines. HIF1α 5’UTR deletion results in impaired hypoxia-induced HIF activity in cells. Furthermore, cells deleted for HIF1α 5’UTR demonstrate reduced solid tumour formation through impaired HIF1α translation rates. This study offers a genetic proof of principle that targeting HIF1α translation rates may be a strategy to suppress hypoxia-dependent gene expression in HIF-dependent human pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P7">PC-3 cells were grown in RPMI with 25mM HEPES, supplemented with 10% FBS and l-glutamine.

Intriguingly, deletions from independent clonal cell lines had the same 195bp deletion, corresponding to a single major deletion product observed in the transient transfections with the dual gRNAs, indicating a consistent mechanism of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To examine if the reduced HIF1α phenotype was maintained after clonal selection, hypoxia-induced HIF1α accumulation during hypoxia was measured by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). As observed when cells were transiently transfected, 2 independent HIF1α 5’UTR deletion clones had an impaired level of HIF1α accumulation in response to hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, levels of hypoxia-induced NDRG1 and BNIP3L were reduced at both the protein and mRNA level indicating that the HIF1α 5’UTR is necessary for the full HIF1-dependent hypoxic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). These data show that during clonal selection there was no compensatory adaptation to reverse defective HIF1α accumulation following hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Polysome profiling was then performed to examine the effect of HIF1α mRNA 5’UTR deletion on protein translation rates in response to low oxygen. A significant decrease in global translational efficiency was observed in wildtype PC-3 cells exposed to hypoxic stress, as indicated by the large increase in mRNAs associated with monosomal fractions, and a concomitant decrease in the number of mRNAs associated with polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). A similar block in global protein synthesis rates was observed in cells missing the HIF1α 5’UTR indicating the 5’UTR of HIF1α mRNA has no overt effect on global protein translation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To investigate the levels of individual mRNAs associated with actively translating ribosomes, cDNAs were prepared from fractions containing polysomes (Fractions 8–11) and compared to relative quantities of mRNAs in the input samples. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of polysome-associated HIF1α mRNA revealed that HIF1α translation rates increased in hypoxic wildtype PC-3 cells, compared to normoxic cells, confirming that HIF1α mRNA is preferentially translated during hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, translation rates of HIF1α in Δ5’UTR PC-3 cells were markedly impaired during hypoxia, demonstrating that the 5’UTR plays an important role in directing preferential HIF1α mRNA translation during hypoxia stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data suggest that genetic deletion of the 5’UTR uncouples HIF1α mRNA from translational control.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>HIF1α mRNA/ YB-1 interaction is disrupted in Δ5’UTR cells</title><p id="P28">The 5’UTR of several stress-inducible factors can bind to RNA-binding proteins which alter translation rates by modulating ribosome recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Several regulatory factors have been identified that enhance or reduce HIF1α translation by directly binding to the HIF1α mRNA 5’UTR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. We and others have previously described a central role for the Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) in binding to the HIF1α 5’UTR and promoting HIF1α translation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis of YB-1 levels from PC-3 WT and Δ5’UTR cells either cultured in normal oxygen conditions or hypoxia revealed no significant changes in total YB-1 levels between cell lines, or in response to hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). As total levels of YB-1 are unchanged, we investigated if the YB-1/ HIF1α mRNA interaction is disrupted by deletion of the HIF1α 5’UTR. cDNA prepared from YB-1 precipitates and analysed by qRT-PCR revealed an increased association between YB-1 and HIF1α mRNA in hypoxia is supported by previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and highlights its role in directing hypoxia-induced HIF1α translation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Cells expressing HIF1α mRNA lacking the 5’UTR lost the HIF1α mRNA/ YB-1 interaction, which was no longer induced by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The reduction of the HIF1α mRNA/ YB-1 interaction is consistent with the observed reduction in hypoxia-induced HIF1α mRNA translation rates observed in the Δ5’UTR cell lines and indicates that key regulatory protein interaction sites are removed from HIF1α mRNA missing the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Deletion of the HIF1α 5’UTR sensitises cells to hypoxic stress</title><p id="P29">Genetic deletion of the endogenous HIF1α 5’UTR allows analysis of the cellular consequences of disrupting translational control of HIF1α <italic>in vivo</italic>. In normal oxygen conditions, deletion of the HIF1α UTR did not alter cellular proliferation rates consistent with cells remaining well oxygenated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). However, when proliferation rates were measured in cells grown at 1% O<sub>2</sub>, Δ5’UTR cells had a markedly reduced proliferation rate, as compared to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). This suggests that the reduced HIF1 activity in Δ5’UTR cells has a negative effect on proliferation rates, and/or cellular viability in cells grown in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated whether deletion of the 5’UTR of HIF1α could impair PC-3 cell colony-forming ability after hypoxic stress. Wildtype or Δ5’UTR PC-3 cells were cultured in normoxic conditions or 24h in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and then seeded at low density to examine colony formation ability. Removal of the HIF1α 5’UTR had no significant effect on PC-3 cells cultured in normoxia to form colonies, however cells missing the 5’UTR of HIF1α mRNA had a significantly reduced ability to form colonies following hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). These data suggest that removal of the 5’UTR of HIF1α mRNA from cells reduces viability in response to hypoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>5’UTR deletion reduced tumour formation in tumour models</title><p id="P30">In solid tumours activation of hypoxia-responsive signalling pathways contributes to the malignant phenotype by promoting the expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-survival gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].

To test the role of the endogenous HIF1α 5’UTR on the formation of solid tumours <italic>in vivo</italic> we implanted WT and Δ5’UTR PC-3 cells into the flank of nude mice. Tumour volume was measured by callipers over a 3-week period. Both wildtype and Δ5’UTR PC-3 cells initially form tumours at equivalent rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and all mice maintained consistent, healthy bodyweights (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>)). However, approximately 12-14 days post implantation, Δ5’UTR PC-3 derived tumours started to regress, while WT tumours keep growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Upon study termination, both tumour volume and weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-D</xref>) confirmed that WT tumours were larger than those containing Δ5’UTR PC-3 cells, with one mouse appearing to have undergone a complete tumour regression. Interestingly, we also found that DNA damage (as measured by γH2AX staining) was increased in the WT PC3 tumours, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This may suggest that these tumours are more genomically unstable and have a higher rate of cell turnover than the cells within the Δ5’UTR PC-3, which would be consistent with continued growth of the WT tumours but not the Δ5’UTR PC-3 counterparts.</p><p id="P31">Collectively our data reveal that the 5’UTR of the HIF1α mRNA is necessary for full activation of the HIF-dependent hypoxic response and solid tumour formation in vivo.

Most studies examining how HIF is deregulated have focused on protein degradation, however the contribution of HIF1α translation rates, and the underlying mechanistic control is rarely considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The results from the present study, for the first time, directly measure the contribution of targeted control of mRNA translation in the regulation of the HIF-dependent hypoxic response in both 2D cell culture and the formation of solid tumours. Our work clearly demonstrates the importance of HIF1α translation control for its function.</p><p id="P33">Translational regulation of mRNA is an understudied, yet critically important step in the control of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. A number of stresses including starvation, heat/ cold shock, DNA damage, and hypoxia, lead to changes in gene expression patterns caused by a general shutdown and reprogramming of protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, cells have mechanisms to ensure mRNAs from stress-responsive genes are translated to restore homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In this study we interrogated the role for the 5’UTR of the HIF1α mRNA in regulating HIF1α mRNA translation rates during hypoxia. We found that CRISPR/Cas9-dependent deletion of the 5’UTR of the HIF1α mRNA removes HIF1α mRNA from hypoxia-dependent translational control, resulting in attenuated HIF-dependent gene expression. HIF1α mRNA lacking this 5’UTR is no longer efficiently translated in hypoxic cells, leading to impaired HIF activity and reduced cell survival during hypoxic stress. Cell unable to preferentially translate HIF1α in response to hypoxia are unable to form large solid tumours in murine xenografts.</p><p id="P34">The translation machinery can respond to an array of cis-acting elements, located on the RNA transcript, which dictate the fate of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. These include not only the 5’ UTR, but also the 3’UTR and a variety of post-transcriptional modifications that can ultimately contribute to translation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Our work has shown that the 5’UTR of HIF1α mRNA is necessary for the HIF-dependent hypoxic response by regulating HIF1α mRNA association with polysomes and regulatory proteins such as YB-1. In addition other work has shown the 3’ UTR of HIF1α also plays a positive role in regulating HIF1α mRNA translation rates by recruiting several translation initiations factors, including eiF3 and DHX29, which unwind the 5’UTR during translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. This work indicates that the 5’ and 3’ HIF1α UTRs act in concert to control HIF1α protein translation, indicating that examining the roles of UTRs in the context of an artificial reporter construct may miss the full picture of regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Proof of principle studies using siRNA and genetic deletion of HIF1α showed that reducing HIF1 activity in solid tumours inhibits primary tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. As such chemical manipulation of the HIF pathway by small molecule modulators is widely perceived as a promising strategy to target diseases associated with HIF dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].

Our work using a tractable genetic model gives insights into both the mechanisms behind HIF1α translational control, and the consequences of disrupting it. Targeting translation factors that control hypoxia dependent gene expression, such as YB-1, is an efficient strategy to suppress HIF activity during solid tumour growth and development. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that YB-1 acetylation could limit tumour metastasis, in part by blocking translational activation of HIF1α and other cytoprotective factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].
