Despite recent advances, the full phenotype of the DCs involved in these processes has been difficult to establish. Using LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)-based single-cell transcriptomics, we identify individual DCs capable of presenting antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tdLN. These represent a small fraction of all DCs present in the tdLN and display a distinctive activated phenotype that includes production of cytokine IL-27, required for efficient T cell priming and tumor rejection. Tumor progression results in loss of effective priming of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, downstream of transcriptional changes in DCs that are manifested already when they arrive at the tdLN. Collectively, our data reveal temporal shift in DC activation status over the course of the antitumor immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">When properly activated, T cells can exert powerful control over cancer, as evidenced by decades of work that culminated in checkpoint-blockade immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. As with other adaptive immune processes, the quality of the T cell response towards a tumor is heavily dependent on the identity and phenotype of the DCs that present tumor-derived antigens to T cells in the tumor draining lymph node (tdLN). DCs are divided into migratory DCs, capable of transporting antigens acquired in the tumor to the tdLN, and resident DCs, which have access only to antigen that arrives to LN through lymphatics or that is handed over to them by their migratory counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Both populations can be further subdivided along an orthogonal axis into conventional (c)DC1 and cDC2 subsets, based on their phenotype and ontogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Generally speaking, cDC1s have higher capacity to prime CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas migratory cDC2s are best at priming CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, although these distinctions are far from absolute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Both cDC1s and cDC2s have been implicated as drivers of the antitumor immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming by cDC2s is suppressed by regulatory T (Treg) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and Treg depletion unleashes a cDC2-driven CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to the tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, checkpoint inhibitors do not work efficiently in the absence of DCs, highlighting the role of antigen presentation as a major driver of the response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. More recent studies have identified a novel DC state termed “mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules” (mRegDCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. DCs in this state have enhanced capacity to take up antigens but reduced ability to prime antitumor T cell responses. mRegDC share many common genes with the novel “cDC3” subset described in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and further work is needed to clearly delineate the cDC3 and mRegDC states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Despite the central role they play in determining the quality of the antitumoral response, technical challenges in measuring cell–cell interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> have prevented a fine characterization of the individual DCs responsible T cell priming in this context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, limiting our understanding to the coarser level of whole DC populations. Resolution beyond the population level would be especially important for our understanding of cDC2 programs, given the greater heterogeneity of phenotypes and lineages among this subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To address such questions, we previously developed LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts), a proximity-based labeling method based on transfer between interacting cells of a labeled substrate detectable by flow-cytometry that allows us to identify and isolate DCs engaged in T cell priming <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. By combining LIPSTIC with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we performed interaction-based transcriptomic profiling of the DCs responsible for priming tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our data show that a minor population of DCs, characterized by a hyperactivated transcriptional program, accounted for most T cell priming in the tdLN. DCs with this phenotype were lost over time as tumors grew, which correlated with loss of effective T cell priming. Together, our data point towards the progressive suppression of DC activation as an additional strategy for tumor immune evasion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LIPSTIC identifies DCs capable of priming naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to tumor antigens</title><p id="P5">LIPSTIC relies on the <italic>S. aureus</italic> transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) to transfer an injectable biotinylated peptide substrate (biotin-LPETG) between pairs of cells interacting via the CD40L-CD40 pathway. SrtA, fused to the extracellular domain of CD40L expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, captures substrate injected <italic>in vivo</italic> and transfers it onto five N-terminal glycines engineered into the extracellular domain of CD40 (G<sub>5</sub>-CD40) on interacting DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To apply this system to a solid tumor model, we engineered the B16 melanoma cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to express the OVA<sub>323-339</sub> (OTII) peptide (B16<sup>OTII</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1A</xref>). We then inoculated G<sub>5</sub>-CD40-expressing mice (<italic>Cd40</italic><sup>G5/G5</sup>) subcutaneously with 10<sup>6</sup> B16<sup>OTII</sup> cells in the flank region to generate a response in the tumor-draining inguinal lymph node (tdLN). At 9 d.p.i., we adoptively transferred 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> CD40L-SrtA OTII T cells into tumor-bearing mice, carrying out LIPSTIC labeling of the tdLN by local injection of biotinylated LPETG substrate at 10-12 h after T cell transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), a point at which T cell interaction with DCs is exclusively cognate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This system allows transferred OTII T cells to serve as “reporters” that specifically identify and label the subset of DCs capable of priming naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at that time point.</p><p id="P6">This approach revealed that a minor population (approximately 5 to 10%) of DCs acquired the LIPSTIC label in the tdLN of mice bearing B16<sup>OTII</sup> tumors but not in controls inoculated with the parental B16 line (B16 WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In agreement with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, LIPSTIC labeling in the tdLN was detected exclusively on migratory (CD11c<sup>Int</sup>MHC-II<sup>Hi</sup>) but not resident (CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC-II<sup>int</sup>) DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1B</xref>). The specificity of LIPSTIC labeling was confirmed by injection of a blocking antibody to CD40L (clone MR1) 2 h prior to substrate injection, which fully abrogated labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Mixed bone marrow chimera experiments in which a fraction of DCs were deficient for MHC-II confirmed that LIPSTIC captures predominantly interactions driven by antigen presentation in this setting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1C</xref>). Thus, LIPSTIC labeling in the B16 system is antigen-specific and dependent on the CD40L-CD40 interaction. DCs of both XCR1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> (cDC1) and XCR1<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (cDC2) phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) were labeled by OTII T cells, at a ratio that corresponded roughly to the total cDC2/cDC1 ratio in each tdLN. This suggests that both subsets of DCs are equally capable of priming tumor antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, a notion supported by previous findings in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Because our B16<sup>OTII</sup> cell line also expresses GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1A</xref>), we were able to simultaneously probe DCs for interaction with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and for the extent to which they carry intact tumor-derived proteins. Although there was a statistically significant enrichment in biotin<sup>+</sup> cells among the GFP<sup>+</sup> DC population, GFP and LIPSTIC labeling were overall poorly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, the storage of intact tumor-derived antigen does not fully overlap with the ability to use this antigen to prime naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo, possibly due to the specific kinetics of antigen storage and presentation over time.</p><p id="P7">To ascertain that LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> DCs indeed carried the antigen necessary to prime antigen-specific T cells, we set up a miniaturized assay in which 150 tdLN-derived biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs were co-cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> with 750 CFSE-labeled OTII CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of exogenous antigen. This approach showed that biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs were exclusively capable of driving T cell proliferation above the background levels obtained with DCs derived from mice carrying parental B16 melanomas that lacked the OTII peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). An analogous experiment with OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> (OT-I) T cells (using a B16 line that we engineered to express a transmembrane version of the full OVA protein, B16<sup>mOVA</sup>) showed that, again, biotin<sup>+</sup> tdLN DCs were exclusively capable of driving T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). We conclude that LIPSTIC labeling faithfully identifies the DCs capable of presenting antigen to both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the tdLN, and that such DCs represent only a minor fraction of all DCs available at that site.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DCs capable of priming naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are in a distinct activated state</title><p id="P8">To understand what distinguishes DCs capable of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming in tdLNs beyond a population-level analysis, we transcriptionally profiled individual biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> migratory DCs obtained from tdLNs at 9 and 15 d.p.i. and control DCs from steady-state iLNs by plate-based single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). DCs fell into five transcriptional clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Spreadsheet S1</xref>), of which two expressed signatures associated with a cDC1 phenotype (Clusters 1 and 3) and three to a cDC2 phenotype (Clusters 0, 2, and 4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2A</xref>). Few differences were noted when comparing biotin<sup>−</sup> migratory DCs sorted from B16<sup>OTII</sup> tdLNs or total migratory DCs from steady-state iLNs. On the other hand, biotin<sup>+</sup> tdLN DCs, especially those with a cDC2 phenotype, were strongly enriched in Cluster 0, which consisted almost exclusively of LIPSTIC-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). Similar but less pronounced segregation of biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> phenotypes was observed within cDC1 Cluster 3 <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>)</bold>. In both cDC1 and cDC2 populations, LIPSTIC labeling correlated with expression of CD40 target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, as expected from DCs capable of priming a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response and given the pathway assayed by the LIPSTIC method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Differential gene expression comparing biotin<sup>+</sup> and biotin<sup>−</sup> tdLN DCs showed significant modulation of 269 genes (224 upregulated and 45 downregulated).

Changes included upregulation of genes encoding for classic markers of DC maturation (<italic>Cd80</italic>, <italic>Cd86</italic>, <italic>Cd40</italic>, <italic>Cd82</italic>) and of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation (<italic>Nfkbiz</italic>, <italic>Tnfaip3</italic> (A20))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, typical of an activated DC state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).

We then applied this signature to a previously published set of single-cell transcriptomes of tdLN myeloid cells obtained at 14 days post-inoculation with B16 melanoma, either in control conditions or after depletion of Treg cells using a <italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>DTR</sup> mouse allele. The LIPSTIC signature was expressed predominantly by one group of cells in this dataset (Cluster 6), corresponding to cDC2-phenotype DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Notably, although DCs from control tdLN were also present, the large majority of cells in this group (87.5%) originated from Treg-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Conversely, comparison of DCs from control and Treg-depleted settings showed upregulation of the LIPSTIC signature in cDC2s and to a lesser extent cDC1s, while DCs in Cluster 6 expressed this signature equally regardless of whether they originated in control or Treg-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). We conclude that DCs with a LIPSTIC-like phenotype can be detected in low numbers in the tdLNs of tumor-bearing mice in the absence of T cell transfer and increase in abundance upon depletion of Treg cells.</p><p id="P11">Together, our data indicate that DCs actively engaged in the priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells represent a transcriptionally unique population with activated DC features and increased expression of locomotion and migration genes, suggestive of enhanced ability to colocalize with T cells in LN regions conducive to T cell priming. Our analysis further suggests that acquisition of this activated phenotype by DCs is actively suppressed by the presence of Treg cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IL-27 produced by priming-competent DCs promotes an effective antitumoral response</title><p id="P12">Among the most highly upregulated genes in Cluster 0 at 9 d.p.i. were <italic>Ebi3</italic> and <italic>Il27</italic>, which encode for EBI3 and p28—the two subunits of the cytokine IL-27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S2C</xref>). IL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine that can take on pro- or anti-inflammatory roles depending on the setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and has been shown to either promote or suppress tumor growth in different experimental models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. To investigate the effects of IL-27 in our setting, we treated mice 9 days after subcutaneous inoculation of B16<sup>OTII</sup> cells with either a blocking antibody to p28 or an isotype control. One day later, we adoptively transferred OTII T cells into tumor bearing mice and followed the fate of these cells as they were primed within the tdLN and infiltrated the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the tdLN, blocking p28 reduced the ability of OTII T cells to produce CXCR3 and IFNγ, critical mediators of Th1 effector function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>). In agreement with the role of CXCR3 in promoting effector T cell trafficking to the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, p28 blockade reduced OTII T cell recruitment to the tumor, coinciding with a decrease in production of IFNγ by this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Parallel experiments using B16<sup>OVA</sup> showed that anti-p28 treatment also reduced IFNγ production by OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in both tdLN and tumor, although no difference in expression of CXCR3 or tumor infiltration was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S3B,C</xref>). To assess the significance to the anti-tumoral response of the loss of T cell effector function upon p28 blockade, we used our engineered B16<sup>mOVA</sup>, which showed delayed growth kinetics in comparison with B16<sup>OTII</sup> and was often completely rejected by the host (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1A</xref>). Treatment of mice inoculated with B16<sup>mOVA</sup> with p28 blocking antibody starting at 2 d.p.i.

Although baseline rejection of B16<sup>mOVA</sup> tumors was less pronounced in control <italic>Il27</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice lacking cre recombinase (possibly due to differences in the mouse housing environment at UCSD, where these experiments were performed), tumor growth was still significantly increased in mice lacking DC production of IL-27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>) compared to controls.

In line with tumor-mediated suppression, LIPSTIC labeling of migratory DCs decreased by 50% between 9 and 15 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This decrease was of equal magnitude in cDC1s and cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).

Thus, DCs lose capacity to prime naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells over a short period of time in two different implantable tumor models.</p><p id="P14">In addition to the reduction in the proportion of LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> DCs with time, analysis of our scRNA-seq data—which contained tdLN DCs obtained at both day 9 and day 15 post-tumor inoculation—showed that DCs from different time points occupied different positions in transcriptional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Specifically, there was a pronounced reduction in DCs expressing the activated “Cluster 0” program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) at the later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E and F</xref>). Thus, DCs capable of priming CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at late time points were not only less abundant, but also less activated than their early counterparts. To determine whether loss of Cluster 0 DCs at late time points had functional consequences for T cell priming, we adoptively transferred naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> OTII T cells into B16<sup>OTII</sup>-bearing recipient mice at 9 or 14 d.p.i.. Five days after cell transfer, we observed a greater extent of upregulation of classical exhaustion markers PD-1, Lag3, and TIGIT on T cells transferred at the late compared to the early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Transcriptional profiling of bulk OTII T cells primed early and late after tumor injection showed that T cells primed at the early time point were enriched in pathways associated with inflammatory responses and cytokine activity (<italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Cd83</italic>, <italic>Rel</italic>, <italic>Nfkbid</italic>, <italic>Il2</italic>, <italic>Lta</italic>) and expressed higher levels of genes directly suppressed by Foxp3 (such as <italic>Il2</italic> and <italic>Tnfsf11</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, although <italic>Foxp3</italic> itself was not detected in any sample in this dataset.

One day later, we immunized recipient mice with OVA in alum adjuvant in the base of the tail, a site that targets both the tdLN and the contralateral non-draining LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). We found no significant difference in the ability of tdLN DCs to prime CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (as read out by LIPSTIC labeling) compared to DCs in the contralateral LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus, the loss of DC ability to prime CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at late time points in tumor development is not driven by broad immunosuppression within the tdLN environment.</p><p id="P16">An alternative explanation for the loss of DC priming capacity with time is that suppression is intrinsic to the DCs arriving at the tdLN from the tumor. To verify this, we used an in-situ photoconversion protocol similar to one previously described in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> to directly measure the state of DCs arriving from the tumor to the tdLN at early and late time points.

Photoactivation of tumors under a 415 nm LED source at 9 and 14 d.p.i. led to accumulation of photoconverted migratory, but not resident, DCs in the tdLN as early as 16 h post-photoconversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S5A</xref>), allowing us to isolate DCs immediately after they arrived at the tdLN from the tumor. We performed scRNA-seq profiling of photoconverted DCs sorted from tdLN at 10 and 15 d.p.i. (i.e., 16 h after photoactivation at 9 and 14 d.p.i. respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F-H</xref>). DCs from both early and late time points were broadly distributed across three major transcriptional clusters, with noticeable enrichment of day 10 DCs in Cluster 2, composed primarily of cDC2-phenotype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S5B</xref>). There was a measurable reduction in the expression of both the LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> and the original “Cluster 0” signatures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Spreadsheet S4</xref>) in DCs obtained from the late time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Querying this dataset for differential expression of the entire 32,881 gene signature collection available in the MSigDB database (v.7.5.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> showed that both the LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> and the Cluster 0 gene signatures were better able to discern early and late photoconverted DCs than any other set in the database, including several signatures related to CD40 or NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Spreadsheet S6</xref>). Thus, a major distinction between DCs arriving in the tdLN from the tumor at early and late time points is the expression of genes in the LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> signature, indicative of their ability to prime a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. We conclude that the loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming capacity that arises at later stages of tumor development is not due to a generally immunosuppressive tdLN environment, but rather results from a qualitative shift in the activation status of the DCs that likely takes place before they migrate to the tdLN from the tumor site.</p><p id="P18">We conclude that tumor progression correlates with a loss of the ability of DCs to engage strong activation programs and present antigen to naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, likely due to changes in the state of migratory DCs prior to their arrival at the tdLN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">A challenge in studying the priming capabilities of DCs has been the heterogeneity in their phenotypes, even within canonical DC populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Whereas the literature is plentiful in associations between the broader populations of DCs (such as cDC1 and cDC2, or migratory and resident DCs) and the priming of specific types of T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, studies that characterize the individual DCs directly engaged in T cell priming are rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. LIPSTIC provides an easy and highly quantitative method to identify and profile engaged DCs at the individual cell level. As such, LIPSTIC provides degree of specificity to DC research analogous to that afforded to B and T cell studies by antigen tetramers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Our LIPSTIC data revealed that the fraction of all tdLN DCs that actively engage in priming CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to a subcutaneously implanted tumor is quite small, on the order of 5-10% of the DCs in the LN even at the early time point peak. These DCs are almost entirely of the migratory DC phenotype and are not enriched in cDC1 or cDC2 when compared to the entire LN DC population. In co-culture experiments, biotin<sup>+</sup> DCs were exclusively able to prime both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This indicates that the DCs that prime CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responses <italic>in vivo</italic> are included within the DC population labeled by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting substantial overlap between these populations. Thus, CD40L LIPSTIC is unlikely to be missing any DC populations capable of priming exclusively CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our findings contribute to a series of active discussions in the field regarding the numbers and population-level phenotypes of the DCs that prime the antitumoral T cell response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">A potential limitation of LIPSTIC is that it identifies only DCs that engage T cells through the CD40L-CD40 pathway. Most if not all conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are thought to express CD40L even in their naïve state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> and to upregulate its expression upon antigen-driven activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Conversely, most DCs express CD40, although its expression by resident DCs is generally lower than by DCs with migratory phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, because the CD40L-CD40 axis is critical for DC activation and licensing for cross-presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, CD40L LIPSTIC is likely to identify most or all DCs that are potent presenters of immunogenic tumor antigens. This notion is supported by our miniaturized DC culture assays, in which LIPSTIC-negative DCs were unable able to induce proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells above background levels, indicating that most antigen available to be presented <italic>in vivo</italic> is concentrated within the LIPTSIC<sup>+</sup> DC population.</p><p id="P22">Interaction-based transcriptional profiling of LIPSTIC-labeled cells showed that priming-capable DCs expressed a unique transcriptional profile that separated them from other DCs in the tdLN. Notably, total DCs from tdLN were indistinguishable transcriptionally from DCs obtained from a naïve iLN, implying that this population of DCs, or at least their prominent role in T cell priming, would not be identifiable without LIPSTIC. The ability to prime T cells was associated with upregulation of multiple genes important for DC activation and antigen presentation. These included classic DC maturation markers such as <italic>Cd80</italic>, <italic>Cd86</italic>, and <italic>Cd40</italic> itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, indicative of partial overlap with the canonical “mature DC” phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. However, LIPSTIC-labeled DCs also upregulated multiple genes and signatures associated with cell migration, adhesion, and T cell chemotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. Thus, the ability of DCs to access specific microanatomical compartments and to recruit T cells to these areas, previously shown to be functionally important for T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>, is in fact one of the defining characteristics of the DCs capable of engaging T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intersecting our transcriptional data with a much larger scRNA-seq data set of tdLN myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, revealed a cluster of DCs with strong expression of the LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> signature. A small fraction of this cluster represented DCs found in the tdLN under control non-manipulated conditions— indicating that the LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> transcriptional state is not a product of our specific setup (e.g., of the adoptive transfer of a relatively large number of tumor antigen-specific T cells). More importantly, however, the large majority of cells in this cluster consisted of DCs that appeared upon ablation of Treg cells using a DTR transgene. These findings suggest that one of the effects of Treg cells, possibly potentiated in the tumor microenvironment, is to prevent DCs from acquiring a LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup>-like state. Of note, the cytokine IL-27 was among the most upregulated gene products in LIPSTIC<sup>+</sup> DCs. IL-27 is an especially pleiotropic cytokine, which has been shown to prime both tolerogenic and immunogenic T cell responses under different conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>. In our settings, IL-27 produced by DCs was essential for priming IFNγ production by tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, recruitment of effector T cells to the tumor site, and control of tumor growth. This result agrees with previous reports in the literature and disagrees with others under similar settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. The reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear and merit further investigation.</p><p id="P23">We observed a pronounced decrease in LIPSTIC labeling of DCs over a short period of time from 10 to 15 days post-tumor inoculation, which correlated with an almost complete loss of DCs with the activated “Cluster 0” signature. Tumor growth was thus associated with an abrupt loss of DC activation and priming capacity, even as the load of tumor-derived antigen increased. The local environment of the tdLN itself appears not to be responsible for loss of DC fitness, since immunization of tumor-draining and non-draining LN with a non-tumoral antigen led to equal LIPSTIC labeling at both sites. On the other hand, <italic>in vivo</italic> photoconversion experiments showed that DCs arriving from the tumor to the tdLN at late time points strongly downregulated gene signatures associated with LIPSTIC labeling, to the extent that changes in expression of LIPSTIC-related gene signatures appear to be the primary distinction between DCs that arrive at the tdLN at early vs. late time points. Together, these observations indicate that the state in which DCs arrive at the tdLN over time changes, implicating the tumor microenvironment—possibly including innate maturation stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup> or signals delivered by help from tumor-infiltrating effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and/or suppressed by Treg cells—in setting the maturation state and priming capability of tdLN DCs.</p><p id="P24">In conclusion, LIPSTIC allowed us, for the first time, to identify the individual DCs capable of priming CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the course of tumor development and to define transcriptional programs associated with this capability and how they change over time.

Bulk RNA sequencing was performed as for scRNA-seq except that 700 cells were sorted per well.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Transcriptomic analysis</title><p id="P39">scRNA-Seq libraries were processed using RSEM for sequencing read quantification and STAR for the transcriptome alignment. For our single-cell studies, quantification matrices were loaded into the R environment and processed using the Seurat package pipelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. Briefly, cells containing more than 10% of their reads mapped to mitochondrial DNA were filtered out. In addition, we also removed single-cell contaminants that expressed known markers of B-cells, T-cells, and macrophages. In total, 562 cells were selected for downstream analysis for our LIPSTIC experiment and 299 cells for our photoactivation experiment. For both experiments, cells were log normalized, and the top 2,000 variable genes were selected for data scaling and PCA construction. During data scaling, the library size and the mitochondrial percent were regressed-out to remove unwanted variation sources. After PCA construction, the JackStraw algorithm available in Seurat was used to select the most significant principal components. Finally, cells were clustered and visualized in t-SNE space. For signature analysis, the AddModuleScore function was used to determine the average expression of a gene list compared to a background control. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed in the R environment using the fgsea package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup> to determine pathway enrichment. Signature sets obtained from MSigDB were used as input with a pre-ranked list based on log2 fold change. Signatures were considered enriched if the adjusted p-value had a value of at least 0.05. To determine commonly activated genes in LIPSTIC positive cDC1 and cDC2 cells, we used a LIPSTIC signature as a pathway and the pre-ranked comparison between cDC1 (positive x negative) and cDC2 (positive x negative). We then compared the two LIPSTIC positive leading edges for matching and exclusive genes. For external data analysis, data was downloaded from the GEO database, accession code: GSE125680<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To apply our LIPSTIC signature, we used the AddModuleScore function available with the Seurat package. We used the top 20 genes enriched in biotin positive DCs compared to biotin negative DCs, or the top 20 genes enriched in Cluster 0, compared to the remainder of the cells.</p><p id="P40">Bulk RNA-Seq data was aligned and quantified using STAR. The count matrix was used within the R environment and processed using the DESeq2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup>. Genes from samples expressing less than 10 reads were pre-filtered. Gene expression among samples was normalized by applying a negative binomial distribution model. Differential gene expression was determined by the Wald test, genes with adjusted FDR &lt;0.1 were considered for downstream analysis, and log2 fold changes were shrunk using the ashr algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref></sup>. Finally, GSEA was performed in the pre-ranked mode using the fgsea package as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P41">All statistical analyses was performed using data from at least three biological replicates, with the exact number of replicates stated in each figure legend. Unless stated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism v.8 software. Unpaired Student’s t test was used for most pairwise comparisons, except instances indicated in figure legends where paired Student t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. For experiments involving more than two groups of animals one-way ANOVA was used with Tukey’s test comparing the means of every treatment to the means of every other treatment. Differences with p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Spreadsheet 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Spreadsheet_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplemental Figures and Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS156306-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_and_Table.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P42">We thank A.
