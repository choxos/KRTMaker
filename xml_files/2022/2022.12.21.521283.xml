However, chronic unresolved inflammation can become a serious health problem, as exemplified in the joints during Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Why does inflammation persist in RA? The answer could lie with synovial fibroblasts, non-haemopoietic cells that can adopt a pathogenic phenotype that fuels disease progression for years. Critically, targeting local fibroblasts could stop joint inflammation without suppressing systemic immunity. Nevertheless, basic research findings have not been translated to new drugs, perhaps because non-physiological data can be inadvertently generated in 2D cultures. Thus, developing better in vitro platforms is an urgent need in biomedical research. In this work, we sought to understand how distinct 3D environments affect fibroblast-mediated inflammation. Arthritic synovial fibroblasts were expanded and cultured in 2D, 3D rigid scaffolds and engineered hydrogels. The results reveal that SFs are plastic and adopt inflammatory or remission-like phenotypes in response to their surroundings. This work identifies new directions to develop better models for drug testing, and even signposts candidate mechanisms by which to rewire destructive SFs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>3D culture</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>hydrogels</kwd><kwd>arthritis</kwd><kwd>synovial fibroblast</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, were initially described simply as tissue supportive cells whose main function was to produce the matrix in which other cells were embedded. This was particularly true for early immunologists, captivated by the protective and pathogenic roles of the most recognizable immune effector cells. Today we see a different landscape, where fibroblasts are moving to the centre stage in immunology because in addition to their well-established role of providing physical support, fibroblasts define the nature and magnitude of local immune responses. A clear example is the synovial fibroblast (SF), a specialized population found only in the synovium, the tissue lining the inside of the capsule wrapping articular joints such as the shoulder, wrist, knee or ankle. SFs provide nutritional support and synthesise lubricating molecules like hyaluronic acid and lubricin, but they can also secrete inflammatory mediators and control bone remodelling. When this process is dysregulated, SFs can become active disease drivers, as in the joints of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. During RA, SFs become hyperproliferative, increase production of matrix-degrading enzymes and promote recruitment and survival of immune system cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) In turn, immune system cells secrete more inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-17 or TNF, consolidating SF-mediated production of inflammatory factors. This results in further recruitment of immune cells and generation of self-sustained inflammatory and bone-destruction loops, a hallmark of chronic inflammation in RA.</p><p id="P3">Modulation of SFs responses would offer a clinical benefit to RA patients, as it would directly target the core disease tissue to neutralize local autoimmune networks whilst avoiding the adverse effects of current immunosuppressive drugs. However, despite intensive research in the field no drug has been approved to target SFs yet. This might reflect that our understanding of SF-dependent inflammation is based not only on clinical or in vivo studies, but also on cells expanded in vitro on non-physiological two-dimensional (2D) substrates. 2D systems are convenient, allow rapid expansion of biological material and have made important scientific contributions. Nonetheless, their limitations are increasingly acknowledged in biomedical research. Tissue architecture and matrix-mediated signalling are lost, and cells adapt their gene expression in response to the artificial flat surroundings. In response to this, 3D culture models have been engineered to mimic more physiological cellular and/or tissue conditions. Examples are scaffold-free derived matrices, such as collagen gelation or spheroid cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Alternatively, scaffold-based 3D techniques include protein-based structures, such as the extensively used Matrigel<sup>®</sup>, but also natural and synthetic hydrogels and hard polymer scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In these systems, cells are seeded on an acellular matrix, polymeric materials or dispersed in a liquid matrix followed by polymerization. More specific tissue-oriented approaches are 3D bioprinting designs and organ-on-chips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this context, some studies have addressed the development of 3D cultures to study synovial pathophysiology. These are considerably more specialized because of the distinct anatomical characteristics of the synovium, and because SFs in the arthritic joint tissue contain unique features that are not shared by fibroblasts found in other locations, such as hypoxia, substantial inflammatory cell infiltration and distinct matrix remodeling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) In fact, although expanded SFs preserve epigenetic modifications associated to a pathogenesis,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) prolonged culture of SFs on 2D surfaces results in a gradual loss of disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Three-dimensionality in the synovium governs SFs-matrix-dependent signaling, determining the changes in cellular shape and adhesion that contribute to the formation of the pannus, the abnormally thickened synovial tissue that migrates across the articular cartilage and bone causing tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Ex vivo synovial explants have been used as a surrogate of tissue for in vitro studies, although tissue availability from early disease stages is limited and other samples from surgery are too damaged and have been exposed to drugs for years, disturbing basic immune mechanisms. Initial 3D cultures for SFs were conducted 25 years ago in fibrin gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), but it is only recently that more diverse methods have been developed. Matrigel-based systems, often described as micromasses, are the most common approach. Matrigel provides a more physiological platform, allowing in vitro differentiation of the lining synovial membrane and SF responses to cytokines such as TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). On the other hand, limitations in Matrigel cultures are known, like batch-to-batch variability and undefined composition. Attempts have been made to develop other platforms, either alone or in combination with other synovial cells. These include microfluidic chips incorporating fibrin gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), 3D printed collagen/alginate gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) or collagen gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In most cases, the choice of the 3D culture and material is determined by the specific biological process to be tested in vitro, such as migration, invasiveness, leukocyte migration or modulation of angiogenesis. But the effect of the culture system on the activation of cellular pathways and SF-dependent inflammation is normally overlooked. Furthermore, given the high degree of variability in the methods found in the literature and differences in composition in Matrigel lots, it is not possible to compare independent results. Thus, how differential culture conditions impact on SF cell biology, outside of the primary experimental readout is often unknown, despite the potential for these effects to directly affect the experimental results generated.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we use a murine model of arthritis to investigate the influence of ex vivo culture conditions on activated SFs. To provide a broader and integrative perspective, we show a direct comparison between freshly isolated SFs from the synovium, both from healthy and inflamed joints, and we compared the activated phenotype with cells expanded in conventional 2D cultures and in two unrelated 3D systems: i) fibronectin-(FN)-coated polystyrene scaffolds and ii) fibronectin-(FN)-based 3D hydrogels. Scaffolds were commercially available from Alvetex<sup>®</sup>, and hydrogels were produced in-house, functionalizing the FN protein with PEG-maleimide (PEGylation) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Our results provide a systematic comparison of the transcriptomic signature in healthy and inflammatory SFs expanded in 2D culture and also following transfer to two distinct 3D systems, allowing a reliable understanding of the effect of the culture microenvironment on fibroblast responses. Whilst culture on 2D resulted in a loss of functional phenotype, we discovered that on scaffolds, perhaps mimicking the joint/bone environment, the cells partially recovered their pathogenic phenotype indicating that this may provide a more suitable platform for candidate drug screening. Intriguingly, we found their culture in hydrogels to induce a non-inflammatory or “remission-like” phenotype that may offer therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of healthy and activated SFs in 2D culture</title><p id="P6">We used the murine model of Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA), a well-defined and reproducible setup to mimic the SF activation observed in human RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We expanded SFs from both healthy and CIA synovium until passage 3-4, a time point until which we have previously shown CIA SFs to maintain epigenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The cells expressed the stromal marker vimentin and showed the expected flattened morphology, where cell adhesions are restricted to x-y plane, presenting an apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Confirming their imprinted pro-inflammatory phenotype, cultured CIA SFs showed elevated IL-6 and Ccl2 production compared with cells expanded from healthy animals and this pathogenic signature was further enhanced in response to IL-17 stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). SFs are a heterogeneous population, where distinct subsets are found in specific anatomical areas, lining and sublining membrane, and can be identified by CD90<sup>-</sup>VCAM<sup>+</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM<sup>-</sup> phenotypes respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) with non-overlapping functions in the synovium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). In our model, SFs directly isolated from the joint (not cultured) were mostly sublining CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM1<sup>-</sup> (~70%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), representative of the major population also described in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). A smaller subset (~5%) was identified as VCAM-1<sup>+</sup>, an adhesion molecule enriched in lining areas and up-regulated in tissue-destructive SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). On the other hand, when SFs were expanded in 2D, they presented a non-physiological phenotype dominated by CD90 and VCAM co-expression (~60-70%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which represents only a marginal population in vivo and hence such cultured SFs reflect the artefactual enrichment/rewiring of physiologically-relevant functional phenotypes. Yet, both non-cultured and cultured CIA cells increased VCAM1 expression compared to their naïve counterparts, suggesting some preservation of cell activation reflective of that occurring in the arthritic joint. As the artificial CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM1<sup>+</sup> phenotype could be a consequence of the lack of supportive matrix, we coated culture plates with fibronectin (FN) to assess the potential impact of cell-matrix interactions on such SF-mediated inflammatory responses. We selected FN as a model because it accumulates in areas of SF proliferation in RA, guiding SFs to the pannus and up-regulating MMPs through α5β1 and αvβ3 integrin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Confirming the association between FN-enriched areas and local inflammation, the presence of FN increased IL-6 and MMP3 expression, an effect that was enhanced in CIA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>2D culture induces fundamental changes in SFs transcriptome</title><p id="P7">Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> showed that even when SFs expanded in culture preserve some of the inflammatory characteristics of in vivo activated cells, they also undergo extensive phenotypic changes. This was however expected, but it confirmed the influence of cell culture on SFs. Therefore, we decided to conduct a deeper analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). First, we utilized our RNA-Seq dataset from SFs directly purified from mouse synovium [GEO Series accession number GSE162306 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) as a physiological reference of SF activation in arthritis. In this dataset, naïve and arthritic SFs were sorted by FACs (Podoplanin<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>) and RNA was immediately purified for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The distinction between naïve and CIA cells was quantified by PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Here, 298 genes were up-regulated and 88 genes were down-regulated in arthritic SFs relative to naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). To generate a detailed molecular and biological reference, we conducted a new functional enrichment analysis on up-regulated genes in CIA SFs integrating KEGG pathways, WiKiPathways and CORUM databases using the bioinformatic tool ClueGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). This confirmed SF activation, dominated by enriched functional nodes containing cytokine signalling (IL-17 and TNF), JAK-STAT signalling and cell cycle activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), in line with the expected arthritic phenotype. To further illustrate this, we designed four gene lists to provide a tailored analysis of mechanisms of known importance for SF-mediated immunopathology which will be relevant for comparison with ex vivo 2D and 3D cultures: i) proliferation, ii) matrix remodeling, iii) secretion of inflammatory mediators and iv) migratory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected, all selected genes were up-regulated in activated CIA SFs.</p><p id="P8">Next, we assessed the transcriptomic signature of arthritic SFs following ex vivo expansion in 2D. We digested mouse synovium as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, but cells were expanded in conventional polystyrene flasks (3-4 passages) prior to culturing them for 7 days on FN-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). RNA was then extracted for RNA-Seq analysis. Like in the non-cultured SFs, PCA still separated both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), but the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes in CIA cultured SFs was considerably reduced (112 up-regulated, 12 down-regulated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Enrichment analysis showed the loss of inflammatory signature, as well as the cell cycle and proliferation markers from non-cultured cells. Only ECM-receptor interaction, Wnt signalling and adipogenesis were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), although some inflammatory markers like Mmp3, Mmp9, Cxcl13 or Ccl11, and some migration genes, Postn, Cdh11, were still up-regulated, albeit statistical significance was not reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>), perhaps sustaining the core for some ‘inflammatory memory’. Overall, cells in 2D lost the inflammatory phenotype when compared with “in vivo” cells, despite the presence of FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figures 2D-E vs 2I-J</xref>). Regarding cell migration, even when some genes were differentially expressed in CIA cells, some others showed an opposite regulation compared to the in vivo reference, like Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (Cthrc1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,J</xref>), a protein enhancing SF migration in arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cultured SFs recover their pro-inflammatory phenotype in 3D scaffolds</title><p id="P9">Our data indicated that the inflammatory phenotype of SFs is largely absent or changed upon 2D culture, along with their cell morphology and differentiation. Because morphology can influence function, signaling and cytokine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), we subsequently cultured the expanded SFs in 3D environments in an aim to provide a more physiological environment. We first used commercially available Alvetex<sup>®</sup> scaffolds made of porous cross-linked polystyrene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). These are engineered to a thickness of 200 μm with pores around 36-40 μm, with a ‘sponge-like’ appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Like in 2D cultures, we coated the scaffold with full-length FN. Scaffolds supported SFs attachment, cell viability and proliferation, as shown by hematoxylin/eosin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). SF attachment and distribution within the scaffolds were impacted by interaction with FN, as cells cultured in the presence or absence of FN showed a distinct migratory pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). SFs expressed the stromal marker vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), and reconstruction of Z-stacked confocal images stained for phalloidin revealed the SFs to display 3D morphology and rounder more physiological shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we conducted RNA-Seq studies as before to investigate how the new 3D culture conditions impacted on the transcriptome of arthritic SFs. We used the same cells expanded in 2D but transferred them to scaffolds for 7 days prior to RNA isolation and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). PCA confirmed again the stable nature of distinct naïve and arthritic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to the low numbers of DE genes observed in 2D conditions, SFs switched to scaffolds showed 548 up-regulated genes and 203 downregulated genes in arthritis relative to naïve SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). Similar pathway analysis showed that many inflammatory pathways were significantly enriched, contained in an organized network sustained by “IL-17 signaling” and “Cytokines and Inflammatory response’ terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), networks reminiscent of those results observed with arthritic SFs purified from joints prior to any cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Likewise, networks directly involved in cell cycle were detected, in line with the hyperproliferative status of activated SFs in arthritis. Targeted analysis confirmed the recovery of a proliferative and inflammatory signature in arthritic SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas matrix remodeling and migration pathways were only partially retrieved and the migration-related Cthrc1, ST3Gal4 and Loxl2 genes displayed a non-physiological regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Collectively these data indicate that the inflammatory phenotype lost in 2D can be at least partially recovered when SFs are transferred to 3D FN-coated scaffolds.</p><p id="P11">To corroborate these results scaffold at the protein level, we evaluated the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 by immunofluorescence. CIA SFs in scaffolds showed an elevated proportion of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells relative to healthy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), confirming the reappearance of the hyperproliferative phenotype of arthritic SFs. Regarding inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and MMP3 secretion in arthritic SFs was up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, we evaluated CD90 and VCAM-1 expression by immunofluorescence to define differentiation of SFs into functional subsets. Interestingly, scaffold cultures reduced the percentages of 2D-associated CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> co-expression. Only ~20% in naïve and 40% in CIA cells were found to be double positive for these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>), compared with 65% and 74% of cells in 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and 2% and 6% in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, scaffolds ‘reversed’ 2D SFs artefactual differentiation towards a more physiological phenotype in terms of proliferation, production of inflammatory factors and subset differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FN-based hydrogels drive arthritic SFs towards a non-inflammatory phenotype</title><p id="P12">ECM-derived matrices are relatively common in rheumatology research to study SF migration. Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) obtained from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma dominates the current literature, but it may not offer an ideal system to study the role of matrix in inflammation because of its undefined composition and batch variability. Furthermore, the effect of a gel-based structure on SF activation is usually overlooked. To address this, we used engineered hydrogels containing full-length FN as the only matrix component to study its influence on SF-mediated inflammation within a gel structure. Full-length FN was functionalised with poly(ethylelene) glycol (PEG)-maleimide (PEGMAL), allowing covalently crosslinking within a synthetic network to create a 3D FNPEG gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We first investigated whether hydrogels supported SF viability. SFs were expanded in 2D until passages 3-4, after which they were incorporated into hydrogels. Expression of the stromal marker vimentin was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Intriguingly, cells showed an unexpected tropism and relocated towards the hydrogel edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed a survival rate of 70-80% after 14 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Then, we conducted RNA-Seq studies, in line with the experiments done for 2D and scaffolds. To extract RNA, hydrogels needed to be degraded, so a protease-degradable VPM peptide (GCRDVPMSMRGGDRCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) was incorporated in the network. Such chemical modification does not affect the mechanical or structural properties of FNPEG hydrogels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Cells expanded in 2D were integrated in hydrogels and RNA was isolated at day 3 of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) because longer time points resulted in gel degradation and consequent cell loss, probably because of their constitutive secretion of MMPs. PCA confirmed the distinct profile of naïve and arthritic SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). DE genes in arthritic SFs relative to naïve were identified, showing 112 genes upregulated and 67 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 4</xref>), numbers lower than those seen with scaffolds or non-cultured cells and more akin to those observed in 2D. Surprisingly, not only the number of up-regulated genes was low in arthritic SFs, but the pathways associated with such gene expression were not reflective of inflammatory cells either. Rather, pathway enrichment revealed a significant regulation of ECM-receptor interaction and tissue remodelling genes and pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In fact, targeted analysis of arthritogenic pathways indicated that arthritic SFs in hydrogels decreased expression of such proliferation and inflammatory markers and showed an opposite pattern of migratory gene expression compared with the original arthritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, MMPs were still up-regulated, supporting the induction of matrix and tissue remodeling pathways in hydrogels.</p><p id="P14">To validate the biological effect observed in hydrogel culture, we collected culture supernatants to analyze MMP3, IL-6 and Ccl2 expression using degradable hydrogels, as in the RNA-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). MMP3 expression was significantly higher in arthritic SFs, confirming RNA-Seq data. IL-6 and Ccl2 were also higher in CIA SFs, differing from the transcriptomic results. This could be explained by the higher expression of MMPs in arthritic SFs, meaning that arthritic SFs could degrade the gel quicker, which may allow release of cytokines to the media. By contrast, naïve SFs would not degrade the gel because of the low MMP expression, resulting in no release of cytokine outside the gel boundaries. This hypothesis is supported by experiments done in hydrogels lacking VPM peptide, and therefore non-degradable and resistant to MMP degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). In such non-degradable gels, cytokine levels in supernatants were lower than in degradable gels, and arthritic SFs showed similar, or even lower expression of inflammatory cytokines. This reflects a reduction of the inflammatory capacity of arthritic SFs when switched to hydrogels, in agreement with our transcriptomic results. Next, we evaluated cell distribution within the gels. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI, hydrogels were fully scanned and reconstructed in 3D images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). We measured the distance of single cells to the image border, as a surrogate value for cell migration within the gel. No difference was observed between naïve and CIA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that arthritic SFs do not have a distinct migration or adhesion signature in hydrogels and suggesting again a loss of pathogenic pathways associated with chronic disease. Finally, we stained for CD90 and VCAM1 to evaluate subset specialization. Following scanning of the full gel, we did not find a clear CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>) as seen in 2D, although we were not able to quantify double positive cells due to technical limitations of the imaging software. However, in naïve cells the number of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly higher than those expressing VCAM1, suggesting the absence of the dominant CD90<sup>+</sup>VCAM1<sup>+</sup> phenotype observed in 2D.</p><p id="P15">Our results showed that whilst scaffolds represent a valuable system to better maintain the SF inflammatory phenotype in vitro, hydrogels redirect pathogenic fibroblasts towards a tissue remodeling and non-inflammatory phenotype, conclusions corroborated in a multisystem comparison using Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Identification of DE genes shared among systems corroborated the similarities between in vivo SF activation and scaffold cultures, with hydrogels being the most distinct group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). This was supported by an integrative analysis of Canonical Pathways, KEGG pathways and WiKi pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), showing hydrogels being the only system that did not show enriched IL-17-mediated pathways, a hallmark of inflammatory arthritis. This highlights the rewiring effect of 3D hydrogels on SF, a process that increased transcriptional activity of TWIST2 and decreased Jun and YBX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SF responses to IL-1β stimulation in 2D and 3D in vitro systems</title><p id="P16">To evaluate how stable the hydrogel-dependent rewiring of SFs was, we evaluated whether healthy cells responded to exogenous inflammatory stimulation using IL-1β. This induced activation in 2D, scaffolds and hydrogels systems, up-regulating inflammatory cytokines and chemokines Csf3, IL-6, or Ccl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, although SFs cultured in hydrogels still responded to IL-1β stimulation, the response was significantly less strong than in SFs from the other platforms. For example, fold increase for Csf3 was 273 in 2D, 3816 in scaffolds and only 15 in hydrogels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The ability to prevent inflammation of hydrogels was further evidenced by their reduced number of up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>) and enriched pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>) upon IL-1β stimulation. Mechanistically, IL-1β failed to induce expression of genes regulated by the transcription factors HIF1A, ESR1, STAT6 and SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>) in hydrogels, but not in 2D and scaffolds, reflecting the less inflammatory environment found in hydrogels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our results show a critical loss of the pathophysiological phenotype of inflammatory SFs expanded in 2D. This results were expected and confirm previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). However, we demonstrate that the loss of inflammatory phenotype is not permanent and can be retrieved when the right environmental conditions are provided. Relocation of 2D SFs into scaffolds restored a significant number of pathogenic pathways, whilst perhaps surprisingly, FNPEG hydrogels pushed arthritic cells towards a non-inflammatory and remodeling phenotype. This reveals that SFs retain a high degree of plasticity such that their phenotype is ultimately determined by ongoing signals coming from the microenvironment. Because such signals can be recapitulated by biomaterials, our findings can impact in two major areas of research, i) development of more physiological 3D culture methods to study SF biology and ii) discovery of novel approaches to modulate fibroblast-mediated inflammation in chronic disease.</p><p id="P18">Regarding culture methods for SFs, our findings in rigid scaffolds may lead to more physiological and affordable systems able to support pathophysiological matrix-dependent signaling and interactions. Major advances in drug discovery for RA have been made over the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Yet, as the therapies available all target immune system cells and inflammation, they are subject to immunosuppressive side-effects that would be avoided with drugs targeting the fibroblast compartment. However, despite increasing knowledge of the role that SFs play in the perpetuation of disease, this information has not been successfully translated from the pre-clinical to clinical stage. One reason for this could be that in vitro assays for drug screening do not accurately recapitulate the synovial 3D space and associated signaling, preventing identification of relevant targets. Consistent with this, our data show that the culture conditions determine the transcriptomic and functional phenotype of SFs. The hyperproliferative and inflammatory signature of arthritic SFs is lost in 2D expanded SFs, even when epigenetic changes alter cell function and apparently stably imprint SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Such epigenetic regulation includes DNA hypomethylation and microRNA expression. The methylation pattern in RA SFs is stable over many cell passages in 2D, but these cultured cells still show a non-physiological phenotype. Interestingly, dysregulated epigenetic pathways in arthritic SFs are related to cell cycle, cell adhesion, immune function, and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Such pathways define a phenotype that is lost in 2D but recovered in FN-coated 3D scaffolds, suggesting that cell morphology and environmental cues and signaling are also required to establish and maintain the epigenetically imprinted inflammatory program. This could also explain why RA affect only some joints, and why DNA methylation and transcriptomic SF patterns differ between joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Thus, it is essential to establish routine culture conditions to mimic the joint microenvironment in vitro, identifying the right structure and materials. This is especially important for samples collected at early disease stages, where the availability of biological tissue is very low and the accuracy in the diagnosis, such as disease phenotype, can be critical to start efficient treatment and to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Culture of SFs from individual patients in 3D scaffolds would allow better patient stratification and drug screening, as it could preserve the SF-dependent pathophysiology during in vitro diagnostic methods. Our study supports this hypothesis, but follow-up studies in the human context are required to validate this. Ultimately, an in vitro synovium model should consider inclusion of other cell types known to interact with SFs to create the synovial environment. Mondadori et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) designed a microfluidic chamber to model multi-cellular interactions, including synovial and cartilage compartments to mimic SF-chondrocyte-monocyte interactions. Similarly, Peck et al addressed the same problem, using a tri-culture platform and cell lines to model SFs and macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) whilst 3D systems to co-culture SFs and endothelial cells have been used to study cell migration and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The results from these studies will be important towards the final aim of generating a synovium-on-a-chip system, although a comparative analysis of the results found in the literature may not be possible given the technical diversity employed. Currently, most research in 3D SF culture have focused on hydrogels of various nature, Matrigel being the most common choice, but also employing fibrin, collagen or alginate hydrogels. 3D hydrogels are generally used to study specific cellular responses, such as cell migration, but the effect of the culture system on global SF responses is often neglected. Our results reveal that hydrogels not only failed to restore the hyperproliferative and inflammatory signature in arthritic SFs, but they rewired the already activated cells towards an altered phenotype, closer to a remission-like phenotype and distant from the original inflammatory phenotype in vivo. Matrigel has been shown to enhance expression of MMPs in RA SFs without affecting IL-6, and to allocate cells at the edge of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), in agreement with our results in FN hydrogels. This could indicate that mechanical properties found in gel-like structure could facilitate the formation of distinct anatomical structures. Such structures have elegantly revealed novel physiological roles for Integrin α9 and Cadherin-11(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), but deeper analysis are needed to fully understand how close gel systems are to synovial tissues. In this work, arthritic SFs cultured on hydrogels showed significantly up-regulated pathways involved in osteogenesis, tissue remodeling and decreased cytokine/chemokine secretion. This difference with the rigid 3D scaffolds highlights the relevance of the culture method in SF-dependent responses. This should be considered in the design of 3D systems to mimic the arthritic synovium, but it also offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention, since this demonstrates that inflammatory SFs can be reprogramed. Several factors could explain the differences observed in our models. Although in our study we always started with FN-based environments, distinct matrisomes can be formed. Our RNA-Seq data showed that 2D cells simply lose most of the inflammatory factors, but arthritic SFs in hydrogels actively up-regulate genes not seen in 2D, nor in rigid scaffolds: for example, collagen fibrils biosynthesis and crosslinking (collagen alpha chains Col1, Col3, Col4, Col6, Col12, <italic>P4ha</italic>, <italic>Adamst2</italic>) and elastic fibre formation (Combining fibronectin, fibulins and microfibrillar-associated proteins) pathways. This could establish pro- or anti-inflammatory fibroblast-matrix crosstalk, events that contribute to RA progression at early disease stages via TLR4 signaling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) Moreover, the properties of materials for tissue culture influence FN conformation and integrin binding(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>) and functional growth factor presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), which can influence cellular processes like cell migration, integrin activation and subsequent inflammatory responses. Ultimately, the culture system could affect their cell subset specialization, such as lining and sublining fibroblast, that drive tissue damage and inflammation respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This hypothesis could open new bioengineering solutions, since we could combine materials to reproduce different synovial anatomical locations in vitro.</p><p id="P20">Nevertheless, the factors driving FN-dependent rewiring are still unclear and require further investigation. Differences in the stiffness of scaffolds and hydrogels suggest that this could be an important aspect to consider, and it is one limitation in our study. In fact, the arthritic joint is known to increase the stiffness of the synovium above normal values(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Differential mechanical forces in the joint could therefore be the required signal for SFs to start inflammatory circuits, something that could involve interactions with FN and other matrix components. Additionally, our study is restricted to fibronectin-based systems, which we used as a model of SFs enriched areas, but the synovial matrix is formed by many other components that are likely to play a role in SF-biology and disease progression. This should be considered in future studies to understand basic fibroblast pathology and to develop relevant in vitro models. Thus, recapitulation of homeostatic and inflammatory environments should be fully understood in order to develop novel in vitro systems and even therapeutic opportunities, not only in RA, but in other chronic inflammatory conditions where fibroblasts-matrix interactions play a role in disease progression. Our results highlight the importance of the culture system in the outcome of in vitro experiments, paving the way for a more rational use of these tools in rheumatology research, as well as new clinical approaches to reconfigure arthritic SFs towards a resolving anti-inflammatory phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice and Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) model</title><p id="P21">Male DBA/1 mice were purchased at 8 weeks of age (Envigo; Bicester, UK) and then housed and maintained at the Central Research Facility in the University of Glasgow.
