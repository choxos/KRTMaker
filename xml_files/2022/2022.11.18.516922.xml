Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) models and in human AD brain and that the onset of this state is emphasized in females. <italic>Cst7</italic> (encoding protein Cystatin F) is among the most highly upregulated genes in these microglia. However, despite such striking and robust upregulation, the sex-specific function of <italic>Cst7</italic> in neurodegenerative disease is not understood. Here, we crossed <italic>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mouse to test the role of <italic>Cst7</italic> in a model of amyloid-driven AD. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Cst7</italic> plays a sexually dimorphic role regulating microglia in this model. In females, <italic>Cst7</italic>-deficient microglia had greater endolysosomal gene expression, lysosomal burden, and amyloid beta (Aβ) burden <italic>in vivo</italic> and were more phagocytic <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, in males, <italic>Cst7</italic>-deficient microglia were less inflammatory and had a reduction in lysosomal burden but had no change in Aβ burden. This study has important implications for AD research, confirming the functional role of a gene which is commonly upregulated in disease models, but also raising crucial questions on sexual dimorphism in neurodegenerative disease and the interplay between endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways in AD pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterised pathologically by buildup of protein aggregates such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau. AD is also characterised by reactive glial cells, including the emergence of altered microglia. Microglia are the predominant immune cells of the brain parenchyma and play numerous roles in development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Colonna and Butovsky, 2017</xref>). In recent years, microglia have become heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, in part due to accumulating genetic and epigenetic evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to altered risk for late-onset AD (LOAD) are enriched in microglial-expressed genes associated with endolysosomal function and lipid handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Podleśny-Drabiniok, Marcora and Goate, 2020</xref>). This implies that microglia may play a causal role in the disease and supports the theory that microglia may be targeted to treat AD. In addition to genetics, sex is a major risk factor for AD, with women up to twice as likely to be diagnosed than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Podcasy and Epperson, 2016</xref>). This sex bias is not entirely due to increased longevity in females, as increased risk remains after adjusting for lifespan, and may be due to interaction effects between sex/gender and genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gamache, Yun and Chiba-Falek, 2020</xref>). The mechanisms for this, and possible interplay between microglia and sex are poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Recently, an altered state of microglia has been identified in AD models that arises dependent on AD risk gene <italic>TREM2</italic>. These cells, termed disease-associated microglia (DAM)/ microglial neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD)/activated response microglia (ARM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Keren-Shaul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Krasemann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) are characterised by downregulation of microglial ‘homeostatic’ genes <italic>Tmem119</italic> and <italic>P2ry12</italic> and upregulation of genes such as <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Itgax</italic>, <italic>Clec7a</italic> and <italic>Cst7</italic>. Notably, the emergence of this subset is accelerated in female mice compared to male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). DAM/MGnD/ARM are believed to be highly phagocytic cells due to the enrichment of phagocytic and lipid-handling pathways in their gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Deczkowska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). However, the precise function of many of the genes that make up DAM/MGnD/ARM are poorly understood.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Cst7</italic>, coding for the protein cystatin F (CF), is amongst the most robustly upregulated genes in the DAM/MGnD/ARM signature. <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF expression appears to be driven by amyloid plaques as upregulation at both the RNA and protein level is spatially localized to plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ofengeim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). CF is atypical in that it is believed to play a role within the endolysosomal compartment where it acts as an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hamilton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). CF activity in neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells has been implicated in systemic inflammation and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Perišić Nanut <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sawyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, little is understood about the mechanistic role of CF in the context of central nervous system (CNS) disease. Some studies have suggested CF may play a protective role in a demyelination model by inhibiting cathepsin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) or negatively regulating microglial phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) but the possible disease-modifying role of <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF in amyloid-driven neurodegenerative disease is unknown. Additionally, although there is some evidence that <italic>Cst7</italic> itself is upregulated to a greater extent in female <italic>vs.</italic> male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guillot-Sestier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), the sex-specific role of <italic>Cst7</italic> in disease has not been investigated.</p><p id="P5">Here, we set out to investigate what, if any, disease-modifying role <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF may play in an amyloid-driven AD mouse model in both females and males. We first compiled data from published datasets to show that <italic>Cst7</italic> is indeed robustly and consistently upregulated in microglia across numerous amyloid-driven models of AD and that this upregulation appears greater in females. We then knocked out <italic>Cst7</italic> in male and female <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> knock-in mice which showed that <italic>Cst7</italic> drives sex-dependent changes in microglia at transcript, protein, and functional level. <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion in male mice led to downregulation of inflammatory transcripts and reduced lysosomal burden measured by LAMP2 immunostaining but had no effect on microglial Aβ burden <italic>in vivo</italic> or plaque deposition. However, in females, <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion led to increased expression of endolysosomal genes, increased lysosomal burden, and increased microglial Aβ burden <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further investigated this <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed that this is due to increased phagocytosis rather than impaired degradation. These data bring important insight to the functional role of <italic>Cst7</italic>, a key hallmark gene within the DAM/MGnD/ARM disease microglia signature. They also highlight that pathology-influencing effects are sex-dependent, underlining the interaction between sex and microglial function relevant to neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cst7/Cystatin F is upregulated in female and male microglia in murine models of AD</title><p id="P6"><italic>Cst7</italic> is often detected in RNASeq or scRNASeq databases as significantly upregulated in disease models. However, an integrated analysis of <italic>Cst7</italic> expression in disease models stratified by sex is lacking. Therefore, we searched publicly available datasets for <italic>Cst7</italic> expression in microglia in mouse models of AD. We integrated data from six studies in which microglial <italic>Cst7</italic> expression was profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Expression data was restricted to microglia by use of techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Orre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Srinivasan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), immunomagnetic separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guillot-Sestier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), RiboTag translational profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) or single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Many studies did not stratify according to sex. However, we were able to collect data on <italic>Cst7</italic> expression in males <italic>vs.</italic> females in the APP/PS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guillot-Sestier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). In all models, <italic>Cst7</italic> was dramatically upregulated in microglia in amyloid-driven disease. In models where we were able to compare sexes, <italic>Cst7</italic> was more highly expressed in female disease brains than in male. This is consistent with literature suggesting the transition to the DAM/ARM/MGnD microglial subset is accelerated in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). We also utilised published datasets from <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing (ISS), a process that allows for detection of specified transcripts with spatial resolution using barcoded probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Using this published dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alzmap.org">www.alzmap.org</ext-link>) we investigated <italic>Cst7</italic> expression in relation to Aβ plaques in 18-month <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). <italic>Cst7</italic> transcripts (red dots) were predominantly found near Aβ plaques, a pattern mirrored by microglial-specific DAM gene <italic>Trem2</italic> (yellow dots) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, these data identify <italic>Cst7</italic> as a key marker gene of the DAM/MGnD/ARM state and suggest that its disease-induced upregulation is related to Aβ plaque pathology.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cst7 deletion leads to sex-dependent transcriptomic changes in microglia in the App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> model of amyloid-driven AD</title><p id="P7">As <italic>Cst7</italic> is so robustly upregulated in microglia in amyloid-driven disease and some studies suggest this to be greater in female mice, we next aimed to investigate whether <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF plays a role in regulating microglia in disease and whether this regulation could be sex-dependent. Therefore, we crossed <italic>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> model of amyloid-driven AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) to generate background-matched non-disease (<italic>App<sup>Wt/Wt</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup>), disease (<italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) and disease knockout (App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. As <italic>Cst7</italic> expression is limited to the myeloid compartment in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), this study primarily tests the role of microglial/border-associated macrophages in amyloid-driven disease. We first investigated the role of <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF in regulating the microglial response in disease by unbiased analysis of the microglial transcriptome. Mice were aged to 12 months to drive Aβ plaque burden and a DAM/ARM microglial profile that includes marked upregulation of <italic>Cst7</italic> before microglia were isolated from hemi-brains by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Microglia were defined by FSC/SSC profile, singlet, live, CD11b+, Ly6C-, CD45+ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) and sorted along with phenotypic markers P2Y12, MHCII and CD11c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) before RNA purification, sequencing and analysis using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Love, Huber and Anders, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We first assessed disease-induced microglial changes by comparing <italic>App<sup>Wt/Wt</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> microglia in male and female mice. <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> knock-in led to numerous changes in gene transcription with 2022 genes upregulated and 1849 downregulated in males and 2053 upregulated and 1857 downregulated in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected, upregulated genes included DAM/ARM genes such as <italic>Clec7a</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Itgax</italic> and <italic>Csf1</italic>, whilst downregulated genes included microglial ‘homeostatic’ genes <italic>P2ry12</italic>, <italic>Tmem119</italic> and <italic>Gpr34</italic> in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C&amp;D</xref>). <italic>Cst7</italic> was among the top ten most highly upregulated genes in males and females. Interestingly, although there were relatively few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between male and female mice in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1A</xref>), these genes did include DAM/ARM genes such as <italic>Gpnmb</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic> and <italic>Ctse</italic>. This is consistent with the observation that the DAM/ARM profile is accelerated in females compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Having confirmed the upregulation of the <italic>Cst7</italic> and the DAM/ARM profile in this model, we next tested the role of <italic>Cst7</italic> in disease by comparing differential expression between the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> groups in both sexes. Importantly, <italic>Cst7</italic> itself was the most differentially expressed gene in both sexes, confirming successful deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion led to significant changes in microglial transcriptome. In females, <italic>Cst7</italic> knockout led to upregulation of 15 genes and downregulation of two genes (including <italic>Cst7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Despite the modest number of differentially expressed genes, we observed that many of the upregulated genes appeared to be involved in endolysosomal-related processes such as protein trafficking to organelles (<italic>Sort1</italic>, <italic>Sec16a</italic>) and antigen-presentation (<italic>Lilrb4</italic>, <italic>Igkc</italic>). Enrichment analyses revealed that female <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> microglia were significantly enriched in GO:BP (Gene ontology: biological process) terms such as ‘plasma membrane to endosome transport’, ‘aggrephagy’ and ‘phagocytosis’ against their <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we tested whether <italic>Cst7</italic> knockout led to the same effect in males as in females. Surprisingly, we observed that male <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> microglia exhibited markedly different transcriptome compared to <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> with upregulation of eight genes and downregulation of 51 genes (including <italic>Cst7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). In contrast to females, downregulated genes in males were dominated by classical proinflammatory mediators such as <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il1a</italic>, <italic>T</italic>nf and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> and enrichment analyses revealed downregulation of GO:BP terms such as ‘cellular response to lipopolysaccharide’, inflammatory response’, and ‘NF-kappaB signaling’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Notably, many disease-induced genes followed an intriguing pattern of being suppressed in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7<sup>-/-</sup> vs. App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> in males but potentiated in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7<sup>-/-</sup> vs. App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> in females. Examples of this are immunoglobulin receptor gene <italic>Lilrb4a</italic> and inflammatory gene <italic>Cxcl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I&amp;J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Cst7</italic> also appeared to drive a sex-genotype interaction effect. We determined male <italic>vs.</italic> female differentially expressed genes in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and their <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> counterparts. In <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> microglia, there were 33 DEGs between male <italic>vs.</italic> female approximately evenly split between transcripts enriched in males <italic>vs.</italic> those enriched in females, whereas in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> we observed 240 DEGs dominated by those enriched in females. These transcripts included inflammatory genes such as <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Together, these data show that <italic>Cst7</italic> drives sex-dependent effects on microglial transcriptome in an amyloid-driven mouse model of AD. <italic>Cst7</italic> knockout led to an upregulation of a small set of endolysosomal-enriched genes in female microglia but a striking downregulation of inflammatory genes in male microglia. The number of DEGs between <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> males and females was markedly greater in the <italic>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> state, implying a sex-genotype interaction effect i.e. the impact of <italic>Cst7</italic> deficiency on microglial phenotype in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic>-driven disease differs quantitatively and qualitatively (e.g. in endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways) according to sex.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>Cst7</italic> deletion leads to region and sex-dependent changes in lysosomes in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice</title><p id="P12">Following our investigation into the <italic>Cst7</italic>-dependent effects on microglia at the transcriptome level, we next sought to study changes at the protein level with spatial resolution. This allowed us to investigate brain region-dependent effects. We took sagittal brain sections from 12-month male and female <italic>App<sup>Wt/Wt</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and immunostained for IBA1 to visualise microglia, anti- Aβ clone 6E10 to visualise Aβ, and, as both previous literature and our RNASeq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> implicated lysosomes in <italic>Cst7</italic> function, LAMP2 to visualise lysosomes. We assessed three brain regions: cortex, whole hippocampus, and the dorsal subiculum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>), to investigate the effects of disease and <italic>Cst7</italic> knockout on microglial burden and lysosomal activation. As expected, knock-in of the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> construct led to marked build-up of 6E10+ Aβ plaques, an increase in IBA1+ microglial burden around these plaques, and upregulation of LAMP2 in microglia predominantly in plaque-associated microglia in both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). LAMP2 predominantly colocalised with IBA1, suggesting that expression is predominantly in mononuclear phagocytes rather than neuronal cells or macroglia. Next, we compared <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7<sup>+/+</sup> vs. App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> male and female mice.

We utilized Congo Red-derivative methoxy-X04 (MeX04), which binds selectively to fibrillar β-sheet-rich structures such as the dense cores of amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">DeTure and Dickson, 2019</xref>), compared to anti-Aβ antibody 6E10, which will bind both dense cores and diffuse outers to study plaque composition in different brain regions of <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). MeX04 was injected intraperitoneally 2.5 h before mice were sacrificed and brains taken for histology.

Notably, a transcriptomic profile has emerged involving <italic>Trem2</italic>-dependent downregulation of homeostatic genes and upregulation of a signature characterised by genes involved in phagocytosis, lipid handling, and endolysosomal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Deczkowska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).

However, beyond gene ontology analysis, there is surprisingly little understanding of what many of the hallmark genes comprising this signature functionally do in the context of neurodegenerative disease. This is the first study to our knowledge to test the functional role of <italic>Cst7</italic>, one of the most consistently replicated markers of this cell state transcriptomic signature, in β-amyloid-driven pathology. Perhaps counterintuitively, <italic>Cst7</italic> (a reported cysteine protease inhibitor) is robustly upregulated in microglia alongside concomitant upregulation of cysteine proteases such as cathepsins D, B, L, and Z. In fact, such internal regulation systems are not uncommon in inflammation biology, where proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and IL-18 are negatively regulated by co-expressed IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-18 binding protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hurme and Santtila, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dinarello <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We therefore hypothesise that <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF is upregulated along with numerous cathepsin genes in order to prevent potentially harmful protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Turk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this study, we show that <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF knockout triggers an increase in microglial lysosomal activity and amyloid uptake. Intriguingly, this did not seem to depend on overactive intracellular cathepsin activity, which intuitively would have been expected to increase with the lack of negative regulator. It is possible that CF does in fact lead to an increase in cathepsin activity, but CF itself it is secreted and only impairs secreted cathepsins which are responsible for promoting phagocytosis. Indeed, studies have suggested that CF can be secreted and that there is a role for secreted cathepsins in phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liuzzo, Petanceska and Devi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hamilton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Another key implication from this study is that of sexual dimorphism in disease. Here, we show stark differences in the effect of <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion between males and females at both the gene and protein level.

In general, male microglia are believed to have higher baseline activity in processes such as inflammation, antigen presentation, and phagocytosis; whereas female microglia are more associated with neuroprotection and the DAM/ARM/MGnD signature in ageing and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guneykaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kodama and Gan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Villa, Della Torre and Maggi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guillot-Sestier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Female microglia also develop ‘faster’ than male microglia resulting in differential response to inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hanamsagar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These differences are only partially dependent on hormonal signalling as masculinisation of females by ovariectomy and hormone replacement only partially recapitulated male microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Villa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Indeed, sexual dimorphism of microglia in adults appears a cell-intrinsic phenomenon as female microglia transplanted in male brains retain their transcriptional profile and reduce infarct size in males after ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Villa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we generally do not observe marked sexual dimorphism in microglia in wild-type or <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. However, DAM/ARM/MGnD gene expression was higher in female <italic>vs.</italic> male microglia and lysosomal activity was markedly higher in male <italic>vs.</italic> female brains measured by LAMP2 staining, which is consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guneykaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sala Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Importantly, we observed a substantial interaction effect of <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion and sex, whereby removal of the <italic>Cst7</italic> gene led to an ‘unlocking’ of sexual dimorphism in our cohort. This is most clearly demonstrated by differentially expressed genes between male <italic>vs.</italic> female microglia rising from 33 in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice to 240 in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. This sex-dependent interaction effect has previously been observed in studies investigating the cystatin/cathepsin system, where deletion of <italic>Cst3</italic> (cystatin C) led to protection in the EAE-model of multiple sclerosis in females but not males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hoghooghi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).This effect appeared to be sensitive to hormones as ovariectomy or castration followed by testosterone or estrogen/progesterone administration effectively reversed the effect of <italic>Cst3</italic> knockout. Indeed, sex:genetics interactions are not uncommon in neurodegenerative disease, with various risk variants posing greater or lesser effect on risk in men or women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gamache, Yun and Chiba-Falek, 2020</xref>). One example of this interaction is <italic>APOE</italic>, in which the presence of the E4 allele confers a greater AD risk in women than in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Altmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="S10"><title>Ideas and Speculation</title><p id="P25">Here, we observed that <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF played a role in microglial amyloid uptake and endolysosomal gene expression only in females. Surprisingly, this did not lead to a decrease in Aβ plaque pathology as might be expected but an increase, although of modest degree, in specific brain areas. This discovery raises the important question of the relationship between microglial phagocytosis and plaques. It is generally considered that an increase in microglial phagocytosis should lead to reduction in plaque burden and benefit in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Heneka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tejera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). However, recent studies have emerged to suggest that phagocytosing microglia may in fact act to ‘build’ plaques rather than dismantle them. For example, microglia lacking TAM receptors Axl and Mer fail to take up Aβ which leads to an overall decrease in dense-core plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), microglia can ‘seed’ plaques from disease tissue into engrafted, non-affected regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">d’Errico <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) and either genetic or pharmacological depletion of microglia leads to a reduction in plaque burden/intensity accompanied by increase in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Spangenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kiani Shabestari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).

Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating CF/<italic>CST7</italic> in human microglia differentiated from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would be valuable, our discovery that CF function is revealed in mouse microglia only when cells are taken from disease context would suggest more complex models are required. Finally, while this study details the discovery of the mechanistic role of CF/<italic>Cst7</italic> in an amyloid-driven AD model, the precise mechanism by which <italic>Cst7</italic> deletion affects microglia only in females, and the biological reason for the accelerated DAM/MGnD/ARM programme in females remains unknown. Future work should investigate this further with ovariectomy/hormone replacement and transplantation studies as those performed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Villa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P27">In summary, our data provide key mechanistic insight into the role of one of the most robustly upregulated genes in reactive microglia. These data suggest that <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF regulates some key aspects of microglial function, in a sex-dependent manner, and that these are associated with pathology-influencing effects in an amyloid-driven AD model that also manifest differently in males and females. We hypothesise that <italic>Cst7</italic>/CF plays a part in an internal regulatory system that balances the two crucial processes of phagocytosis and inflammatory signalling, which are sexually dimorphic processes. More broadly, and in view of the poorly understood functions of many other recently described hallmark microglial disease-related state mediators, it is imperative to consider interactions with sex when investigating their cellular and disease roles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Animals</title><p id="P28"><italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice were provided by the RIKEN BRC through the National BioResource Project of the MEXT/AMED, Japan. <italic>Cst7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were obtained from Colin Watts, University of Dundee, UK.
