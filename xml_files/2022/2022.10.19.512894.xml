DN is a complex disease and its progression, particularly in type 2 diabetes, is confounded by multiple pathogenic factors, such as insulin resistance and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Previous studies used single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq) to investigate cellular changes or drug responses in diabetic kidneys. Single-nucleus transcriptomics on early human diabetic kidneys suggests increased potassium secretion in the distal nephron and pro-angiogenic signaling in diverse kidney cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. A following study combining single-nucleus RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing highlights the glucocorticoid signaling in the proximal tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Stefansson et al. provide molecular programs associated with glomerular hyperfiltration in human DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and Fu et al. show the single-cell transcriptomics of eNOS -/- mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, which is a type 1 diabetes model without obesity nor insulin-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Single-cell/nucleus transcriptomics on drug treated murine diabetic kidneys suggest important alterations in proximal tubule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P3">DN is characterized by distinct histopathological lesions dominating the renal glomerulus, such as glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening, mesangial expansion and nodular glomerulosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Early changes such as glomerular hyperfiltration have been proposed to be critical for the subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Preservation of glomerular filtration rate is of great importance for renoprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. However, the signaling pathways that initiate these glomerular alterations are incompletely understood. Therefore, it is particularly warranted to understand the cellular changes and molecular mechanisms that initiate DN in the glomerulus.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of cellular changes in type 2 diabetic glomeruli. The type 2 diabetes mouse model BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> exhibits insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and obesity, as well as the rapid progression of diabetic glomerulopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We generated single-cell transcriptomics of kidneys and bulk transcriptomics of purified glomerular cell types. We compared mouse DN with human DN and validated our findings in different patient cohort datasets at both mRNA and protein levels. Our study reveals the upregulation of mechanosensitive signaling pathway MRTF-SRF in response to glomerular hyperfiltration, which is associated with glomerulopathy in early DN.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>scRNA-seq of BTBR ob/ob mouse kidneys with early DN</title><p id="P5">We generated BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> podocyte-reporter mice (BTBR.Cg-Lep<sup>ob/ob WiscJ</sup>;Gt (ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup>;Tg(NPHS2-cre)<sup>295Lbh</sup>; hereafter referred to as BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> or DN mice) to investigate the cellular and molecular changes that occur in DN. By 6 weeks of age, both male and female BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice exhibited obesity, hyperglycemia, and albuminuria (Supplementary Fig. 1a). From 12 weeks of age, obvious glomerular hypertrophy was observed in histological analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Mesangial expansion with accumulation of collagen IV was detected in the DN glomeruli (Supplementary Fig. 1c and d). Based on these observations, we defined 6 weeks of age as the onset stage of DN and 12 weeks of age as the early stage of DN.</p><p id="P6">Kidney tissue was sampled from a total of 16 mice, including male and female each of BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> (DN) and BTBR WT (control) mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age. The samples were partially depleted of the proximal tubule (PT) segment using a Percoll gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] to enrich glomeruli. Single-cell suspensions were prepared using cold-active protease (CAP) to reduce dissociation-induced artifacts in kidney cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. A total of 70,944 single cells were profiled after data pre-processing and quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Unsupervised clustering identified 21 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b and c; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). The cells in the 21 clusters were classified into 19 cell types and annotated on the basis of cell-specific marker genes reported in previous kidney and glomerulus single-cell data (14-16). Defining marker genes for each cell type and unbiased marker genes for each cluster are demonstrated in a dot plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and in a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2d), respectively.</p><p id="P7">We identified all major components in the kidneys. The endothelial cell (EC) subtypes expressed distinct marker genes, such as <italic>Ehd3</italic> for EC_1 (glomerular ECs/gECs), <italic>Plvap</italic> for EC_2 (fenestrated ECs with diaphragm in veins and peritubular capillaries) and <italic>Fbln2</italic> for EC_3 (arteriolar and arterial ECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Mesangial cells defined by marker genes <italic>Gata3, Itga8</italic> and <italic>Adamts5</italic> are clearly distinguished from interstitial cells, which were compose of vascular smooth muscle cells marked by <italic>Acta2</italic> and <italic>Tagln</italic>, and renin cells marked by <italic>Ren1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The subtype PT_1 and PT_2 were composed of cells from S1/2 and S2/3 PT segments, respectively, as they showed a continuum of marker gene expression consistent with known S1 (<italic>Slc5a2, Slc5a12</italic> and <italic>Gatm</italic>) to S3 (<italic>Slc13a3, Cyp4a10</italic> and <italic>Slc5a8</italic>) PT segments.</p><p id="P8">Due to PT depletion, the percentage of PT cells was reduced to 22.4%, while glomerular cell types were enriched to 15.6% (Supplementary Fig. 2e). The fractions of control and DN cells in each cell type were similar except for podocytes, which included more control (approximately 77%, 807 cells) than DN cells (approximately 23%, 235 cells) (Supplementary Fig. 2f). All cell types were identified in individual kidney samples (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and cells from individual kidney samples were also identified for each cell type (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The overall low expression of dissociation-induced stress genes in individual cell types (Supplementary Fig. 3c) indicates the advantages of our modified single-cell preparation protocol (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), which shortened the 37°C digestion time and omitted the steps stressful to glomerular cell dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell type-specific alterations in DN kidneys suggest glucose-dependent and glucose-independent responses in diabetes</title><p id="P9">Next, we compared gene expression levels in DN versus control kidneys by cell type. In total, we identified 447 and 740 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across all cell types at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Among all cell types, mesangial cells and PT cells had the highest numbers of DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), indicating that these two cell types were predominantly affected in the early stage of DN. Enrichment analysis identified significant pathways in glomerular cell types and PT cell types at 6 and 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e and f</xref>). Glomerular cell types showed regulations of extracellular matrix molecules, cell adhesion, cell proliferation etc. and cellular responses to mechanic stress, cytokines and blood pressure. PT cell types showed multiple metabolic processes such as biological oxidations, and responses involved in oxidative stress, such as NRF2 and PPAR signaling pathways. These differences suggest glucose-dependent and glucose-independent responses in PT and glomerular cell types in early DN, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Shared features of human and experimental DN</title><p id="P10">Early changes such as glomerular hypertrophy, GBM thickening and mesangial expansion occur in both human and animal DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, we conducted intensive analyses on glomerular cell types.</p><p id="P11">We isolated glomeruli from BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> and BTBR WT kidneys and subsequently purified podocytes, mesangial cells and gECs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Bulk RNA-seq was performed for each purified glomerular cell type. The similarity and purity of individual glomerular cell type samples were controlled by principal component analysis (PCA) and the expression levels of specific marker genes (Supplementary Fig. 5). The cell gene expression data from scRNA-seq were compared to the bulk RNA-seq data. Podocytes, EC_1/gECs and mesangial cells showed positive Pearson correlation coefficients, suggesting a linear correlation of the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Overlapping the glomerular DEGs from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets resulted in 194 unique genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), which were mapped to the European Renal cDNA Bank (ERCB) patient dataset. The mRNA expression of 106 genes was significantly regulated in microdissected glomeruli from DN patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>). Importantly, most DEGs detected in human DN glomeruli were significantly changed in mesangial cells in both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators are activated in DN glomeruli</title><p id="P12">To identify the transcriptional regulations responsible for the differential expression of genes in DN glomerular cell types, we performed upstream analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), which identifies not only transcription factors but also transcription coregulators such as coactivators. Transcriptional regulators commonly changed in single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>. Changes in transcriptional regulations were predominant in mesangial cells. Intriguingly, we observed the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators, including coactivators myocardin-related transcription factor A and B (MRTFA/B) and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1 or YAP), as well as the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF).</p><p id="P13">Additionally, the gene regulatory network was inferred using SCENIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] to determine the cell-type specific activity of transcription factors (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Consistently, the activity of SRF was high in mesangial cells, and moderate or low in podocytes and gECs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The MRTF-SRF transcriptional target genes with significant regulations in DN glomerular cell types are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>. Notably, the MRTF-SRF-specific targets <italic>Acta2</italic> and <italic>Tagln</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] were found in both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data. Enrichment analysis of significantly changed MRTF transcriptional target genes suggested regulations of smooth muscle proliferation, actin cytoskeleton, integrin cell surface interactions and extracellular matrix organization etc. (Supplementary Fig. 6c).</p><p id="P15">MRTF-SRF is an important mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. MRTF family consists of myocardin, MRTFA (MKL1, MAL) and MRTFB (MKL2). Unlike myocardin, which is limited to myocardial cells and smooth muscle cells, MRTFA and MRTFB are found in various cells and tissues including the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Mechanical stresses lead to the translocation of cytoplasmic MRTF into the nucleus to initiate the SRF-mediated transcriptional responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We investigated the expression and location of MRTFA and MRTFB in mouse DN by immunofluorescent staining. MRTFA and MRTFB were found in the cytoplasm and nuclei of podocytes and gECs, exhibiting comparable expression levels in both control and DN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Mesangial cells exhibited a low expression level of MRTFA in control mice, while some of the mesangial cells exhibited nuclear accumulation of MRTFA in DN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). MRTFB expression was absent in most mesangial cells in control mice, but its expression level was clearly increased in DN mice. Importantly, nuclear accumulation of MRTFB in mesangial cells was obvious to detect especially in the region where mesangial expansion was taking place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MRTF transcriptional target genes are upregulated in DN patients with type 2 diabetes</title><p id="P16">We investigated the expression of MRTF transcriptional target genes in an early DN cohort of Pima Indians from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, individuals with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. mRNA expression analysis of microdissected glomeruli showed that various genes significantly changed in mouse DN were also significantly regulated in early human DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Many of these target genes were positively correlated with mesangial volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Independent single-nucleus transcriptomics data from early human DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] showed that these MRTF transcription genes were mostly regulated in mesangial cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The MRTF transcriptional target genes were mapped in the ERCB dataset. These genes were significantly regulated in glomeruli in the context of DN and other diseases potentially causing mechanical stresses, such as arterial hypertension, as well as various other glomerular diseases with glomerulosclerosis, such as lupus nephritis (caused by systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) and IgA nephropathy, but not in minimal change disease (MCD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, we investigated the expression and location of MRTFA and MRTFB in early human DN by immunofluorescent staining. A basal and comparable expression level of MRTFA was detected in all three glomerular cell types in both healthy and early DN kidney biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Consistent with the observations in mouse DN, MRTFB was absent in most mesangial cells from healthy individuals but was accumulated in the nuclei of mesangial cells where glomerular lesions were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Taken together, our immunofluorescent staining analyses on human and mouse DN confirm the activation of MRTFB in mesangial cells during early DN.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mesangial cells exhibit dominant signaling networks in DN glomeruli</title><p id="P18">Our results suggested that MRTF-SRF transcriptional regulation was activated in both mouse and human DN, predominantly in mesangial cells. Additionally, we identified various mesangial cell marker genes that encode transmembrane proteins responsible for the perception and transduction of mechanical signals, including mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), GPCRs, integrins and cadherins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Furthermore, we performed CellChat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] to study the changes of intercellular communications (secreted signaling, cell-cell contact and ECM-receptor) taking place in DN. We compared interaction strength between all kidney cell types in DN versus control mice, which showed dominating interactions of mesangial cells with all other cell types in DN kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Additionally, mesangial cells dominated the intercellular communications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and interacted as a sender extensively with gECs and podocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>) in DN glomeruli. These interactions involved various well-known growth factor signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as interactions between multiple extracellular matrix proteins and integrins. Notably, the BMP2/4 signaling pathways identified in DN mesangial cell interactions contribute to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, particularly in DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Kidney ex vivo perfusion activates mechanosensitive signaling pathways</title><p id="P19">Glomerular hyperfiltration as a consequence of increased single-nephron glomerular filtration rate may be a common upstream mechanism contributing to CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In diabetes, glomerular hyperfiltration is driven by the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Hyper-reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the PT ultimately leads to restricted tubuloglomerular feedback, resulting in increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Consequently, circumferential and axial capillary wall stress, as well as fluid shear stress at the glomerular filtration barrier is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Since the mechanosensitive signaling pathway MRTF-SRF is a central coordinator of fibrosis-relevant mechanoresponse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], we hypothesize that glomerular hyperfiltration may directly activate MRTF-SRF, leading to cellular changes associated with diabetic glomerulopathy.</p><p id="P20">We used normothermic machine perfusion to proof this hypothesis. The ex vivo kidney perfusion takes place for 1 to 2 hours at 100 mmHg with 100% Gey’s Balanced Salt Solution (GBSS) without the addition of albumin or red blood cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Under this condition, tubular glomerular feedback is absent and 100 mmHg is a supraphysiologic pressure leading to glomerular hyperfiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P21">We generated bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomics data of isolated mouse glomeruli and pig renal cortex tissue, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a, d</xref>), and gene expression was compared in perfused versus unperfused conditions. In ex vivo perfused mouse glomeruli, upstream analysis in DEGs suggested activation of MRTFA/B, SRF and YAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>).

In ex vivo perfused pig kidney, a total of 11,692 single nuclei were profiled from perfused and unperfused renal cortex tissue. Unsupervised clustering identified 18 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7b), which were classified into 12 cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 7c) on the basis of cell/nucleus-specific marker genes reported for previous human kidney single-nucleus data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. We identified the major glomerular cell types including a stromal cell type (indicated by “STROMA” in figures) defined by the nucleus marker gene MEIS1 and FHL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Immunofluorescent staining on the pig renal cortex showed that MEIS1-positive cells were mainly composed of mesangial cells, but also some interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>). Upstream analysis on DEGs revealed the activation of MRTFA/B, SRF and YAP1 in stromal cells, as well as the activation of YAP1 and MRTFB in podocytes and endothelial cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7h</xref>). Significantly regulated MRTF transcriptional target genes were found predominantly in stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7i</xref>). These findings support our hypothesis that the activation of mechanosensitive signaling pathways is a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> is a useful mouse model to investigate cellular changes and molecular mechanisms in early DN. Integrative analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data led to the identification of the mechanosensitive pathway MRTF-SRF in DN glomeruli. The association of MRTF-SRF activation with human DN was validated in independent patient cohorts at both mRNA and protein levels, and MRTF-SRF is suggested as a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.</p><p id="P23">Single-cell analysis on BTBR <italic>ob/ob</italic> kidneys suggested that PT cells and mesangial cells are the most sensitive cells to hyperglycemia and initiate glucose-dependent and glucose-independent downstream pathways in response to stress in the kidneys, respectively. PT cells showed adaptations to glucose metabolic fluxes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways. Increased glucose influx in cells fuels oxidative phosphorylation, leading to overproduction of superoxide by mitochondria and generation of reactive oxygen species, which play a central role in initiating diverse pathways responsible for diabetic abnormalities such as cellular dysfunction, inflammation and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Mesangial cells showed the activation of other signaling pathways obviously independent of glucose metabolic flux. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies showing that overexpression of GLUT1 in mesangial cells exposed to high glucose fails to induce TGF-β1 synthesis and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and that transgenic mice with GLUT1 overexpression in mesangial cells do not develop pathological phenotypes until 26 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P24">Mouse DN glomeruli exhibited shared features with human DN glomeruli. Approximately 70% glomerular DEGs identified in DN mice were also significantly regulated in DN patients. Importantly, MRTF-SRF transcriptional target genes were significantly regulated in both mouse and human DN glomeruli. Notably, mesangial cells responded at the earliest time point and showed a persistent activation of MRTFB compared to podocytes and gECs. Immunofluorescent staining further confirmed the activation of MRTFB in the region where mesangial expansion was taking place. Mechanic stimulation triggers cytoskeleton remodeling, resulting in the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway MRTF-SRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], which plays a key role in organ fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Upon stimulation, cytoplasmic MRTF translocate to the nucleus and interact with SRF to target the expression of muscle-specific and contractile genes, as well as extracellular matrix genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, single-cell data showed mesangial cell expression of numerous genes that encode transmembrane proteins responsible for the perception and transduction of mechanical signals. DN mesangial cells exhibited dominant signaling network in the whole kidney, interacted with gECs and podocytes by ECM and secreted signaling. These results suggest that MRTF-SRF transcriptional regulation in mesangial cells could be an important pathological pathway contributing to diabetic glomerulopathy.</p><p id="P25">Since the mechanical stress caused by glomerular hyperfiltration is thought to play a critical role in the development of glomerulopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], we speculate that glomerular hyperfiltration, a key event in early DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], directly activates mechanosensitive signaling pathways in renal glomeruli, and consequently contribute to diabetic glomerulopathy. This speculation is supported by evidence in our study. First, single-cell and bulk RNA-seq of DN mice showed activation of MRTFA/B in three major glomerular cell types, which was also observed in an early DN cohort. Second, ex vivo kidney perfusion induced glomerular hyperfiltration showed a prominent activation of MRTFA/B, SRF and YAP1 in mouse glomeruli. Third, snRNA-seq of perfused pig renal cortex tissue showed activation of these mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators, which were most prominently activated in stromal cells composing mesangial cells.</p><p id="P26">Many MRTF target genes were significantly regulated not only in DN but also in the context of other glomerular diseases associated with glomerulosclerosis. These findings suggest a common role of MRTF in diabetic glomerulopathy, as well as in glomerulosclerosis generally. Previous studies demonstrated that MRTF-SRF and YAP are essential for podocyte structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was diminished in MRTFA-deficient mice and MRTFA was activated in high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In addition, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of MRTF attenuates fibrosis in various pathological conditions, including kidney diseases like diabetic nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, acute kidney injury, and polycystic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Therefore, MRTF is important for glomerular cells and is a potential therapeutic target for DN, as well as glomerulosclerosis.</p><p id="P27">Finally, while the principle of SGLT-2 inhibition has been proven to be the major advance in slowing down CKD, the mechanisms remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It was proposed that a lowering of the intraglomerular pressure by SGLT-2 inhibition might drive the renal protective effects. Our results unravel now mechanosensitive signalling pathways as possible mediators of SGLT-2 dependent effects, opening the search of novel druggable downstream targets of SGLT-2.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early DN and reveals cell-specific alterations in gene expression that occur with DN onset and progression. Our intensive analysis of glomerular cell types reveals that the mechanosensitive signaling is associated with diabetic glomerulopathy and could play a driving role in response to glomerular hyperfiltration. The MRTF transcription pathway may be part of a common mechanism in the glomerulus in the context of glomerulosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Animals</title><p id="P29">All animal experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as well as the German law for the welfare of animals.
