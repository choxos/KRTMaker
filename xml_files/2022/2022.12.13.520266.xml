The contrast of interferometric scattering microscopy is amplified through a photonic crystal surface, upon which scattered light from an object combines with illumination from a monochromatic plane wave source. The use of a photonic crystal substrate for interference scattering microscopy results in reduced requirements for high-intensity lasers or oil-immersion objectives, thus opening a pathway toward instruments that are more suitable for environments outside the optics laboratory. Here, we report the design, implementation, and characterization of a compact Photonic Resonator Interferometric Scattering Microscope (PRISM) designed for point-of-use environments and applications. The instrument incorporates two innovative elements that facilitate operation on a desktop in ordinary laboratory environments by users that do not have optics expertise. First, because scattering microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration, we incorporated an inexpensive but effective solution of suspending the instrument’s main components from a rigid metal framework using elastic bands, resulting in an average of 28.7 dBV reduction in vibration amplitude compared to an office desk. Second, an automated focusing module based on the principle of total internal reflection maintains the stability of image contrast over time and spatial position, facilitating automated data collection. In this work, we characterize the system's performance by measuring the contrast from gold nanoparticles with diameters in the 10-40 nm range and by observing various biological analytes, including HIV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosomes, and ferritin protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Interferometric scattering microscopy</kwd><kwd>photonic crystals</kwd><kwd>label-free</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>vibration isolation</kwd><kwd>autofocus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability to detect and characterize biological nano-objects at digital resolution without extrinsic labels or labor-intensive assay preparation is the core advantage of interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). Since its introduction nearly two decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], iSCAT has attracted significant interest in the field of bioimaging applications, including biomolecular and nanomaterial mass photometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], protein interaction and oligomerization characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], three-dimensional particle tracking, and nanoparticle classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Imaging contrast in iSCAT relies on the fact that the detected signal is linearly dependent upon the volume of the scattering particle rather than the volume squared, as for pure scattering-based microscopies. The linearity is a result of the interference cross-term between the object-scattered light and the background reference light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Consequently, by carefully manipulating the intensity ratio between the two light sources, one could push the detection limit for protein molecules to molecular weights as small as 65 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. One way to enhance the signal contrast is by attenuating the overwhelming reference light intensity through methods such as thin film interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], back focal plane engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and polarization filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Alternatively, the scattered light can be strengthened to increase the magnitude of the detected signal. For example, surface plasmon resonance has been employed in conjunction with iSCAT to improve the ratio between the scattered light intensity and the background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Similarly, metallic nanoparticles exhibit an enhanced scattering cross section under localized surface plasmon resonance conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], enabling their use as labels for biosensing applications with iSCAT instruments.</p><p id="P3">Recently, we demonstrated the concept of utilizing a resonantly reflective photonic crystal (PC) metamaterial surface in combination with iSCAT to enhance scattered field intensity while also reducing the magnitude of background reference light intensity that interferes with scattered light from the detected nano-object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], in an approach called Photonic Resonator Interferometric Scattering Microscopy (PRISM). In PRISM, the PC periodic structure is resonant with the wavelength of the laser illumination, resulting in the formation of electromagnetic standing waves in the form of surface-confined evanescent fields. As the electric field magnitude of the standing waves is magnified with respect to the electric field of the illumination source, we showed that the PC surface enhances the scattering cross-section of the nano-objects up to nearly 300-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In addition, by illuminating the PC at the combination of wavelength and incident angle that results in nearly 100% reflection intensity (as dictated by the PC forbidden band) the transmitted reference light that combines with the forward-scattered light before reaching the image sensor is significantly attenuated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Importantly, the enhanced scattering intensity provided by the PC resonance in PRISM enables the instrument to achieve high scattered intensity while using a relatively inexpensive, compact, and low-power (100 mW) laser compared to the Watt-level lasers used in several reported iSCAT instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Further, as the PC surface has the capability for directing out-scattered photons following its dispersion characteristic, the emerging scattered light is efficiently collected into the numerical aperture of an inexpensive and wide field of view (FOV) air-spaced objective lens (0.75NA), thus removing the need for oil-immersion, high numerical aperture objectives used in conventional iSCAT instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The synergistic combination of PC surfaces as a substrate for performing iSCAT microscopy offers a route toward the detection and quantification of biological analytes in complex media, particularly when a selective recognition molecule is immobilized on the PC surface that enables it to capture a specific target. For example, using PRISM with PC surfaces prepared with an immobilized aptamer that selectively binds with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrated direct, rapid, 1-step, room temperature detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva with detection limits similar to laboratory-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. There are many potential applications for interferometric microscopy in the contexts of molecular diagnostics (for example, using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as tags for surface-captured molecules), viral diagnostics, and as a technology platform for a variety of life science research applications. These factors provide motivation to explore the development of compact and inexpensive instruments that can operate effectively without an optical bench, while automating some of the manual operations, such as the need to continuously maintain accurate focusing, to make the technique more accessible by users without an optics background.</p><p id="P4">Interferometric scattering microscopy faces inherent challenges for implementation outside of an optics laboratory due to the stringent requirements on the imaging condition. The interferometric nature of iSCAT and PRISM results in a bright-fringe system, where a weak signal intensity change must be detected on an overwhelming background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. This characteristic makes scattering-based microscopes vulnerable to signal fluctuations caused by external factors such as mechanical vibration and laser power instability. Therefore, most scattering microscopes are placed on air-damped optical tables for vibration isolation. Meanwhile, as the scattered signal scales with the intensity of illumination, scattering microscopes are often equipped with Class 4 lasers in the blue part of the optical spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. An efficient collection of scattered photons from inherently small objects generally dictates the selection of an oil-immersion objective lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. For diagnostic and life science research applications, where the detection instrument may be situated in a clinical laboratory or a biology-oriented laboratory, the environment places a limit on the space, budget, and available laser safety infrastructure, which renders some of these components impractical. Similar goals have motivated the development of portable fluorescence microscopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In this report, we describe the design, implementation, and characterization of a PRISM instrument that is intended for use in environments besides optical laboratories, in which the system will provide sufficient contrast for the detection of nanoparticles, virions, exosomes, and large protein molecules while operating on a normal tabletop where extraneous vibration noise sources are present. The system incorporates the advantages reported initially for PRISM (reduced laser power, air-spaced objective) while also integrating an inexpensive (but effective) vibration isolation system based upon an elastic band suspension. The newly-developed instrument described in this report also incorporates an autofocus system that further stabilizes image contrast for extended time periods, while enabling the sensor to be rapidly translated to gather images from different locations, which facilitates the collection of “tiled” images that cover extended fields of view. The autofocus function is implemented by incorporating an additional light path to the sample without introducing significant background light intensity. After describing and characterizing the performance of the vibration isolation and autofocus capability, we characterize the system's performance for sensing nano-objects by measuring the contrast from AuNPs with diameters in the 10-40 nm range. To demonstrate the capability of the system for observing various biological analytes, we challenged the system to detect HIV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosomes, and ferritin protein. In this work, the viruses are non-infectious pseudoviruses that retain the size and outer protein configuration of the native virus, without the presence of the infectious viral genome. Overall, we demonstrate a more portable and cost-effective version of the PRISM instrument that does not sacrifice detection capability for several important applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Instrument implementation</title><p id="P6">The optical assembly of the instrument can be separated into two major parts, namely the imaging component and the autofocus module, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>. The imaging component uses a temperature-controlled 100mW (Class 3) laser diode (Thorlabs) emitting at 633 nm as the light source, which provides illumination to the sample in the Köhler configuration. The emitted light is then collimated, phase-shifted, and reshaped before entering the illumination objective lens (50X, NA = 0.5, Olympus) with polarization along the direction of the gratings on the PC surface. While the PC is illuminated at the resonance condition, only less than 0.5% of the incident light is transmitted, which interferes with the enhanced scattered light collected by the imaging objective lens (50X, NA = 0.75, Zeiss) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>), forming an interferometric signal at the imaging sensor (Grasshopper3, Teledyne FLIR). The measured field of view (FOV) using a test target is 155 × 185 um<sup>2</sup> with full-pixel utilization (2448 ×2048) at a frame rate of 75Hz. The FOV is then reduced to 512 × 512 pixels for a higher frame rate (530 Hz) and faster real-time data processing. The autofocus module uses an infrared laser diode (Edmunds Optics) emitting at 850 nm and is reshaped into a circular profile by an iris. A neutral density filter is applied to attenuate the autofocus laser power so that minimal light reaches the sample, avoiding unwanted background signal increase. The incident infrared light is reflected by a knife-edge prism mirror and a short-pass dichroic mirror (cutoff wavelength = 805 nm) before entering the back aperture of the imaging objective lens. The total internal reflected light follows the same path as the incident light, except it is reflected by the other side of the knife-edge prism mirror and is focused by a cylindrical lens onto the autofocus camera (Blackfly S, Teledyne FLIR) for further processing. A detailed component list can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.</p><p id="P7">For the sake of vibration isolation and operator safety, the optical assembly is enclosed within a metal framework and is suspended by six elastic bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>). The elastic bands connect the optical breadboard to the girder and are stretched to ~120% compared to their relaxed state. Light-absorbing hard boards cover the outer surface of the frame except for a small sliding window for sample loading. The enclosure blocks the ambient light from reaching the two cameras and prevents the laser light from escaping. The compact size of the instrument (15 × 27 × 18 in<sup>3</sup>) allows it to be placed on a wheeled table.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Photonic crystal fabrication</title><p id="P8">As reported in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], the PCs are nanostructured surfaces comprised of linear gratings (period = 380nm, depth = 97 nm, duty cycle = 65%) etched into a glass substrate. The grating structure is patterned with holographic lithography on 8-inch diameter glass wafers, followed by reactive ion etching to form the grooves. An additional thin layer of TiO2 (thickness = 95nm), which acts as the guiding layer, is applied via sputter deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). The physical structure of the PC is designed such that low transmittance (&lt;0.5%) is achieved under resonant wavelength when the PC surface is submerged in aqueous solution. Besides the attenuation to the transmitted light, PCs also exhibit surface-confined electromagnetic standing waves with an evanescent field extending into the liquid media, where the field intensity is comparatively stronger than the incident electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). When nanoscopic scatterers travel within the enhanced electric field regions, they will experience an enhanced scattering cross-section; therefore, more photons are scattered and reach the imaging sensor. The resonant wavelength under this polarization is centered around 633 nm, overlapping with the laser illumination wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The PCs used in this work are fabricated by a commercial vendor to our design specifications (Moxtek, Orem, UT) and provided as 10.16 × 12.7 mm<sup>2</sup> chips. Each chip is subsequently cut with a dicing saw into four segments and mounted on microscope cover glass via ultra-violet curable adhesive for easier handling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Assay preparation</title><p id="P9">The PCs are cleaned by successively sonicating in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and water for 1 minute each and dried via compressed nitrogen. They are further dried in an oven (60°C) before oxygen plasma treatment at 500 mTorr under 200 W power for 10 minutes (Pico Plasma System, Diener Electronic). After the PCs are plasma-cleaned, they are placed face down on a holding fixture within a glass jar with 50 uL of 3-Glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) (Sigma Aldrich) at the bottom. The assembly is placed in a vacuum oven for 8 hours at 80°C to enable the GPTMS to enter the vapor phase, where the molecules can form covalent attachments with the exposed PC surface. After vapor-phase GPTMS coating, the PCs are removed from the oven and sonicated with methanol, toluene, and water for 1 minute each. For experiments performed to demonstrate the capture of exosomes with immobilized antibodies, instead of vapor-phase GPTMS, we performed liquid-phase silanization with 3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) (Sigma Aldrich), in which the PC was treated with 5% APTES in tetrahydrofuran solution for 1 hour, followed by a 10% dimethyl sulfide N,N’-Discuccinimidyl carbamate linker incubation for 45 minutes prior to antibody binding.</p><p id="P10">The five primary analytes in our experiments are AuNPs, HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 viruses, exosomes, and ferritin proteins. Each requires a slightly different immobilization procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). For the AuNPs, the silanized PC surfaces are functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) by incubating the PC in a 50 uM solution of amine-terminated ssDNA overnight. Complementary thiol-modified single-strand DNAs are conjugated to commercially available pre-activated AuNPs (10-40 nm, Cytodiagnostics) so that the nanoparticles will bind to the surface of the PCs. Pseudovirus capture follows a similar method; modified HD4 DNA aptamers (Integrated DNA Technologies) are fixed to the silanized PC surfaces by amine bonds, and these aptamers capture the HIV viruses via interactions with the GP120 protein on the outer shell of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The process for the capture of SARS-CoV-2 viruses resembles that of the HIV viruses, except AR-10 aptamers that selectively bind with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Integrated DNA Technologies) are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The exosomes (retrieved from mouse plasma) are captured by CD147 antibodies that are functionalized on the PC surface. No additional linkage is needed for the ferritin molecules since the covalent bonds that directly form between the silanized PC surface and the free amine groups on the ferritin provide a stable bond to hold them in place. A more detailed surface chemistry description can be found in the supplementary information, and the sequences of oligonucleotides are documented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Data processing algorithms</title><p id="P11">The algorithms for image processing and autofocusing are written in MATLAB (MathWorks) and LabVIEW (National Instruments), respectively. The image processing algorithm is detailed in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In brief, a rolling-window averaging method is applied to each frame to remove the constant background considering the dynamic measurements. The processed video shows the shot-noise-limited signals from the 3D movements of the nanoparticles (Video S1), rendering it ready for contrast signal recognition. A Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter is then applied to locate the local minima, followed by a 2D Gaussian function fitting for the point spread function. For each frame with identified particles, the algorithm calculates the contrast by dividing the signal by the pixel value obtained in the previous frame and then normalizing it. The contrast signal of a single detected particle in one frame is presented as one dot in the plot, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>.</p><p id="P12">A closed-loop system was built between the motorized stage and the focusing camera to implement the autofocus algorithm. The user sets the baseline and the tolerance for the peak position of the gaussian function on the camera line profile. Once a major focal dislocation occurs and the peak position falls out of the tolerance range, the algorithm will control the motorized stage to move responsively. A user-friendly interface is provided using the virtual instrument interface of LabVIEW, where the user can visualize and modify the CMOS camera line profile, set the parameters for autofocus, and manually control the motorized stage. A block diagram indicating the logic of the autofocus algorithm can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="results | discussion"><label>3</label><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S8"><label>3.1</label><title>Principle of imaging strategy</title><p id="P13">The imaging principle of the system resembles that of PRISM, and is fully described in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In short, the microscope is based on transmission iSCAT, where the transmitted light interferes with scattered light and forms interferometric signals at the imaging plane. Using PCs as sample substrates and illuminating them under resonant conditions, the system achieves three benefits: 1. Propagating leaky modes create evanescent fields that enhance the scattering cross-section. 2. Attenuated transmitted reference light increases the contrast detected by the camera. 3. Resonance-guided angular scattering increases the number of scattered photons collected by the imaging objective lens. The benefits brought by the PCs allow us to use air-spaced low-NA objective lenses, low-performance cameras, and Class 3 red laser sources for imaging purposes. The contrast signal calculated by the algorithm is positively correlated with the volume of the particle of interest and can be expressed as: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>Eqn. 1</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>α</italic> = 3<italic>ϵ<sub>m</sub>V</italic>(<italic>ϵ<sub>p</sub></italic> − <italic>ϵ<sub>m</sub></italic>)/(<italic>ϵ<sub>p</sub></italic> + <italic>ϵ<sub>m</sub></italic>) is the complex particle polarizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], <italic>E<sub>i</sub></italic> is the incident electric field magnitude, <italic>E<sub>r</sub></italic> is the referencing electric field magnitude, <italic>φ</italic> is the phase difference between the two fields, <italic>V</italic> is the particle volume, and <italic>ϵ<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>ϵ<sub>m</sub></italic> are the permittivities of the particle and the embedding medium. However, for our instrument, the linear relationship between the contrast and volume of our system is slightly compromised by the presence of localized surface electric field hot spots on the PCs due to the random capture sites. The enhancement of the scattering cross section also increases as the particle size shrinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], which yields another level of nonlinearity. Therefore, we do not seek to estimate the mass of the detected nano-objects through the magnitude of the image contrast. Rather, the system detects the presence of the analytes and provides an insight into their relative sizes, making this instrument ideal for the characterization of specific captured objects and their qualitative size ranges.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>3.2</label><title>Vibration isolation characterization</title><p id="P14">One major obstacle to scattering microscopes for clinical applications is the lack of a lightweight but effective vibration isolation method. An air-damped optical table is the most common choice for optical instruments; however, its lack of portability and large footprint make it unsuitable for many environments such as clinical diagnostic laboratories and biology laboratories. Novel vibration isolation methods, such as the use of magnetorheological elastomers as active dampers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], require careful design and meticulous care for long-term stability. Inspired by vibration isolation methods used for scanning tunneling microscopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], we sought to utilize the classical approach of using elastic bands as passive vibration dampers to meet our requirements. With the imaging system suspended by elastic bands, the noise caused by mechanical vibrations is insignificant and covered by photon shot noise and signals from out-of-plane nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The low background noise level in the differential image provides a large signal-to-noise ratio and facilitates the identification of the nano-objects. However, when the instrument is placed directly on an office table, the mechanical vibration saturates the pixel value range and overwhelms the AuNP signal on the differential image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), making it impossible to identify the nanoparticles. To quantitatively compare the vibration isolation methods, we measured the vibration of the optical assembly when it was sitting on an office desk (control), suspended by elastic bands, and placed on an air-damped optical table (CleanTop II, TMC) with a high-precision accelerometer (731A, Wilcoxon). We also measured the input acceleration (vibration) by placing the accelerometer near the legs of the office desk and the optical table, respectively. The temporal vibration data is Fourier transformed into the frequency domain and then divided by the input acceleration to calculate the transmissibility. The three datasets are triangularly smoothed to display the amplitude at different frequency ranges, namely 1-10 Hz (low), 10-100 Hz (medium), and 100-1000 Hz (high) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In comparison to the control group, the elastic band and the air table exhibit a relatively higher damping efficiency over the entire vibration spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>), except for extremely low frequencies less than 6 Hz. To produce a close resemblance to environments where human movements may cause additional mechanical vibrations, we stepped on the ground at a constant pace of 60 steps/min, one meter away from the instrument, simulating people walking in the immediate area. The experiment was repeated ten times, and the averaged result shows that the elastic suspension method has stronger resistance to footsteps in all frequency ranges, except for small disadvantages (0.7 dBV in magnitude) in the mid-range compared to the air table.

However, these products are either only compatible with their branded microscopes or too expensive to be considered in a point-of-use instrument application. The autofocus module we integrated with our scattering microscope is based on similar principles as the commercial products; the eccentric light beam that enters the back aperture of the objective lens reaches the sample at an oblique angle. This incident angle is larger than the critical angle, and all light is reflected to the imaging objective lens. A cylindrical lens then focuses the reflected beam to form a line pattern on the CMOS imaging sensor; meanwhile, a 1 × 3072 pixels linear profile is taken perpendicular to the line patterns for analysis. The reflected line pattern exhibits a quasi-Gaussian distribution, where its peak is used to locate the central position. Once a sample drift occurs, denoted as ± Δz, the peak position of the Gaussian distribution will shift accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consequently, the number of shifted pixels can be used to determine the magnitude of the focal drift and in what direction the sample stage must move to correct the focus. The distance that the line pattern shifts at the image plane can be expressed as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]: <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>Eqn. 2</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> where </mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mtext>=</mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P16">Where <italic>s</italic> is the offset distance to the optical axis, <italic>f<sub>cyl</sub></italic> is the focal length of the cylindrical lens, and <italic>f<sub>obj</sub></italic> is the focal length of the objective lens. The calculated <italic>α</italic> for our system is ~2000, which means that the focal shift is magnified 2000 times and translated onto the image sensor. With a 2.4 × 2.4 um<sup>2</sup> pixel size, the calculated resolution for the focal drift is around 1.2 nm. However, this limit is compromised by the sensor’s dark current, photon shot noise, and the piezoelectric sample stage due to its large step size (~1 um).</p><p id="P17">We investigated the performance of the autofocus module using captured 40 nm diameter AuNPs as targets and conducted tests on the temporal and spatial contrast signal change. Only one AuNP was present in the FOV, and a 10-second video was recorded every 5 minutes in a 60-minute interval for the temporal test. The result with autofocus disabled showed a consistent decrease in the contrast signal over time at an average rate of 1.86 × 10<sup>-4</sup> per minute, whereas the value with autofocus enabled is stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). To test the spatial dependence of the contrast signal with or without autofocus, we first manually focused on the center of the PC sample, and then move the FOV to the four corners. Without the autofocus being activated, all four corners showed degraded contrast signals at an average of 0.0159. In comparison, the autofocus-aided trials had a well-maintained contrast level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Finally, we dropped a 1 kg weight from 0.5 m above the table that held the imaging system to test the self-correction of the autofocus module after an artificial collision. While the autofocus module was able to recover the focal position, there is still a minor degradation of the contrast signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>3.4</label><title>System calibration with AuNPs</title><p id="P18">To characterize the size differentiation capability of the system, we detected AuNPs with diameters varying from 10 to 40 nm. A droplet of liquid (~ 5uL) that contains 100× diluted AuNPs (~1.5×10<sup>9</sup> particles/ml) is uniformly spread across the entire PC surface by clipping a cover glass on the top. Because of their plasmonic nature, AuNPs generally possess a larger scattering cross section compared to biological substances of the same size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], resulting in a higher contrast signal on the image. Scanning electron microscope images of the PC’s groove structures with false-colored AuNPs are shown in the first column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>. The second column corresponds to their processed images obtained with our scattering microscope. It can be observed that as the size gets smaller, the central lobe becomes fainter, as represented in a contrast signal plot against various particle sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, the AuNPs that we used as size calibration targets are free to move in all directions (Video. S1); therefore, the large standard deviation is a result of particles moving into and out of the focal plane and their relative distance to the PC surface. The trajectories of three uncaptured 40 nm AuNPs are traced in a 10-second video to indicate their free-floating nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> still proves that our imaging system can analytically compare the size of the nano-objects and that the diameter of the smallest free AuNPs that it can resolve is 10 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>3.5</label><title>Demonstration with various biological samples</title><p id="P19">In addition to AuNPs, we tested the imaging capability of our system with biological samples of clinical relevance, namely HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 viruses, ferritin proteins, and exosomes. HIV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are common analytes in medical labs because they can be found in the patient’s bodily fluid and are crucial to early-stage HIV and COVID-19 disease diagnostics. Ferritin is useful for this study because it has significant roles in preserving iron in vertebrates and it is a relatively large protein (~440 kDa) with a core consisting of up to 4000 iron atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Other studies based on iSCAT have targeted ferritin as a large protein and it was found to have a contrast signal commensurate with its mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Exosomes are clinically relevant because they could be potential biomarkers for cancer diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. As a subset of extracellular vesicles, exosomes are liposomal nanovesicles secreted by mammalian cells that range from 30-200 nm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. They are essential parts of intercell communications, carrying important substances, such as transmembrane proteins, mRNA, and miRNA, from the original cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Several aptamer-based biosensors have demonstrated the detection capability of exosomes, including fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], electrochemical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], and surface plasmon resonance methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. However, limited scientific literature reports the digital imaging of exosomes with variants of iSCAT up to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P20">All four types of particles were immobilized to the PC surface with methods described in section 2.3; consequently, their movements were insignificant compared to free particles. This greatly aided the tracking of small particles at low concentrations because it would not require continuous FOV shift to chase the particle’s movement. Among the four substances, ferritin has the lowest contrast signal, which is expected considering the molecular weight of these proteins. The comparatively small standard deviation of the ferritin contrast signals can be explained by the fact that they were directly bonded to the PC surface and minimal vertical movements occurred. The exosomes extracted from mouse plasma have an average diameter of ~100 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses are based on lentivirus cores, giving them approximately the same diameters (~150 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Contrary to their similar dimensions, the contrast signal of SARS-CoV-2 viruses is observed to be higher than that of HIV viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To explain this strange phenomenon, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding analysis on AR10 aptamers (selected against the entire SARS-CoV-2 viral particle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] and RBD-1C (selected against spike RBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The SPR results suggested that AR10 did not interacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and since the spike proteins are the only protruding proteins on the virion’s outer surface, we concluded that AR10 aptamer directly interacts with some moiety on the viral membrane. This brought the virions closer to the PC surface and thus the contrast signal is increased due to localized surface-enhanced electric field regions. We also investigated the enhancement of the scattered light by comparing the contrast signal of free and captured particles. Stronger signals are detected for immobilized particles because they are brought into closer proximity with the PC surface and experience a stronger field intensity. The contrast signal increases by 5.30 × 10<sup>-3</sup> on average for 40 nm AuNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and 3.75 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for HIV viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), proving that the surface-enhanced electric field areas created by the leaky guiding modes indeed improve scattering cross-sections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P21">In conclusion, a scattering microscope designed for point-of-use environments outside an optics laboratory was constructed, and its performance was tested. The autofocus module maintains a stable signal strength over time and spatial position, establishing a foundation for large-area scanning applications. The vibration isolation method using an elastic band suspension shows an overall better resistance to mechanical vibrations than an optical air table, creating new possibilities for portable and cost-effective microscope systems that are vibration sensitive. The imaging system is proven capable of differentiating a range of different-sized AuNPs and imaging clinically relevant substances such as proteins, exosomes, and virions at digital resolution. All the above experiments justify its performance in a point-of-use environment and ability to detect potentially relevant biological analytes. Future improvement can be made by honing the detection algorithm for live particle recognition and incorporating z-scanning to extract phase information for particle categorization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Efforts can also be made to minimize the system to a size comparable to a desktop computer for applications requiring additional portability. Expanding the application of iSCAT to settings such as clinical diagnostic facilities and biology laboratories opens the possibility for advanced point-of-care diagnostic systems, and this device is a promising step toward achieving that goal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS158544-supplement-Supplementary_material.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d92aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Lijun Rong and Dr. Laura Cooper for providing the pseudoviruses, and Prof. Marni Boppart and Dr. Ray Spradlin for providing the exosomes.

With the resonant condition satisfied, only 0.5% of light is transmitted and interferes with the enhanced scattering light, resulting in an interferometric signal on the imaging camera. The autofocus module also utilizes the same objective lens to form a total internal reflection of the 850 nm infrared light and senses the position of the sample.
