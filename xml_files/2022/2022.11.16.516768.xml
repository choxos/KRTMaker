Predictive circuits have been identified in wide-spread cortical regions. However, the contribution of subcortical areas, such as the hippocampus and amygdala in the formation of predictions remains under-explored. Here, we hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to predictability in sound sequences, while the amygdala would be sensitive to unexpected violations of auditory rules. We presented epileptic patients undergoing presurgical monitoring with standard and deviant sounds, in a predictable or unpredictable context. Onsets of auditory responses and unpredictable deviance effects were detected at earlier latencies in the temporal cortex compared to the amygdala and hippocampus. Deviance effects in 1-20 Hz local field potentials were detected in the lateral temporal cortex, irrespective of predictability. The amygdala showed stronger deviance responses in the unpredictable context. Additionally, low frequency deviance responses in the hippocampus (1-8 Hz) were observed in the predictable but not in the unpredictable context. Our results reveal a distributed cortical-subcortical network underlying the generation of auditory predictions, comprising temporal cortex and the hippocampus and amygdala, and suggest that the neural basis of sensory predictions and prediction error signals needs to be extended to subcortical regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>auditory predictions</kwd><kwd>deviance</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>intracranial EEG</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The human brain has an astonishing capacity in detecting patterns from the environment in a quick and automatic way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bar 2009</xref>).

Every time that a pattern is violated, an internal model of the world is updated through prediction error signals (PE), which quantify the difference between expected and received outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Heilbron and Chait 2018</xref>). One experimental testbed for studying sensory predictions is through auditory deviance paradigms. These paradigms comprise of series of commonly repeated (standard) sounds, which are occasionally replaced by deviant tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garrido et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Tivadar, Knight, and Tzovara 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Because of the difficulty in assessing electrophysiological activity in subcortical regions in a non-invasive way, the search for a sensory predictive network in the auditory modality has mainly focused on a 2-node circuit, including mainly the temporal lobe and prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garrido et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dürschmid et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosburg et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Canolty et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Phillips et al. 2016a</xref>). The most prevalent view is that sensory areas compute a low-level predictive signal, comparing current sensory input to the immediate past and detect violations of auditory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>). This 2-node temporal-to-prefrontal circuit underlying sensory predictions has been well characterized by non-invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Garrido et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chennu et al. 2013</xref>) and invasive electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosburg et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Phillips et al. 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Edwards et al. 2005</xref>), establishing a cortical hierarchy of auditory predictions.</p><p id="P4">Both the hippocampus and amygdala are sensitive to auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cusinato et al. 2022</xref>) and infrequent auditory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Halgren et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Knight 1996</xref>), but their specific role in the formation of auditory predictions remains unclear, as well as their integration with other cortical areas (E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al. 2020</xref>). Previous studies based on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) have shown that the hippocampus is sensitive to violations of expected events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kumaran and Maguire 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Garrido et al. 2015</xref>), mainly through low frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Garrido et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Recasens, Gross, and Uhlhaas 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the hippocampus is also sensitive to unexpected visual events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Axmacher et al. 2010</xref>), and memory functions (E.

Interestingly, invasive electrophysiology recordings in macaques showed that single unit activity in the amygdala is sensitive to deviant auditory stimuli, with comparable latencies to those of prefrontal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Camalier et al. 2019</xref>). Despite ample evidence for the involvement of the hippocampus and amygdala in detecting violations of environmental regularities, the specific function of each region in detecting deviant inputs and prediction remains underexplored.</p><p id="P6">Here, we aimed at shedding light on the role of the hippocampus and amygdala in detecting violations of auditory rules, and contrasting that to the well-established role of the temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosburg et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Edwards et al. 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that in addition to a cortical hierarchy in processing auditory events, there also exists a sub-cortical one, including the hippocampus and amygdala. To dissociate effects of deviance and predictability, we used a paradigm comprising of standard and deviant sounds, presented in a temporally predictable or unpredictable way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>). We recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in patients with epilepsy to directly assess neural activity of the hippocampus and amygdala.

Recordings took place at the University of California Irvine Medical Center, USA and at the University of Zurich (implantation), and the Swiss Epilepsy Center in Zurich (recordings), Switzerland. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study, approved by institutional ethics review boards of the University Hospital of Zurich (PB 2016–02055), UC Berkeley, and UC Irvine. All experiments were performed in accordance with the 6th Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Paradigm</title><p id="P8">Patients were presented with series of standard (80%) and deviant (20%) sounds. Sounds were pure tones, lasting 100 ms. The standard sounds’ pitch was drawn from a gaussian distribution with μ=500 Hz σ2 = 125 Hz. The pitch for deviant sounds was at the tail of the distribution with a frequency of 2000 Hz. Deviant sounds were presented in a temporally predictable (after 4 standards) or unpredictable (after 3-8 standards) context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The sound-to-sound interval was 600 ms. Sounds were presented in two blocks of 500 trials, one for the predictable and one for the unpredictable context, lasting approximately 5’ each. Two additional blocks were recorded, in which the pitch of the standard sounds was drawn from a distribution with high variance, but were not analyzed, as they were out of the scope of the present study. The order of blocks was randomized for each patient. Patients were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the sounds.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Acquisition and pre-processing of electrophysiological data</title><p id="P9">Intracranial EEG was recorded over arrays of depth electrodes, typically consisting of eight stainless contacts each (AD-Tech, electrode diameter: 3 mm, inter-contact spacing: 10 mm). Contact location was identified by co-registering a post-operative computed tomography scan (CT) with a pre-operative high resolution anatomical magnetic resonance image (MRI). By considering the most consistent localizations of contacts across all patients, we analysed responses within 3 regions of interest, covering the hippocampus, amygdala and temporal cortex (TC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Electrode localization</title><p id="P10">Electrodes were localized using merged post-operative computed tomography (CT) and pre-operative structural T1-weighted MRI scans. The CT scan was registered to the pre-operative MRIs, using a standard electrode localization procedure, implemented in Fieldtrip (Stolk et al. 2018). The electrode locations were visualized for each patient in native space, and their location was identified by a trained neurologist. To visualize the electrode locations across the group of patients, the aligned electrodes were warped onto a template brain in MNI space. For each patient, we retained for further analysis MTL electrodes which were localized in three different subregions (hippocampus / amygdala / temporal cortical areas).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p id="P11">All data were visually inspected by a neurologist (RTK) to (a) exclude electrodes that were within the seizure onset zone, and (b) exclude periods of epileptic activity in the remaining electrodes. Continuous data were notch filtered, down-sampled to 500 Hz and re-referenced to a bipolar montage, according to their nearest neighbor on the same depth, to remove any source of noise from the common reference signal, following recommendations in the analysis of iEEG data (Lachaux et al. 2012; Mercier et al. 2022). All electrodes were band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 20 Hz prior to the extraction of local field event related potentials.</p><p id="P12">Peri-stimulus epochs were then extracted, spanning from -100 ms before the sounds’ onset to 500 ms post-stimulus onset. All epochs were then visually inspected to exclude any remaining artifacts. Data processing was performed using MNE python (Gramfort et al. 2013). For analyzing local field potentials, epochs were baseline corrected with the mean of a pre-stimulus baseline (−100 to 0 ms), which was randomly chosen from the pool of baseline time points of all trials, based on 500 iterations, similar to previous work with iEEG data (Kam et al. 2019).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Responsive electrodes</title><p id="P13">As the electrode placement was driven by clinical criteria, we focused all analyses on electrodes that responded to the auditory stimulation. To not bias our search for deviance and predictability effects, we pulled all cleaned epochs together and sought electrodes that responded to all sounds irrespective of the sounds’ identity.</p><p id="P14">For each electrode, we contrasted the time-point by-time post-stimulus local field potentials with the mean of the pre-stimulus activity (−100 to 0 ms), using t-tests. The resulting t-values were corrected for multiple comparisons based on the false discovery rate (p&lt;0.05). Onsets of responsiveness were defined at the single electrode level, by considering the first time point that showed a significant response, while peaks by considering the location of the maximum absolute value among all significant t-values. Onset and peak latencies were contrasted at the group level, pulling all electrodes together across regions using linear mixed effect models, with a random intercept of patient to account for across-patient differences.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Deviance effects</title><p id="P15">Deviance effects were parametrized by F-values, which were computed for each electrode, and context based on a 1-way anova, with a factor of deviance, as in a previous studies using similar paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kam et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>). Onsets of deviance effects for each context were defined as the first time-point where significance was reached, assessed by comparing the true values to the distribution of effects obtained via 1000 random permutations in the labels of standard and deviant epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Group-level effects of predictability were identified by further contrasting the time-courses of F-values quantifying deviance effects for the predicable and unpredictable contexts, as in previous studies using a similar paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>). This approach is equivalent to a 2 by 2 Anova, and was preferred over a ‘classical’ implementation of a 2-factorial test, because of the bipolar reference in the data: as electrodes were re-referenced to their neighbors, a positive peak in one of them could deflect as a negative peak in the next, and close to zero on average. By parametrizing LFPs with F-values, the sign of LFP measures becomes irrelevant, and only information about the magnitude of effects is retained, making it possible to perform group-level analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Time-frequency analysis</title><p id="P17">For each responsive channel we decomposed the time course of LFPs in time-frequency representations, using Morlet wavelets with multi-taper windows (function tfr_array_multitaper from MNE), applied with 0.5 Hz steps.

Single-trial power was then averaged within experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Statistical contrasts</title><p id="P18">Statistical tests grouping data from multiple patients, for example testing for response onsets, were based on linear mixed effects models, with a random intercept for accounting for different patients, as it is common practice in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cusinato et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">E. L. Johnson et al. 2018</xref>). Bonferroni correction was used for correcting for multiple comparisons. For statistical tests performed in time frequency analyses of iEEG signals correction for multiple comparisons was achieved via cluster-based permutation tests (p&lt;0.05, 1000 permutations).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P19">Patients were presented with series of standard and deviant sounds (80% and 20% of the time, respectively). Deviant sounds were presented in a temporally predictable (i.e. always after five standard sounds), or unpredictable (after 3-8 standard sounds) context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were instructed to focus their attention to a silent movie and ignore the presented sounds.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Responsive electrodes</title><p id="P20">We first assessed electrodes that were responsive to all sounds, irrespective of context and deviance manipulations, by testing for significant changes in 1-20 Hz local field event related potentials (LF-ERPs) with respect to a 100 ms baseline period. Patients had consistent electrode implantations in the lateral and medial temporal lobe, covering the lateral temporal cortex and the hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref> for electrode coverage per patient and region). All three regions contained responsive electrodes to sounds across patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Electrodes in the temporal cortex showed a significantly earlier response onset than electrodes in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, F(1,43) = 8.08, p &lt; 0.05, linear mixed effects models accounting for different patients here and in the following), and an earlier response than electrodes in the hippocampus (F(1,45) = 4.06, p &lt; 0.05). The mean response onset across patients and electrodes was at 79 ms for the temporal cortex, 134 ms for the hippocampus and 154 ms for the amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P21">There was no significant difference between the onsets of the hippocampus and amygdala (F(1,18) = 0.12, p = 0.74). Response peaks showed a similar tendency as onsets, with peak responses occurring at 221 ms on average for temporal electrodes, and at 226 ms for hippocampal and 287 ms for amygdalar ones ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Deviance effects</title><p id="P22">Focusing on responsive electrodes, we then contrasted local field event related potentials (LF-ERPs) in response to standard vs. deviant sounds. As expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>), these showed a strong deviance response in temporal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> for exemplar LF-ERPs), and deviance responses for both the predictable and unpredictable contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c/d</xref> for exemplar responses). The deviance effects in amygdala and hippocampus are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. To quantify deviance effects at the group level, we parametrized LF-ERPs in response to standard vs. deviant sounds for each context, by F-values, which quantify the strength of deviance effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref> for group level deviancy effects). Group level results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> are visualized via F-values similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>), and not as LF-ERPs. Because a bipolar reference was used in the analysis, neighbor electrodes can have responses of opposing sign, and therefore averaging all LF-ERPs is not meaningful. F-values overcome this issue, as they quantify the strength of deviance effects across trials, irrespective of the sign of LF-ERPs responses. At the group level, the temporal cortex showed the strongest deviance effects for both predictable and unpredictable contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>, purple plots).

To this aim, to keep one consistent frequency band over time, we computed power in at 1-8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a</xref>). 1-8 Hz power in the hippocampus was significantly modulated by the order of sound presentation between 232 and 290 ms, and between 318 and 414 ms post sound onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a</xref>, horizontal lines, F(1,14) = 7.7.00, p&lt;0.01 at 260 ms). As a control analysis, there was no power modulation by auditory sequence neither in the amygdala (F &lt; 3.01, p&gt; 0.09), nor the temporal cortex (F &lt; 5.2, p &gt; 0.06).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Intracranial EEG recordings in humans provided direct evidence of subcortical contributions in the formation of auditory predictions. We found that the hippocampus and amygdala are sensitive to deviant sounds with distinct roles. Deviance effects in LF-ERPs in the hippocampus were stronger for the predictable compared to the unpredictable context, with an opposite pattern in in the amygdala showing enhanced responses for unpredictable deviance. By contrast, deviance effects in the temporal cortex were not modulated by predictability, in accordance to previous reports using a similar paradigm in a different group of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest the existence of a distributed network in the medial temporal lobe underlying sensory predictions: while the temporal cortex computes ‘low’ level predictions, comparing each sensory input to the immediate past, the hippocampus maintains a longer memory trace of auditory patterns, spanning over sequences of sounds, and is particularly active when a violation of the sequence can be predicted.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Subcortical network underlying auditory predictions</title><p id="P31">Our findings expand the network of deviance detection beyond a 2-node cortical network, which has been excessively studied using mainly non-invasive imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chennu et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garrido et al. 2009</xref>). Invasive EEG recordings have been used to confirm this 2-node network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dürschmid et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Phillips et al. 2016b</xref>), and have also demonstrated additional regions sensitive to deviance, including the insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blenkmann et al. 2019</xref>), the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Durschmid et al. 2016</xref>), the hippocampus and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Halgren et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Camalier et al. 2019</xref>). Here, we focused on the hippocampus and amygdala and showed that the latencies of processing deviant sounds in the amygdala follow that of the hippocampus and temporal cortex, suggesting a cortical-subcortical hierarchy in detecting auditory deviance. The fact that the amygdala responds to deviance at later latencies than the temporal cortex is in accordance with a recent monkey study using single unit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Camalier et al. 2019</xref>). Moreover, the hierarchy in auditory response latency observed in this study irrespective of deviance effects, fits the latencies of auditory responses reported in a recent study using a different auditory paradigm and patients, where the temporal cortex showed earlier responses compared to both the hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cusinato et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Importantly, our findings suggest that the amygdala is mainly sensitive to unexpected deviance, as indicated by a higher number of contacts showing deviance effects for an unpredictable compared to predictable context, and a stronger overall deviance effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings reinforce the role of the amygdala as a novelty detector (J. U. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blackford et al. 2010</xref>), or as being sensitive to events of high saliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fedele et al. 2020</xref>) which could be particularly relevant for cases of unpredictable deviance, as an unexpected change in the environmental statistics might signal danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balderston, Schultz, and Helmstetter 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P33">The sensitivity of the hippocampus to violations of sequences has been mainly examined in the context of ‘ oddball’ paradigms, in the auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ioannides et al. 1995</xref>) or somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hamada et al. 2004</xref>) modalities, where participants are asked to actively detect rare target stimuli in a stream of regularly repeated events. Our finding that the hippocampus is mainly sensitive to predictable deviant sounds fits with findings of previous studies which have shown hippocampal sensitivity to violations of predicted events. In the visual modality, the hippocampus has been found to be responsive to violations of an established sequence of events, rather than completely novel events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kumaran and Maguire 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen et al. 2013</xref>). Garrido and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Garrido et al. 2015</xref>) used a visual sequence of 4 objects, presented in a fixed, mismatch and unpredictable order in a MEG study. Using source reconstruction techniques, authors reported a higher theta power in the mismatch compared to the fixed or unpredictable conditions. Similar findings have also been reported in the auditory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Recasens, Gross, and Uhlhaas 2018</xref>), with additional evidence that hippocampal-to-cortical connectivity underlies the encoding of predictable sequences. Additionally, the hippocampus, together with the temporal and prefrontal cortex, were found to underlie the detection of predictable auditory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barascud et al. 2016</xref>). These results are in accord with our findings, as we show a significant increase in low frequency hippocampal power in response to predictable but not unpredictable violations of expected auditory events.</p><p id="P34">Overall, our findings suggest that low frequency hippocampal activity contributes to the detection of auditory sequences and formation of auditory predictions. Low frequency activity in the hippocampus has been previously shown to mediate memory (E. L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Johnson et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boran et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dimakopoulos et al. 2022</xref>) and predictions of future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sherman and Turk-Browne 2020</xref>). Our results expand the functions of low frequency hippocampal activity towards a role in maintaining an active model of environmental regularities.We found that the difference in hippocampal low frequency power between standard and deviant sounds increases the closer a sequence gets to a deviant sound, but only when the occurrence of a deviant sound can be predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). One interpretation for these findings is that the hippocampus plays an active role in updating an environmental model, keeping track of an ongoing sequence as it rapidly evolves across a sequence of auditory events. Similar findings have been reported for the prefrontal cortex, which has also been shown to be sensitive to ongoing auditory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dürschmid et al. 2018</xref>). Whether this tracking of auditory patterns is an inherent property of the hippocampus, or driven by external input, such as the prefrontal cortex, remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="P35">One main limitation of our study is the sparse electrode coverage: because of our primary goal to investigate hippocampal and amygdalar contributions in deviance detection and auditory predictions we focused on patients that had good coverage in the medial temporal lobe, with at least one hemisphere being seizure-free. As a consequence, in our patient cohort there were no patients with frontal depth electrodes or grids, which would have allowed investigation of hippocampal-amygdalo-prefrontal interactions. Future studies can profit from recent advances of high-precision MEG to reconstruct subcortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tzovara et al. 2019</xref>) and study how the medial temporal lobe network interacts with prefrontal regions. Another limitation of our study is that because of the tight timing in our experimental setup we were not able to assess metrics of functional connectivity among our three target regions, which typically rely on oscillatory coupling, that evolves over longer temporal intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dimakopoulos et al. 2022</xref>). Our findings on the timing of onsets and peaks auditory responses and deviance effects provide a first indication on the information flow in the amygdalo-hippocampal-temporal network, that can be confirmed using longer sound intervals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P36">We provide evidence for the existence of a subcortical hierarchy underlying auditory predictions. Our findings complement existing studies that have focused on the cortex and suggest that the search for sensory predictions and prediction error signals needs extension to subcortical regions. Importantly, our findings suggest the existence of a distributed network underlying the generation of auditory predictions, comprising cortical sensory areas, which compute a ‘low’ -level prediction, the amygdala, which is sensitive to unexpected violations of streams of sensory information, and the hippocampus, which computes auditory predictions through low frequency activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157277-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d93aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Interfaculty Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep: From Neurons to Health &amp; Mind” of the University of Bern (A.T.), the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant numbers 320030_188737, P300PA_174451 to A.T.), the Fondation Pierre Mercier pour la science (A.T.).

The amygdala (top row) showed a stronger deviance response for the unpredictable context compared to predictable one, while the hippocampus for the predictable context. By contrast, deviance responses in the cortex did not differ between the two contexts. Horizontal black lines highlight periods of significant difference in F-values for predictable vs. unpredictable contexts. B/C.

B.Mean power in the hippocampus as the auditory sequence unfolds, for the predictable minus unpredictable context. The mean power was computed for each contact via the mask of significant deviance effects in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), and showed a significant effect of sequence (F(1,14) = 7.87, p<sub>corr</sub> &lt; 0.05).
