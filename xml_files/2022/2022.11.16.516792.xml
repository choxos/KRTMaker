Human miRNAs act as central regulators of host-bacteria interactions. However, it is unknown whether human pathogenic bacteria could impede RNA silencing to promote virulence. Here, we show that the <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> type IV-secreted effector LegK1 suppresses siRNA- and miRNA-activities in human cells. This ability depends on its kinase activity and on a functional tryptophan-dependent Argonaute (Ago)-binding platform. We further show that the capacity of LegK1 to activate NF-κB signaling contributes to silencing suppression, demonstrating a link between effector-mediated NF-κB signaling activation and silencing suppression. LegK1 also promotes <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth in both amoeba and human macrophages, supporting a key role of this effector in virulence. In infected macrophages, the latter activity relies on the genetic targeting of human Ago4, highlighting a novel function of this host factor in antibacterial resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium, which infects and replicates in freshwater amoebae and ciliated protozoa in the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. When contaminated water droplets are inhaled by humans, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> incidentally infects lung alveolar macrophages, which can result in a severe form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup><italic>. L. pneumophila</italic> has evolved a type IV secretion system, referred to as the Dot/Icm system, to promote pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This secretion system translocates over 330 effectors into host cells and is essential for the replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in protozoan and in human macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. A significant proportion of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors resembles eukaryotic-like proteins or encode eukaryotic domains, and has likely been co-opted for subverting host functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Among them, the family of LegK proteins comprises proteins encoding eukaryotic-like kinase domains targeting specific host proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. For example, LegK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, as well as other IκB and NF-κB family members, resulting in a potent NF-κB signaling activation in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This effector contributes to the sustained Dot/Icm-dependent NF-κB signaling detected during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection of human alveolar macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it triggers the induction of anti-apoptotic and host cell survival genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which is thought to promote <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth in human macrophages.</p><p id="P4">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that post-transcriptionally regulate genes through the targeting of sequence complementary mRNA targets. In mammals, the miRNA biogenesis pathway involves the cleavage of primary miRNA transcripts by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex, which further releases hairpin-based miRNA precursors that are subsequently processed by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The resulting miRNA duplexes then bind to an Argonaute (Ago) protein, and one strand, the guide, remains associated to this silencing effector to form a miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The miRISC further directs silencing of mRNA targets through endonucleolytic cleavage (slicer activity), translational repression and/or mRNA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Four structurally conserved Ago proteins (Ago1-4) are encoded by the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Human Ago2 is the most characterized Ago member that possesses a slicer activity directed by a catalytic tetrad, DEDH (Asp-Glu-Asp-His), embedded in its PIWI domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This factor is the central component of the miRISC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, the phosphorylation of Ago2 at serine 387 triggers its binding to trinucleotide repeat containing 6 (TNRC6) proteins, which are tryptophan (W)-rich cofactors that associate with the PIWI domain of Ago2 through W-repeats (W-motifs) found in their N-terminal Ago-binding domains (ABDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. These molecular events are essential for High Molecular Weight (HMW)-miRISC assembly by recruiting downstream effector proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, including those involved in decapping (Decapping protein 1/2, DCP1/2), RNA unwinding (DEAD-Box RNA helicase 6, DDX6), and deadenylation (carbon catabolite repressor 4/ negative regulator of transcription, CCR4/NOT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, TNRC6 proteins use W-motifs embedded in their C-terminal silencing domains to directly bind CCR4-NOT and PAN2-PAN3 (poly(A)-specific ribonuclease 2) deadenylase complexes, thereby contributing to HMW-miRISC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This series of molecular events leads to the translational repression, destabilization and degradation of mRNA targets, and in turn regulates diverse biological processes, including development (<italic>e.g</italic>. neurological development), differentiation, stress signaling and antiviral responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Human Ago1 and Ago4 are slicer-deficient and thus trigger gene silencing through endonucleolytic-independent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. In contrast, human Ago3 retains a canonical DEDH catalytic tetrad and was recently shown to trigger RNA cleavage when loaded with specific guide miRNAs, in particular 14-nt 3’ end-shortened miRNA variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Although very little is known about the biological functions of these three Ago proteins, gene deletions of Ago1 and Ago3 have been retrieved in patients suffering from neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Furthermore, several biological functions have been ascribed to mammalian Ago4. This factor has been shown to (i) regulate meiotic entry and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in mice germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, (ii) translationally inhibit the second cistron of the <italic>CACNA1A</italic> locus in a miRNA-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the growth of neurons and Purkinje cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, (iii) interact with the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DNMT3A and in turn direct cytosine methylation of some mature miRNAs, which inhibits their functions and is associated with poor prognosis in glioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, (iv) mediate RNA-dependent DNA methylation in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, and (v) promote antiviral resistance in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, despite early assumptions that mammalian Ago proteins function redundantly, they can also exhibit very specialized functions.</p><p id="P5">Human miRNAs have been extensively studied in the context of host-bacteria interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. They regulate various cellular processes during bacterial infection, including innate immune responses, host cell cycle, cell death and survival pathways, autophagy, and cytoskeleton organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. For example, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> triggers the differential expression of 85 human miRNAs during infection of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Among them, miR146a was found up-regulated and required to restrict the growth of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in human macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a trio of down-regulated miRNAs, namely miR-125b, miR-221 and miR-579, was shown to target repressors of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> replication in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection is not only modulating the expression of human miRNAs, but <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is itself translocating active small RNAs (sRNAs) <italic>via</italic> extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the host cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Indeed, 15 sRNAs were identified that mimic human miRNAs and two of these, namely RsmY and tRNA-Phe, down-regulate selected sensor and regulator proteins of the host innate immune response in a miRNA-like manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, a recent study also shows that human airway cells make use of EVs to deliver let-7b-5p into <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and reprogram bacterial gene expression, thereby reducing biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Altogether, these studies, among many others, highlight a central role played by sRNAs in the reprogramming of both host and bacterial gene expression during infections.</p><p id="P6">Although the role of human miRNAs in host-bacteria interactions is now well-established, there is currently no evidence indicating that human pathogenic bacteria can interfere with RNA silencing as part of their virulence functions. This has, however, been previously characterized in a phytopathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> strain, which delivers several type III-secreted effectors into the host cell to suppress different steps of the Arabidopsis miRNA pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. It has also been extensively characterized in mammalian viruses that produce Viral Suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) to replicate in host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> type IV-secreted effector LegK1 acts as a <italic>bona fide</italic> Bacterial Suppressor of RNA silencing (BSR). We show that LegK1 efficiently suppresses siRNA- and miRNA- activities in human cells through both its kinase activity and a functional Ago-binding platform. We further demonstrate that the ability of LegK1 to activate NF-κB signaling contributes to silencing suppression. In addition, we found that LegK1 promotes <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth in both human macrophages and amoeba, supporting a virulence function of this effector in biologically relevant host cells. Importantly, the genetic targeting of human Ago4 by LegK1 was found required to promote <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth in macrophages. Therefore, besides identifying the first BSR from a pathogenic bacterium, this study unveils an unexpected link between effector-mediated NF-κB signaling activation and silencing suppression, as well as a novel function of human Ago4 in host-bacteria interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector LegK1 suppresses siRNA-directed silencing in human cells</title><p id="P7">The known Ago-binding function of W-motifs, present in some endogenous silencing factors as well as in some VSRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, prompted us to examine whether effectors from human pathogenic bacteria have also evolved such Ago-binding platforms to interfere with RNA silencing. To test this hypothesis, we retrieved the protein sequences from 25 genomes of pathogenic bacteria and used them to the Wsearch algorithm to search for putative W-motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a</xref>). The score of each W-motif was determined using the animal Bidirectional Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (BPSSM), generated from experimentally-verified Ago-binding proteins and their orthologous sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Among the candidate proteins exhibiting the highest W-score, we selected a subset of secreted virulence factors and tested their possible effects on the siRNA-based <italic>CXCR4</italic> reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1b</xref>). This reporter system relies on the co-transfection of two plasmids along with exogenous siRNAs targeting the 3’UTR of <italic>CXCR4</italic>. The first plasmid expresses the <italic>firefly luciferase</italic> fused to the 3’UTR of <italic>CXCR4</italic>, while the second one expresses the <italic>renilla luciferase</italic>, which served as a transfection control. We first showed that the silencing of the <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter was compromised in the <italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>ago1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>/<italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CRISPR/Cas9-based mutant HeLa cell lines, as revealed by an increased luminescence intensity compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c, d</xref>). In contrast, the silencing of the <italic>luciferase</italic> remained effective in <italic>ago1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>dicer</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c, d</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the <italic>CXCR4</italic> reporter system is dependent on Ago2, but not on Ago1. They also indicate that Dicer is not required for this process, which is consistent with the exogenous delivery of mature anti-<italic>CXCR4</italic> siRNAs. Significantly, when monitoring luminescence intensity in HeLa cells expressing individually these 8 candidate bacterial W-effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1e-g</xref>), we found that LegK1 from <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (strain Paris) was the sole effector capable of inhibiting the silencing of the <italic>CXCR4</italic> reporter, as found in <italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells or in cells expressing the VSR <italic>Hepatitis B virus</italic> HBx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1h, i</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that LegK1 suppresses the silencing of an Ago2-dependent siRNA-based reporter system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LegK1 suppresses siRNA- and miRNA-directed gene silencing through both its kinase activity and a predicted tryptophan-dependent Ago-binding platform</title><p id="P8">LegK1 is an experimentally validated Dot/Icm type IV-secreted effector possessing a eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Here, we additionally found that LegK1 contains a putative Ago-binding platform composed of four predicted W-motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1j</xref>). The tryptophan residues located at positions 41, 283 and 293 of the LegK1 protein sequence, namely W41, W283 and W293, displayed the highest W-score, and were thus selected for further analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1j</xref>). We first substituted each of these three tryptophans by phenylalanine (W&gt;F; LegK1-3WF). In parallel, we generated a K121A substitution in the LegK1 ATP-binding site (LegK1-KA), which has been previously shown to abolish the kinase activity of this effector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Both LegK1-3WF and LegK1-KA proteins accumulated to the same levels as wild-type (WT) LegK1 proteins in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that these mutated proteins are stable when expressed in human cells. We further analyzed their ability to suppress RNA silencing. To this end, we used a siRNA-based <italic>GFP</italic> reporter system, which relies on the co-transfection of a plasmid expressing the <italic>enhanced GFP (eGFP</italic>), together with <italic>anti-GFP</italic> siRNAs targeting a single site located in the 5’ region of the <italic>eGFP</italic> coding sequence. This siRNA-based reporter system has been previously used to characterize VSRs from different human pathogenic viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. We found that this reporter was robustly silenced by the anti-<italic>GFP</italic> siRNAs, as revealed by low accumulation of eGFP proteins when expressed in HeLa and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-e</xref>). In contrast, the eGFP protein accumulation was moderately increased in the <italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HeLa cell line expressing the anti-<italic>GFP</italic> siRNA duplexes, an effect which was found enhanced in the <italic>ago1<sup>-/-</sup>/ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). These results indicate that both Ago1 and Ago2 proteins direct the silencing of this reporter system. Of note, the fact that the reporter was not fully derepressed in <italic>ago1<sup>-/-</sup>/ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HeLa cells suggests that Ago3 and/or Ago4 must additionally contribute to its silencing. When the same analysis was conducted in HEK293T cells expressing LegK1, we found an efficient suppression of <italic>eGFP</italic> silencing, a process which was not observed in cells expressing the empty vector or the type III-secreted YopM effector from <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, which is deprived of silencing suppression activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). It is noteworthy that the silencing suppression effect mediated by LegK1 was even more pronounced than the one triggered by T6B, a TNRC6B-derived peptide containing multiple W-motifs, which was shown to disrupt the function of multiple Ago proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that LegK1 efficiently suppresses the silencing of an siRNA-based reporter controlled by multiple Ago proteins. Importantly, we found that the LegK1-3WF and LegK1-KA mutant versions no longer triggered silencing suppression of this siRNA-based GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Therefore, both the kinase activity and the putative Ago-binding platform of LegK1 are essential for the silencing suppression of this reporter.</p><p id="P9">To investigate whether LegK1 additionally suppress miRNA functions, we made use of a previously characterized <italic>GFP</italic>-based construct that contains two artificial miRNA precursors embedded in an intron sequence located upstream of the GFP coding sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. This construct produces two mature anti-<italic>GFP</italic> miRNAs, which are perfectly complementary to the <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. These artificial miRNAs were previously shown to trigger the self-silencing of the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter in a Drosha- and DGCR8-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Using this reporter system, we show that LegK1 triggers an increased GFP protein level compared to cells expressing the control effector YopM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f, g</xref>). This was, however, not the case in response to T6B, suggesting that the Ago-binding activity of this peptide does not sufficiently alter the function(s) of the Ago protein(s) that silence(s) this reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). Therefore, unlike T6B, LegK1 can suppress miRNA-directed silencing of this <italic>GFP</italic>-based reporter. In contrast, the GFP protein levels remained low in HEK293T cells expressing LegK1-KA and LegK1-3WF mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>), indicating that these mutants no longer suppress miRNA activity. Altogether, these data reveal that LegK1 can efficiently suppress siRNA- and miRNA-activities through both its kinase activity and a predicted W-dependent Ago-binding platform.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LegK1 interacts with RISC factors, including Ago2 and its PIWI domain</title><p id="P10">The presence of predicted W-motifs in the protein sequence of LegK1 and their relevance in silencing suppression, suggested that this effector could interact with human Ago proteins. To test this possibility, we expressed the Flag-tagged LegK1-WT, LegK1-KA and LegK1-3WF versions in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated their cellular partners. Using Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that Ago1, Ago2 and Ago4 proteins were recovered from Flag-LegK1 immunoprecipitates, which was not observed after immunoprecipitation of Flag-eGFP from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). This result indicates that LegK1 interacts with protein complexes containing Ago1, Ago2 and Ago4 proteins. Interestingly, we also recovered in the Flag-LegK1 immunoprecipitates the TNRC6A, PABPC1 and DDX6 proteins, which are well-characterized HMW-miRISC factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, suggesting that LegK1 interacts with mature Ago-RISCs engaged in RNA target repression. Importantly, the above interactions were maintained with the catalytic mutant LegK1-KA, while they were significantly reduced with the LegK1-3WF mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). These data suggest that the Ago-binding platform of LegK1 is required to interact with Ago-RISCs, while its kinase activity is dispensable for this process. Furthermore, we found that RNAse A treatment did not alter the ability of Flag-LegK1 to interact with GFP-Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). LegK1 thus interacts with human Ago2 in an RNA-independent manner.</p><p id="P11">We next investigated whether LegK1 directly interacts with human Ago2.

In parallel, we synthetized identical peptides where each tryptophan was substituted by phenylalanine, named F1, F2 and F3 mutant peptides. A pull-down experiment of each individual peptide was performed to elute bound proteins. Using this approach, we found that the W1 peptide did not bind to any of the Ago proteins, indicating that W41 is not a functional Ago-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, the W2 and W3 peptides exhibited a clear binding to human Ago1, Ago2, Ago3 and Ago4, but not to the negative control GAPDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b, c</xref>). Therefore, the W2 and W3 peptides can interact with the four Ago proteins. Interestingly, the binding to these Ago proteins was lost in the presence of the F2 peptide, providing evidence that the W283 residue is a functional Ago-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). The F3 mutant peptides remained, however, competent in interacting with the four Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). To assess whether the W293 residue is functional, we further synthesized a peptide carrying a substitution of the tryptophan residue into alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), a point mutation that has been the most extensively used on W-rich proteins to alter Ago-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.

To this end, we examined the possible impact of single and concomitant W-motif mutations on the ability of LegK1 to phosphorylate IκBα, a known substrate of this effector protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. More specifically, we expressed the WT or the mutant versions of LegK1 in HEK293T cells, and further incubated the immunoprecipitates from each cell lysate with purified recombinant CBP-IκBα-His<sub>6</sub>. Western blot analyses from these cell-free extracts, using an antibody recognizing phosphorylation at Ser-32 of IκBα, revealed strong LegK1-induced phosphorylation of CBP-IκBα-His<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). While the single LegK1-W283F and LegK1-W293F mutants triggered comparable phosphorylation levels at Ser-32 of IκBα, the LegK1-W293A mutant was partially compromised in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>).

These effects were similar to the ones detected with the LegK1-3WF and the LegK1-KA mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, the concomitant mutations in the two functional W-motifs of LegK1 are sufficient to abolish its catalytic activity.</p><p id="P15">We next assessed the possible impact of these W-motif mutations on the silencing suppression activity of LegK1 using the siRNA-based <italic>GFP</italic> reporter in HEK293T cells.

These effects were comparable to the ones observed in HEK293T cells expressing YopM, LegK1-3WF or LegK1-KA mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). We conclude that the W293 motif has a major role in LegK1-triggered silencing suppression and that both the W283 and W293 motifs must cooperatively orchestrate this process.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether LegK1 could phosphorylate human Ago2. Nevertheless, we did not observe any increase in the phosphorylation status of the human Ago2 protein in the presence of LegK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary text</xref>), indicating that LegK1 unlikely phosphorylate this host factor. Instead, these results suggest that LegK1 could suppress RNA silencing by phosphorylating other RISC component(s) and/or proteins that indirectly regulate RNA silencing activity. Because LegK1 has been shown to directly phosphorylate IκBα, resulting in a potent NF-κB signaling activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (Ge <italic>et al</italic>., 2009), and because its catalytic activity was found here to be essential for RNA silencing suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e, g</xref>), we further investigated whether LegK1-triggered NF-κB signaling activation could contribute to silencing suppression. For this purpose, we tested if the Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE), a well-established NF-κB signaling inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, could alter the ability of LegK1 to suppress silencing of the siRNA-based <italic>GFP</italic> reporter in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, while LegK1 triggered a significant derepression of siRNA-directed silencing of the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter compared to the control vector, we found that this effect was significantly reduced upon CAPE treatment, which concomitantly prevented LegK1-induced phosphorylation at Ser-32 of IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Of note, the low GFP protein accumulation detected in this condition was not due to a destabilization of the GFP in response to CAPE, because a normal GFP protein level was observed upon CAPE treatment of HEK293T cells expressing LegK1 and control siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). The CAPE-dependent suppression of NF-κB signaling can thus restore the ability of siRNAs to silence the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter in the presence of LegK1.

Based on the lack of NF-κB-related genes in amoebae genomes, and on the presence of canonical Ago proteins in these natural hosts, we propose that the ability of LegK1 to suppress Ago activities is likely the primary virulence function of this bacterial effector.</p><p id="P26">Antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) has been extensively characterized in plants, fungi, insects and worms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>. In mammals, emerging evidence indicates that antiviral RNAi also operates in embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and progenitor cells, in which the antiviral interferon (IFN) response –known to repress RNAi– is less active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, mouse Ago4 was also recently shown to restrict the replication of different viruses in IFN-competent cells, including <italic>influenza A virus</italic> (IAV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

In the present study, we unveiled a novel function of human Ago4 in host-bacterial interactions. We first showed that Ago4 –and Ago2 to a lesser extent– were the most expressed Ago genes in immune-related cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Significantly, although a normal growth of the <italic>Lpp</italic> WT strain was observed in human <italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>ago4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages, we found that the growth defect of the <italic>Lpp DlegK1</italic> mutant was partially rescued in Ago4-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This provides genetic evidence that LegK1 must suppress the function of Ago4 to promote growth of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in IFN-competent macrophages. These findings therefore extend the roles of human Ago4 to antibacterial defense. They are thus consistent with previous reports in plants showing that AGO1 and AGO2 proteins orchestrate antibacterial defense, beyond their well-described antiviral functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, this study reports on the first bacterial effector that directly suppresses RNA silencing by physically interacting with Ago proteins through W-motifs. Intriguingly, we have also retrieved W-motifs in an appropriate sequence context in effectors from various human pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). These observations suggest that a wide range of non-viral mammalian pathogens and parasites might have evolved an analogous mode of action to promote virulence. It will thus be interesting to establish if the discoveries made on LegK1 hold true for other virulence/parasitic factors from non-viral mammalian pathogens/parasites. It will also be worth developing innovative strategies to counteract this potentially widespread virulence mechanism in order to control infectious and parasitic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Human cell lines and culture</title><p id="P28">HeLa cells (ATCC® CCL-2™), control (CTL), <italic>ago1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>ago2<sup>-/-</sup>, ago1<sup>-/-</sup>/ago2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>dicer<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CRISPR/Cas9-based HeLa cell lines<sup>104</sup> (this study), and Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) cells (ATCC® CRL-3216™) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (containing 4.5 g/l of glucose) (Dominique Dutscher, L0103-500).
