In the EU, ~88,000 cases of human salmonellosis were reported in 2019 and 17.9% of all foodborne outbreaks were attributable to <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">ECDPC, 2021</xref>). The food products commonly associated with foodborne salmonellosis outbreaks were eggs, egg products, bakery products, pork and mixed food products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">ECDPC, 2021</xref>). Salmonellosis typically presents as a self-limiting gastroenteritis with diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and fever, usually occurring between 6 and 48 hours after ingestion of food and drink contaminated with <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Crum-Cianflone, 2008</xref>). The minimum infective dose can be between 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>10</sup> cells, depending on serovar, associated food type and individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McCullough and Eisele, 1951a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">McCullough and Eisele, 1951b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">McCullough and Eisele, 1951c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eisele and McCullough, 1951</xref>). In severe cases, individuals may be hospitalised if bloody diarrhoea or dehydration occurs, sometimes resulting in death in immunocompromised patients if not treated effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hardy, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Ancestors of the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> gained virulence factors required to invade epithelial cells and trigger an immune response associated with diarrhoeagenesis, shortly after divergence from the common ancestor with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baumler, 1997</xref>). Consequently, virtually all serovars can cause infection in people. Over 2600 serovars are defined for the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> but over half of human infections in the United Kingdom in 2019 were caused by strains of <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis or <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, and nearly two thirds were caused by strains of just ten serovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">UKHSA, 2021</xref>). The apparent difference in risk to food safety of serovars of the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> is likely due to a combination of factors, including the opportunity to enter the food chain and the ability to tolerate stresses to survive or replicate in the food chain. An important factor in the opportunity to enter the food chain is the host range of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> variant. Most non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> are considered broad host range, since they can circulate and cause disease in multiple hosts. Nonetheless, considerable host adaptation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars is evident from the unique complement with little overlap of serovars isolated from different livestock species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">APHA, 2021</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, including its monophasic variant, is unusual among <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars in its wide distribution in many livestock species and indeed wild mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Branchu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rabsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Extreme cases of host restriction may also play a role in the absence of some serovars from human infections. For example, <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum only circulates in poultry and is virulent in other species for reasons that are not fully understood. Other highly host adapted serovars such as <italic>S</italic>. Choleraesuis and <italic>S</italic>. Dublin that are adapted to circulation in pig and bovine hosts where they cause a more severe disseminated disease, can also cause disease in people, but these infections are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kingsley and Bäumler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Stevens and Kingsley, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A second factor that may affect risk to food safety is the ability of serovars to survive or replicate in the food chain. The ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to survive and replicate during stress enables <italic>Salmonella</italic> to persist in food and food processing environments. Stress may be defined as any physical, nutritional or chemical process which results in sub-lethally injured bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wesche <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Stresses include high and low temperature, desiccation, and chemical preservatives such as organic acids and salt. Desiccation is used as a food preservation technique to extend the shelf-life of products and these products typically have a low-water activity (a<sub>w</sub> &lt; 0.85), which is the ratio of water vapour pressure in a food product compared to the water vapour pressure of pure water at a specified temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Finn <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Labuza, 1980</xref>). Salt is also commonly used as a preservative and works by preventing bacterial growth through lowering the water activity of food. <italic>Salmonella</italic> survives osmotic stress by increasing the availability of intracellular solutes, which are then replaced by proline, trehalose and glycine betaine to initiate growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Koo and Booth, 1994</xref>). Thermal treatment, using water, steam, or thermal radiation, is one of the most effective methods of eliminating foodborne pathogens. During pasteurisation, a heat treatment of between 65°C and 95°C is applied to the food product to inactivate vegetative pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Silva and Gibbs, 2009</xref>). Exposure to high temperatures (&gt; 60°C) causes cytoplasmic ions to leak out of the cell, and irreversible damage to the cell membrane resulting in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ebrahimi <italic>et al</italic>.,2018</xref>). Low temperatures inhibit microbial growth by reducing membrane fluidity, and disrupting cellular processes, such as mRNA transcription and translation and triggers protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Phadtare, 2004</xref>). Weak organic acids such as lactic, acetic and citric acid are used as preservatives in food manufacturing and can be defined as organic compounds that retain acidic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sauer <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). They are normally bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, by diffusing through the cytoplasm and dissociating into protons and anions on exposure to the neutral pH inside the cell. Acidification constrains cellular functions due to inhibition of acid-sensitive enzymes such as those involved in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lambert and Stratford, 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Modern food manufacturing practices rarely rely on one form of preservation to inhibit microbial growth in food products, rather, a combination of multiple techniques are commonly used to provide robust protection against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Leistner, 2000</xref>). However, consumer demand for minimally processed food is increasing, and therefore understanding how pathogens behave under stress will aid in developing processing techniques which satisfy consumer interests for healthier products, without compromising food safety. To assess the effectiveness of preservation and exclusion of pathogens, typically, multiple <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains are used together in a strain cocktail to assess survival during food challenge tests, but certain strains possess an increased resistance to stress, thus posing a greater risk to food safety. Understanding strain variation will improve modelling of consumer risk of contamination of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in food products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Whiting and Golden, 2002</xref>) and improve selection of target strains for process validations, improved processing, and more reliable risk assessments. This study aims to evaluate the phenotypic variability amongst <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains in response to food chain related stress, and is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate multiple stresses on the same subset of strains, identifying key serovars with an increased resistance to food chain related stress.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Bacterial Strains and Culture</title><p id="P7">Fourteen <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> strains primarily isolated from food producing animals and food products were used in the present study.

An improved understanding of variation in stress tolerance of diverse <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotypes has the potential for improved risk assessment of processing techniques which satisfy consumer demand for minimally processed foods. Currently, strains of all <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars are treated the same in risk assessments, however our data is consistent with the view that strains differ in their risk to food safety should they enter ready-to-eat food or if the food is insufficiently cooked.</p><p id="P24">In this study we investigated the variation in tolerance to food chain related stresses for 14 strains from nine different serovars of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> with diverse epidemiology and risk to food safety. Ten of the strains were amongst the top ten serovars most frequently isolated from human infection in 2019 in the UK (Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Newport, Infantis and Kentucky) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">UKHSA, 2021</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis is generally associated with asymptomatic infection of poultry and eggs. Despite recent successful interventions that have resulted in a marked decrease in the incidence of <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis in poultry in the UK, this serotype remains the most frequently isolated from human infection, presumably due to imported food products or travel. <italic>S</italic>. Infantis and <italic>S</italic>. Kentucky are emerging threats in the poultry industry, with MDR strains emerging in the last 10-20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">EFSA and ECDC, 2017</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Kentucky remains relatively rare in the UK, but outbreaks have occurred in the continental Europe associated with an MDR ST198 clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hawkey <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Newport is a minority serovar isolated from pigs and poultry yet is relatively frequently isolated from human infection in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">UKHSA, 2021</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Kedougou is frequently isolated from UK poultry relative to other serovars, and although relatively rare in human infection, has caused several large outbreaks in multiple countries over the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">APHA, 2021</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Heidelberg and <italic>S</italic>. Schwarzengrund have been linked to poultry and been associated with outbreaks including dried pet food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Behravesh <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum is host restricted to poultry where it causes a severe disseminated infection called fowl typhoid. Occasional outbreaks in poultry flocks still occur in the high resource countries including the UK but is largely controlled by a test and cull programme. The epidemiology of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is unusual in its widespread distribution in zoonotic reservoirs. Most human infections are from broad host range variants, currently typified by the monophasic <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST34 clone that accounted for over half of all human <italic>S</italic>.

Some variants exhibit varied degree of host adaptation. For example, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium U288 emerged in pigs in the UK around the same time as monophasic <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST34 and despite accounting for similar proportions of pig isolates during this time, is relatively rarely associated with human infection. Significantly, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium U288 is more invasive in pigs and was present in the faeces in lower numbers than ST34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kirkwood <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium DT56 circulate in populations of passerine (song) birds where they are thought to cause a severe disseminated infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lawson <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).

Gallinarum that differed by less than 0.3% and five strains of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium by less than 0.05% sequence divergence. However, genetic distance had little relationship to differences on observed tolerance to stresses tested. For example, the <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum and <italic>S</italic>.

Typhimurium ST34 (S04698-09 and B54 Col9) differed by fewer than 20 SNPs in their entire genome and had similar tolerance to the stresses investigated.

Typhimurium strains S07676-03, S01960-05, B54 Col9, S04689-09 all showed a greater tolerance to refrigerated temperatures. A similar study in egg yolks reported that <italic>S</italic>. Infantis counts at 5.5°C decreased by about 1-log over a 4-week period, although this may be due to the presence of antimicrobial properties of the food matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lublin <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> is particularly problematic in low moisture foods such as dried fruit, peanut butter, and flour. Resistance to desiccation was variable amongst the 14 strains tested in the present study, consistent with a previous report of 37 strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in soybean meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Norberto <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In the current study, both <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain S01960-05 and <italic>S</italic>. Kentucky strain SL479 exhibited a lower tolerance. Tolerance to desiccation in U288 strains was also observed in a previous study whereby only 0.1% of cells of U288 strains remained viable after 24-hour desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>). In another study following <italic>Salmonella</italic> desiccation survival, <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis had the highest tolerance (80% ± 9%) and <italic>S</italic>. Newport had the lowest survival rate (36% ± 3%) during 22-hour desiccation in a 96-well plate, which disagrees with the results from the present study where the mean log ratio survival for <italic>S</italic>.

Newport strain SL254 were similar, suggesting that tolerance to desiccation may be strain specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gruzdev <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Sodium chloride and organic acids are commonly used as a preservative to prevent microbial growth in food products, due to their cost effectiveness and ease of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">El Baaboua <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), however our data suggests that <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains may be able to tolerate higher these chemicals to varying degrees and in some cases they may actually boost growth.</p><p id="P27">Notably, the strains that exhibit host adaptation tended to be the least tolerant to stress. <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum strain 287/91 was the most sensitive to inactivation by heat and cold storage in food matrix, and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain U288 S01960-05 exhibited a relative low tolerance to desiccation compared to other serovars tested. <italic>S</italic>. Newport strain SGSC4157 also exhibited low tolerance to cold storage but was relatively stable during heat inactivation. A <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium U288 strain was one of the least tolerant to heat inactivation and desiccation but was relatively stable during cold storage in food matrix. An exception to this trend was the relative tolerance to the stress conditions observed for a <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium DT56 strain, that are adapted to passerine (song) birds. Adaptation to a single host or reduced host range has been reported to be associated with loss of function mutations in genes involved in multicellular behaviour, a mode of living thought to contribute to survival in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">MacKenzie <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). For example, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST313 strains that are thought to be host adapted to an invasive lifestyle and have genomic signatures of host adaptation, have mutations affecting cellulose biosynthesis and catalase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">MacKenzie <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Singletary <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). A comparative analysis of <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum strain 287/91 and <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis strain P125109, revealed that <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum harbours 309 hypothetically disrupted coding sequences (HDCSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). These potential pseudogenes in 287/91 are responsible for loss of gene function in many metabolic pathways including, motility, metal/ drug resistance, amino acid catabolism and cellulose biosynthesis, and although not strictly related to the stresses included in this study, they could explain general sensitivity to environmental stress of <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum. For example, strain 287/91 has a mutation in <italic>bcsG</italic> which may affect cellulose production, and therefore a lack of cellulose production also affects the cells’ ability to form biofilm, rendering it more sensitive to chemical and mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Growth of the host adapted strain of <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum was also the most markedly retarded in the presence of 6% NaCl, 14mM citric acid and 12mM acetic acid. In contrast, growth of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium U288 was improved in the presence of these, although it should be noted that this strain grew poorly compared with all other strains tested in LB broth. The increased growth rate in the presence of 6% NaCl, 14mM citric acid and 12mM acetic acid was also observed for <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain ST4/74 and DT56. This is a similar finding to a previous study, in which an <italic>S</italic>.

The virulence of strains of this serovar is demonstrated by its link to notable outbreaks and the recent past and therefore its relative scarcity may be due to other factors that have not been explored.
