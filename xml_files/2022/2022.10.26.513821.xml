In this study, we use a ”double-drift stimulus” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi and Cavanagh (2015)</xref>; Shapiroet al. (2010); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tse and Hsieh (2006)</xref> to explore the processing of visual motion signals that underlie perception, pursuit, and saccade responses to a moving object. Participants were presented with peripheral moving apertures filled with noise that either drifted orthogonally to the aperture’s direction or had no net motion. Participants were asked to saccade to and track these targets with their gaze as soon as they appeared, and then to report their direction. In the trials with internal motion, the target disappeared at saccade onset so that the first 100 ms of the post-saccadic pursuit response was driven uniquely by peripheral information gathered before saccade onset. This provided independent measures of perceptual, pursuit, and saccadic responses to the double-drift stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. Our analysis revealed systematic differences between saccadic responses on one hand and perceptual and pursuit responses on the other. These differences are unlikely to be caused by differences in the processing of motion signals because saccade and pursuit appear to use a common motion processing mechanism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erkelens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fleuriet and Goffart, 2012</xref>). We conclude that our results are instead due to a difference in how the processing mechanisms underlying perception, pursuit, and saccades combine motor signals with target position. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dissociation in visual processing between perception and eye movements.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Visual motion serves multiple functions in visual perception, including object tracking, foreground-background segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Born et al.

We found that these processes are different. Participants were asked to make eye movements and judge the location of a moving stimulus whose perceived and physical direction of motion were dissociated, producing an error in the predictions of its future locations. The stimulus was a moving aperture containing a drifting pattern that moved along a direction 90°apart from the physical direction of displacement of the aperture (a double-drift stimulus). While perceptual judgments revealed the accumulation of a location error along the perceived (as opposed to physical) direction of motion over a long interval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kwon et al. (2015)</xref>, interceptive eye movements were much less influenced by the perceived motion direction and showed only a small, constant error that did not vary over time. We found that the perceived trajectory could be recovered from the distributions of saccade landing positions only when a delay was introduced between the presentation of the stimulus and the onset of the movement, so that saccadic responses were memory-guided rather than based on online visual input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Massendari et al. (2018)</xref>. This suggests that the visual information that allows the saccadic system to avoid the accumulation of position error must be short-lived, possibly related to the fast decay of neural activity observed in oculomotor structures after the disappearance of visual targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Edelman and Goldberg (2001)</xref>. Indeed, we found that the dissociation with perceived location was limited to interceptive saccades. Hand pointing movements, even when the pointing latency was matched to that of eye movements, revealed a systematic bias toward the perceived trajectory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lisi and Cavanagh (2017b)</xref>.</p><p id="P5">Saccades are not the only eye movements that differ from perception.

(2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Spering et al. (2011)</xref>. To compare motion estimates used in saccades, pursuit, and perception, we developed a novel experimental paradigm that allowed us to measure pursuit, perceptual, and saccadic responses to a peripheral double-drift stimulus simultaneously. Our results indicate that perceptual direction judgments and pursuit responses have a strong similarity, as they both display large deviations from the physical direction of the target. On the other hand, saccade landing positions show only a small bias, which suggests extrapolation along a direction closer to the physical direction of the target, or extrapolation along the perceived direction but for a shorter interval than the saccadic latency. Saccades and pursuit are usually interdependent and cooperate to track moving objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erkelens (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fleuriet and Goffart (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Goettker et al.

Thus, our results suggest that the dissociations between saccades and perceptual judgments in the localization of moving objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi and Cavanagh (2015)</xref> are not due to differences in the processing of motion signals but in how velocity information is used to extrapolate future target positions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P6">Eight subjects participated in the Experiment 1 (2 males, one the author and 6 females; age range 24-35), and four subjects in the Experiment 2 (2 males and 2 females; age range 32-38); all subjects were compensated 10€ per hour. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave their informed consent to perform the experiments. The study was conducted in accordance with French regulations and the requirements of the Helsinki convention. All participants had prior experience with psychophysical experiments and (except the author) were naïve to the specific purpose of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Setup</title><p id="P7">Participants sat in a quiet, dark room. We recorded the right-eye gaze position with an SR-Research Eyelink 1000 desktop mount, at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. In the Experiment 1 participants had their heads positioned on a chin rest, with adjustable forehead rest, at 180cm in front of a white projection screen. A PROPixx DLP LED projector placed behind the participants and above their head was used to project the stimuli onto the screen at 120Hz. The image projected onto the screen was 137.5cm wide (resolution 1280x720), covering ≈42degrees of visual angle (dva). The same setup was used in the Experiment 2, except that the chin rest was now placed at 120cm from the projection screen (which then covered ≈60dva), and the resolution of the image was 1600x900 (the stimuli were scaled to cover the same area in retinal space). An Apple computer running MATLAB (Mathworks) with the Psychophysics and Eyelink toolboxes controlled stimulus presentation and response collection in both experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Stimuli</title><p id="P8">Stimuli were noise patterns presented within a Gaussian contrast envelope moving at 12 dva/sec. The noise pattern within the envelope could either drift in a direction orthogonal to that of the envelope (double-drift stimulus), or vary randomly with no net motion (control stimulus). Doubledrift stimuli were generated by taking square snapshots from a 2D surface of 1/<italic>f</italic> luminance noise. In the Experiment 1 each snapshot was shifted 2 pixels from the previous one along a constant direction, resulting in a speed of ≈8 dva/sec. Control stimuli were generated by taking square 2D snapshots from a 3D volume of 1/<italic>f</italic> noise, with each snapshot shifted in depth by 1 pixel from the previous one (this value was chosen to match the perceived temporal frequency of the double-drift stimulus on the basis of preliminary tests; the results of the control task confirmed a posteriori that this value made the two stimuli perceptually similar when seen in the periphery). Since the 3D noise volume was anisotropic, the internal pattern in the control stimulus varied but did not contain any prevalent direction, and therefore differently from the double-drift stimulus it did not induce any systematic distortion of the motion direction. In the Experiment 2, doubledrift stimuli with different internal speeds were obtained by shifting the noise pattern by 1, 2 or 3 pixels (corresponding to ≈5, ≈10 and ≈15 dva/sec, respectively); control stimuli had also 3 different temporal rates, created by taking subsequent 2D snapshots in depth at half the rate of the double-drift stimulus (obtained by interpolating the noise pattern for distances of half pixel). Each snapshot was multiplied with a 2D Gaussian with SD set to 0.35 dva, and constituted 1 frame (w8.3 ms) of stimulus presentation. The noise patterns were generated randomly at the beginning of each trial.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="S7"><title>Experiment 1: main task</title><p id="P9">Each trial began when the participant’s gaze position was detected within a circular area of 2 dva of diameter centered on the fixation point (a black disk of 0.2dva of diameter) continuously for more than 200 ms consecutively. After a random interval (uniformly distributed within 600-1000 ms) the stimulus appeared at a random position, moving either toward or away from fixation at 12 dva/sec. The starting position of the target was defined on each trial by drawing a random angle (uniformly distributed in (0, 2n]) and adjusting the radius so that the target would (given its direction, inward vs. outward) reach an eccentricity of 8dva at the time of saccade landing. The expected time required by the participant to complete the saccade was estimated on every trial by summing the average saccade latency of the previous 20 trials (assuming a value of 200 ms for the first 20 trials) with the expected duration of the saccade, which we estimated as 36 ms. The duration was estimated according to the formula 23.6 + 2.94<italic>A</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abrams et al. (1989)</xref>, where <italic>A</italic> is the saccadic amplitude and assuming a 10% amplitude undershoot Becker (1989); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lisi et al. (2019)</xref>. The moving target appeared and immediately started moving and the participant was required to intercept it with a saccadic eye movement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Unbeknown to the participants on half of the trials the target was a double-drift stimulus (double-drift condition) whereas in the remaining half, randomly interleaved, the target was a control stimulus (control condition). In addition the different target stimulus (see Stimuli for details), the trial sequences of these two condition diverged after the saccade landing. On double-drift trials the target was removed during the saccade, and was replaced after 500ms by a black arrow (random orientation); in these trials the participants were asked to report the direction of motion of the moving target by adjusting the direction of the arrow with the mouse. Importantly, even though there was not target present after saccadic offset in these trials, and therefore no visual motion signals, we expected to find a short (≈ 100ms) post-saccadic pursuit response, corresponding to the open-loop response of the pursuit system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krauzlis and Lisberger (1994)</xref>, which must have been driven by pre-saccadic velocity information.</p><p id="P11">On control trials instead participants were not required to report the perceived direction. The target was a control stimulus (i.e. containing no internal motion, see Stimuli for details) that remained visible and continued moving after the saccade; participants were required to track the target with their gaze until it disappeared. The purpose of the control condition was mainly to provide a baseline for eye movement analyses (in particular for saccade analyses), and to avoid that repeated post-saccadic disappearances of the target resulted in an attenuation of the post-saccadic, open-loop pursuit response. Indeed, control and double-drift stimuli were designed to appear as similar as possible, such that participants would not realize that two qualitatively different types of stimuli were being presented. To test that this manipulation was successful, after the main task we revealed that there were two types of stimuli and measured participants’ ability to discriminate the two types of stimuli (see Experiment 1: control task for details).</p><p id="P12">The instrutions given to participants were to saccade and track the moving object with their gaze and that, if the object disappeared, they would have been required to report its direction of motion by adjusting an arrow. As mentioned in the Stimuli section, we designed control and doubledrift stimuli so that the perceived temporal rate of change of their internal textures was as similar as possible. Furthermore, we introduced random deviation in the trajectories of control stimuli to make them similar to the trajectories of double-drift stimuli. Indeed, although the trajectories of double-drift targets were always physically aligned on a radial direction with respect to fixation, the perceived trajectories were shifted toward the direction of the internal motion Kwon et al.(2015); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi and Cavanagh (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shapiro et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tse and Hsieh (2006)</xref>. In order to make the trajectories of control stimuli as similar as possible to the trajectories of double-drift stimuli, we introduced random shifts in their direction angle: specifically, we rotated them around the expected interception point (at 8 dva eccentricity) by either adding or subtracting (with equal probability) an random angle uniformly distributed within 15-35°(this range was defined to includes perceptual shifts observed in pilot tests with the same paradigm).</p><p id="P13">Trials in which participants blinked or moved their gaze from fixation before the appearance of the target were aborted and repeated within the same block. Each participant performed 2 sessions of the task, each comprising 400 trials split in 4 blocks. Participants were allowed to take a break whenever they felt the need. A standard 9 points calibration procedure for the eye movements was repeated after each break.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Experiment 1: control task</title><p id="P14">Given the short pre-saccadic stimulus presentation, it was difficult to distinguish between the two types of stimuli before the saccade. Indeed, after being debriefed, all the naive participants reported not having noticed any difference in the stimulus between the two trial types (that is between trials in which they should track the target after the saccade and trials where the stimulus disappeared after the saccade and they made a direction response). To make sure that the two condition were not distinguishable, we asked each participant to run a subsequent control experiment. We explained to the participants that in the previous task there were two different motion stimuli (control and double-drift) by showing static examples of each. Next we presented stimuli (generated with exactly the same procedure and parameters as in the main task), and asked them to maintain fixation and report, after the stimulus disappeared, whether the stimulus was a control or a double-drift stimulus (no saccade or pursuit required). The stimulus was presented for a variable duration, and after it disappeared two static examples of the stimuli were presented on the left and right side of fixation; participants provided the response by pressing either the left or the right arrow. The duration of the stimulus was adjusted online according to a weighted up-down staircase procedure that sought to find the duration of the target that yielded 75% correct responses. There were 4 independent staircase procedures, 2 for the inward direction and another 2 for the outward direction, starting at 100 ms and 800 ms of duration. The staircases were randomly interleaved, and each of them comprised 80 trials.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Experiment 2</title><p id="P15">Experiment 2 used the same procedure as the main task of Experiment 1, with the only difference that 3, randomly interleaved, internal speeds or temporal frequencies were used. Each participant performed 4 sessions of the task, each comprising 480 trials split in 8 blocks.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Analysis</title><p id="P16">In the main task of Experiment 1 and in Experiment 2, we analyzed perceptual response and eye movement data to give, for each trial, three independent measures of the effect of the internal motion (in the double-drift condition): one from saccade landing positions, the second from the direction of the post-saccadic pursuit, and the third one from the perceptual reports (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). For each of these measures, we computed the angular differences between the reported/estimated direction, and the direction of the displacement of the target. To obtain a measure of direction bias induced by the internal motion, we transformed these differences so that positive value would indicate a deviation from the physical direction (external motion) in the direction of the internal motion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Examples of the distributions of angles obtained are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.. 4A</xref> for two of the participants.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Deriving the saccade system’s estimate of stimulus speed and direction</title><p id="P17">Raw gaze position data were transformed to velocities and smoothed by using a moving average over 5 data samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Engbert and Kliegl (2003)</xref>; saccade onsets and offsets were detected using an algorithm based on 2D eye velocity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Engbert and Mergenthaler (2006)</xref>. Next, we estimated the direction of motion that was used by the saccadic system to intercept the target in double-drift condition. We computed a metric known as saccadic velocity compensation, SVC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Groh et al. (1997)</xref> by computing the difference between the spatial position of the saccade end point and the starting position of the target, and dividing it by the temporal interval from target onset until the end of the saccade. The SVC corresponds to the target velocity vector (speed and direction) for which the saccade would have been maximally accurate (i.e. for which the landing error would have been zero). The variability of this measure is mostly contributed by the typical scatter of saccade landing positions van Opstal and van Gisbergen (1989), but might also reflect eye tracker inaccuracies, direction estimation biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Krukowski and Stone (2005)</xref> or other systematic motor biases. To correct systematic biases and improve the accuracy of the estimated SVC, we calibrated our analysis using control trials, where there was no internal pattern motion to distort the direction that would be taken into account by the saccadic system. For each participant and direction condition (outward vs. inward), we fit a number of multivariate linear models, with the sine and cosine of the target direction angle as dependent variables. In all, we tested 32 different models; all of them included as a predictor in a trigonometric polynomial for the SVC direction angle (of degree 1 or 2, depending on the model), plus one or more of the following variables: direction of the saccade (also represented through a trigonometric polynomial of degree 1 or 2), with or without interaction with the SVC, and interactions between the SVC components and the saccadic latency or amplitude. These models correspond to a circular-circular regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jammalamadaka and SenGupta (2001)</xref> with multiple predictors. To avoid over-fitting, we evaluated the out-of-sample predictive performance of each of the 32 models through a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The best model selected according to this procedure is the one that is expected to generalize better to an independent dataset Geisser (1975), so we used it to estimate the target direction taken into account by the saccade system in the double-drift condition. The final model included as predictor the raw direction angle of the SVC vector in interaction with a trigonometric polynomial of degree 2 of the saccade direction angle. This latter component improved the fit of the model by accounting for saccade biases, which are known to vary as a function of saccade direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rolfs et al. (2010)</xref>. The average cross-validated error of the best model (measured in control trials) was 11.36°, about half of the average direction error of the raw SVC measure on the same trials, 20.03°.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Estimating post-saccadic pursuit direction and speed</title><p id="P18">Post-saccadic gaze position traces were low-pass filtered using a 100-points finite impulse response (FIR) filter with cut-off at 40Hz. We restricted the analysis to pursuit initiation, from 20 ms to 100 ms after the landing of the first interceptive saccade (we excluded the first 20 ms after saccade landing to prevent any contamination of our pursuit measures by potential inaccuracies in the identification of saccade offsets). This is within the time range of typical open loop pursuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krauzlis and Lisberger (1994)</xref>, implying that in this time interval post-saccadic visual signals have not yet had time to influence the ongoing pursuit. We fit these post-saccadic position traces with a line (orthogonal regression) to estimate the direction of the pursuit. Additionally, we differentiated these position traces to obtain a velocity trace, which we averaged over the whole 80 ms interval to get an estimate of the horizontal and vertical pursuit speeds. We took the Euclidean norm of this velocity vector as a measure of pursuit speed (irrespective of direction), which we used to compare the pursuit gain in the two conditions, control and double-drift (see Results). We used the same procedure to measure gaze velocity before the saccade, within an interval from 80 ms to 20 ms before saccade onset, to investigate whether we could detect pre-saccadic pursuit initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lindner and Ilg (2000)</xref> in our paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Perceptual estimate of stimulus direction</title><p id="P19">We took the direction of the arrow, as set by the participants in double-drift trials, as the perceptual estimates of target direction.

We then restricted the analysis to double-drift trials. We found that the direction of the pursuit was shifted on average by 25.76°(SD 3.74) from the physical direction of motion of the target, toward the direction of the internal motion.

Overall, the average direction of the pre-saccadic pursuit resulted roughly aligned with the external direction of the target envelope, in both the control and double-drift conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), however due to the small number of trials and the large variability it was not possible to determine whether the pre-saccadic pursuit was also significantly biased by the internal motion.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Perceptual similarity of control and double-drift stimuli</title><p id="P29">In the main experiment, the control trials, where the target remained after the saccade, were intermixed with the double-drift trials, where the target was absent after the saccade.

We presented moving apertures filled with noise that either drifted orthogonally to the aperture’s direction (a double-drift stimulus), or varied dynamically with no net motion. The first of these two, the double-drift stimulus, produces a remarkably robust perceptual deviation of direction of up to 45° or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi and Cavanagh (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shapiro et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tse and Hsieh (2006)</xref>. Using this stimulus we have previously showed a dissociation in the localization of moving objects between saccades and perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi and Cavanagh (2015)</xref>. This initial report however could not pinpoint whether the dissociation was due to how saccades and perception processed motion signals versus how they used them to extrapolate the position of the moving object. To address this question, in the current study we designed a novel protocol to measure and compare the effects of the illusion in perceptual judgments and two types of eye movements, saccades and pursuit with all three measured on each trial in which a double-drift stimulus was presented. The targets appeared in the periphery and moved either toward or away from fixation. Participants were asked to saccade to these targets as soon as they appeared, and then track them with their gaze. Participants were instructed that in some trials the target would disappear upon saccade landing, in which case they would have been required to report its direction using a directional arrow. In these trials, early post-saccadic pursuit (open loop) still occurred so that the effect of the pre-saccadic illusory direction was seen in the post saccadic pursuit, enabling a trial-by-trial comparison of perception, and pursuit responses. We also estimated the direction and velocity of target motion taken into account by the saccadic system from the saccade landing errors. The results showed that motion signals from the internal drift strongly affected not only the perceived target direction but also, with a similar magnitude, the direction of post-saccadic pursuit. In contrast, the effect on saccade landing positions appeared substantially smaller, less than half the shift observed in perception and in the pursuit traces.</p><p id="P36">In the Experiment 2, we varied the speed of the internal drift motion and observed changes in the direction of the pursuit, but not in its speed. This indicates that the oculomotor system combines the internal and external motion components of the double-drift stimulus according to some integration process that does not conform to either simple vector averaging or vector summation. Saccadic responses showed a similar pattern. We calculated the target speed estimated by the saccade system by observing the offset of the saccade landing from the initial position of the target (see Analysis section). The saccade system compensates for target motion during the delay of programming and execution of the saccade by extrapolating the landing along the direction of target motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fleuriet and Goffart (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fleuriet et al.

Previous studies have examined the effect of MT microstimulation on monkey’s oculomotor behavior during the tracking of a moving target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Groh et al. (1997)</xref> and found evidence for a vector averaging mechanism. In contrast, our results do not support vector averaging, suggesting that injecting a motion signal with MT microstimulation and injecting it with a drift within the moving target produce different effects. So even though the brain might not be able to tell apart motion signals generated by physical displacements and those generated by MT microstimulation, it can keep separate velocity estimates for internal (pattern drift) and external (object displacement), as postulated by a recent Bayesian object tracking model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kwon et al.

For example, sensory maps representing local motion measurements (i.e. monkey areas MT or V5) may be read out for separate tasks according to different algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Groh et al. (1997)</xref>. Indeed, some lines of evidence suggests that visual motion analysis can be specifically tailored for each function it serves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simoncini et al. (2012)</xref>, so that when confronted with the same motion stimulus, different responses, such as perception and eye movements, can reveal large differences in the estimated parameters (speed or direction) of the motion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Glasser and Tadin (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Spering and Gegenfurtner (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Spering et al.

However, we found here that another eye movement response, smooth pursuit, reveals estimates of motion direction that are virtually equivalent to those found for perceptual judgments (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Maechler et al. (2021)</xref>), suggesting that pursuit and perception use similar computation to estimate the velocity vector of the double-drift stimulus. One possible account of the current results therefore could be that saccade and pursuit are informed by different motion processing mechanisms. This however seems unlikely: previous research has consistently shown a tight relationship and cooperative interactions between saccades and pursuit during the tracking of moving targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erkelens(2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fleuriet and Goffart (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Goettker et al.

One possibility is that the saccadic system uses a similar velocity vector as perception and pursuit, but extrapolates target position for an interval shorter than the saccadic latency. Specifically, the direction bias measured from saccadic landing positions in our task could be consistent with an extrapolation of the target position along the direction of early pursuit for an interval of only about 110 ms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This temporal interval is smaller than the typical saccadic latency and approximately compatible with the so-called saccadic dead time, which is the short interval just before the onset of a saccade during which the system cannot make any more changes to the motor command <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Etchells et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lisi et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ludwig et al. (2007)</xref>. According to this account, the rapid programming of saccadic eye movements would limit the maximum temporal interval over which the position of the moving target needs to be extrapolated, yielding a smaller position error in the case of the double-drift stimulus. We propose that this could be the result of a dedicated oculomotor map that accumulates information and predicts ahead in time over a shorter interval than perception. In other words, the dissociation between saccadic responses and perceptual judgments would be at the stage where motion signals are integrated with position signals to extrapolate future positions and could be in the length of the temporal interval compensated by the extrapolation. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal that neural processing across the brain is organized in a hierarchy of temporal scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Heeger (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Murray et al.

Trial sequence in the double-drift condition. The red lines represent hypothetical gaze position traces, during and after the saccade. Even when the target was not displayed after the saccade landing, pursuit was initiated after the landing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krauzlis and Lisberger (1994)</xref>. The black line indicates the physical motion of the envelope on the display, the dashed arrows indicate the direction of the internal motion, and the green arrow the hypothetical perceived direction. At the end of the trial the participant reported the direction of the moving target. B. Trial sequence in the control condition. Here the target remained visible after the saccade and participants had to track it until it disappeared. These two conditions were randomly interleaved, and difficult to distinguish prior to the saccadic response (verified by a subsequent control condition). Participants were never asked to report the perceived direction of the target in control condition; the purpose of the control condition was to provide a baseline for eye movement analyses and, by providing post-saccadic vision of the moving target, to make pursuit a default response upon saccade landing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156294-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Example of eye movements traces (Experiment 1).</title><p>A. Example of a control trial: on the top panel the horizontal (red) and vertical (blue) gaze (continuous line) and target (dashed lines) positions are plotted as a function of time. The thicker parts of the gaze position traces indicate saccades. On the bottom panel, the same trial is represented in x-y screen coordinates: the dashed black line indicates the trajectory of the target (the small dot indicates the position of the target at saccade landing time) and grey lines indicate gaze position (the darker parts indicate saccades). In this trial the target moved inward from a peripheral position; the participant first intercepted it with a saccade and then tracked until it disappeared. The vertical grey square delimits the temporal window used for pursuit analysis (20-100 ms after saccade landing time). B-C. Examples of double-drift trials. Notice that the target disappeared after saccade onset, but nevertheless pursuit was initiated after the saccade landing. The dotted lines in the top panels, and the green arrow in the bottom panels represent the direction that the participant reported at the end of the trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156294-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Experiment 1, data analysis: post-saccadic pursuit traces.</title><p>A. The average speed of pursuit in the post-saccadic interval (20-100ms after saccade offset) was similar independently of the condition (control vs. double-drift) and thus independently of whether a moving target was actually displayed or not. Error bars indicate 95% CI. B. Computation of the direction bias. Each post-saccadic pursuit trace was rotated so that the real direction of motion of the target was at 0°and the direction of the internal motion was at 90°; the same convention was used for the analysis of the direction bias in perception and saccade landings. C. Raw post-saccadic gaze position traces from one participant (rotated according to the conventions illustrated in panel B); in the double-drift condition, the whole distribution of traces is pulled from the real direction of motion toward the direction of the internal drifting pattern.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156294-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Experiment 1: Results.</title><p>A.

Results of the control experiment. The duration threshold is the minimum duration of presentation required to reliably discriminate (75% correct discriminations) the double-drift stimuli from the control stimuli in the fixation condition. Notice that the thresholds are much longer than the presentation duration in the main experiment (max 600ms) indicating that participants would be at less than threshold discrimination levels in the main experiment. C. Direction biases for all 8 participants. Error bars represents bootstrapped 95% CI (percentile method). D. The size of the directional bias was not modulated by the latency of the movement for either saccade, pursuit, or perceptual responses (see text for details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156294-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: Results.</title><p>Direction bias in perception, saccade targeting and open-loop pursuit plotted as a function of the speed of the internal motion.
