While copulation and arousal increase are thought to be centrally regulated, ejaculation is a reflex controlled by a spinal circuit, whose activity is strongly inhibited by descending input from the brain, bearing no role on the regulation of sexual behavior up until the arousal threshold. However, this hypothesis remains untested. To tackle this problem, we combined genetic approaches with electrophysiological and behavioral analysis to functionally map the spinal circuit controlling the main muscle involved in sperm expulsion, the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM). We found that BSM motor neurons (BSMMNs) receive direct synaptic input from a group of galanin-expressing (Gal+) interneurons located in the upper lumbar spinal cord. Furthermore, the Gal+ population is progressively activated during sexual behavior and receives genital sensory input. Electrical and optogenetic activation of the Gal+ neurons evoked activity in BSM-MNs and BSM after spinalization. Interestingly, these effects were dependent on the behavioral state of the male and drastically decreased with repeated stimulation. Moreover, genetic ablation of the Gal+ neurons severely impacted the latency to ejaculate and the structure of the copulatory sequence. Taken together, our results imply an unexpected involvement of the spinal cord in the control of copulatory behavior, sexual arousal and in the post-ejaculatory refractory period, in addition to its well established role in ejaculation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphic abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS155684-f008"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>ejaculation</kwd><kwd>sexual behavior</kwd><kwd>bulbospongiosus muscle</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>circuit mapping.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Sex, albeit crucial for species survival and evolution, goes beyond reproduction: recreative and pleasurable sex is observed across taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Balcombe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Georgiadis, Kringelbach and Pfaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Zer-Krispil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and plays a pivotal role in the establishment of social bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cappelleri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In humans, sex can have additional effects on well-being, such as improvement of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Maunder, Schoemaker and Pruessner, 2017</xref>) or prevention of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Leitzmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, sexual dysfunction can lead to great distress in individuals and their sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carson and Gunn, 2006</xref>). Yet, despite the ubiquity of sex, its importance to well-being and its fundamental role in species survival, the mechanisms controlling sexual behavior remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Sexual behavior comprises copulatory actions, including direct genital stimulation, that progressively increase sexual arousal until the “ejaculatory threshold”: at this point, in mammals, penile insertion in the female’s reproductive organ triggers ejaculation and sperm ejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lucio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Ejaculation usually marks the endpoint of male sexual behavior, and is generally followed by a variable period of decreased male sexual activity, referred to as the post-ejaculatory refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lenschow and Lima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Valente, Marques and Lima, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Sexual behavior can be divided into two phases with apparently different neural control systems: (1) copulation and the accompanying arousal increase, and (2) the ejaculatory process itself. Copulation and arousal increase are thought to be centrally regulated, with the involvement of the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Allard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giuliano and Clement, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Corona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Ejaculation, in contrast, is a two-step reflex triggered by genital input and controlled by autonomic and somatic circuits located within the spinal cord. During the first step, called emission, sperm and seminal fluids are released and accumulated in the prostatic urethra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Newman, Reiss and Northup, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Sheu, Revenig and Hsiao, 2014</xref>). The second step, expulsion, is a somatic reflex caused by the activation of spinal motor neurons (MNs) and the associated contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM), a large, striated muscle surrounding the base of the penis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Sachs, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Peikert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P7">How copulatory sequences and arousal increase are coordinated, how the ejaculatory reflex is inhibited until the arousal threshold and, importantly, how the arrival to the arousal threshold is communicated to the spinal cord allowing the reflex to be triggered, remains unresolved. Important clues come from experiments in anesthetized male rats, where stimulation of the penis (via electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve) was shown to elicit ejaculation in spinalized animals, but not intact ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Marson and McKenna, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Pescatori <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). While this result suggests that genital stimulation can trigger the ejaculatory reflex per se, descending inhibitory signals to the spinal cord must modulate the impact of such incoming sensory input to prevent the inadvertent activation of the ejaculatory reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carro-Juárez and Rodríguez-Manzo, 2008</xref>), contributing to a view of the brain as a “spinal-reflex inhibitor“, in addition to a central organizer of sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Marson and McKenna, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Pescatori <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Normandin and Murphy, 2011</xref>). However, an integral question remains unanswered - what spinal circuit does the descending input modulate?</p><p id="P8">A key finding in the field stemmed from studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chéhensse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dobberfuhl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>): the identification of a group of galanin-expressing (Gal+) interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord that contact and drive the activity of BSM-MNs, the “spinal ejaculation generator” (SEG). Several lines of evidence support the decision to label the Gal+ population as a SEG. While electrical stimulation at the location of the putative SEG evokes ejaculation in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borgdorff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), its ablation results in complete disruption of the ejaculatory reflex, with no effect on copulatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the SEG seems to be anatomically connected to the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve, indicating that genital information might reach this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Larsson and Sodersten, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carro-Juárez and Rodríguez-Manzo, 2005</xref>). Thus, in this model, arrival at the ejaculatory threshold may be communicated to the spinal circuitry by the transient interruption of the descending inhibitory input, allowing genital stimulation to activate the SEG and the ejaculatory reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Allard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These studies also support the idea that the SEG has no role in the organization of copulation, as its ablation did not impair sexual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>). However, this working model remains incomplete, and in some cases controversial, in part because most studies were performed either in humans, where manipulations are limited, or in rats, with methods that have poor anatomical and cellular specificity, and/or low temporal resolution.</p><p id="P9">Here, we took advantage of the house mouse, a species whose sexual behavior consists of copulatory patterns that resemble human sexual dynamics, in particular with respect to repeated vaginal thrusting preceding ejaculation (in contrast to rat sexual behavior, where ejaculation is dependent on the execution of multiple individual penile insertions, spaced in time, each one with the potential of triggering ejaculation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dewsbury, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lenschow and Lima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Valente, Marques and Lima, 2021</xref>). To gain access to the spinal circuitry, we used the pelvic muscle controlling the last step of this complex behavior, the BSM, as a point of entry. Employing genetic-based strategies with high specificity (viruses combined with transgenic mice) and high temporal resolution (optogenetics and electrophysiology), we identified the mouse BSM-MNs, and subsequently their presynaptic partners, a group of Gal+ interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord. We show functional evidence that the Gal+ neurons receive genital sensory input and that their stimulation evokes dominant BSM activity, only after spinalization. Surprisingly, the evoked activity is dependent on the sexual arousal of the male prior to spinalization, indicating that the dynamics of the spinal cord circuitry controlling BSM activity also reflect the internal state of the animal. While Gal+ neurons seem to be active as soon as the male becomes sexually aroused, the genetic ablation of this population leads to profound impact on the copulatory length and structure. These results point towards an unexpected and more intricate role of the spinal cord during sex, beyond the relay of genital information and the control of the ejaculatory reflex.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Anatomical and functional characterization of bulbospongiosus muscle motor neurons (BSM-MNs)</title><p id="P10">In order to visualize the MNs involved in sperm expulsion, we used the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM) as an entry point to identify the corresponding spinal cord BSM motor neurons (BSM-MNs). Fluorogold (FG), a well established retrograde tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Köbbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), was injected into the BSM of adult mice (N = 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Serial rostrocaudal reconstruction of the spinal cords revealed a consistent distribution of FG-positive (FG+) BSM-MNs at the dorsomedial part of the ventral horn and close to the dorsal gray commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). FG+ somas were observed across several spinal segments, spanning from the lumbar 3 (L3) to the sacral 2 (S2) segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>), with the majority of cells located between L5 and S1 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Nearly all FG+ BSM-MNs expressed ChAT and VGLUT1 and 80% were osteopontin positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To activate the ChR2-expressing somas, a laminectomy was performed to allow blue light illumination of several BSM-MNs-containing spinal segments. To assess the specificity of the light stimulation, activity was recorded from both the BSM and a locomotor hindlimb muscle, the <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> (TA) (N = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). BSM EMG potentials were tightly locked to laser stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref> BSM trace, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). The largest amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), shorter latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>), and lowest light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>), were obtained with illumination above the L6 and S1 segments, in agreement with the BSMMN rostrocaudal density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).

To do so, we started by injecting the BSM of adult mice with pseudorabies virus (PRV, Kaplan strain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Strack and Loewy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boldogkoi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Saleeba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly to the FG and retro-AVV injections, PRV-labeled neurons were found primarily in the dorsomedial part of the ventral horn of the L6 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the rat, BSM-MNs were described to receive input from galanin (Gal+) expressing interneurons, referred to as the putative spinal ejaculation generator (SEG), located around the central canal in the lamina X of the L3/L4 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>). In agreement with these results, dense PRV labeling was observed around the central canal in the L2/3 spinal segments that overlapped with post-hoc immunohistochemical labeling of galanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), revealing the existence of a similar population of Gal+ cells in the mouse.</p><p id="P14">We took advantage of a mouse line where the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the Gal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2007</xref>) to specifically access this neuronal population. Gal-cre mice were crossed with the reporter mouse line carrying the gene for the red fluorescent protein TdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Madisen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) such that in the progeny the fluorescent protein is expressed in Gal+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining for galanin in the progeny from the Gal-cre x TdTomato cross confirmed the specificity of this mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). TdTomato-positive neurons were found along the rostral caudal axis of the spinal cord, namely in laminae X (around the central canal, N = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), with the highest density of cells present at the L2/3 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This location differs from the putative rat SEG, which was described at the L3/4 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>). However, the mouse Gal+ neurons expressed enkephalin, cholecystokinin, gastrin releasing peptide and substance P, similarly to the rat SEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nicholas, Zhang and Hokfelt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kozyrev, Lehman and Coolen, 2012</xref>) as all four peptides were present and overlapped with the Gal+ cells surrounding the central canal in the L2/3 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To determine if the results obtained with the PRV injections are due to the existence of a monosynaptic connection between the Gal+ cells and the BSM-MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Saleeba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), we took a two-pronged approach. First, we aimed to identify the location of the synaptic terminals of the lumbar Gal+ cells by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV carrying a GFP-tagged form of synaptophysin (a synaptic vesicle protein, present in neuronal terminals) into the L2/L3 spinal segments of Gal-cre x TdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, N = 7). To allow the visualization of BSMMNs, the mice were simultaneously injected with FG in the BSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). GFP-labeled terminals belonging to the Gal+ cells (green channel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) were found around FG+ BSMMNs (blue channel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) in all 7 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). On average, a total of 79% ± 2% FG+ labeled cells overlapped with synaptophysin-labeled terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>) indicating that the Gal+ neurons in the L2/3 spinal segments contact the BSM-MNs directly. Furthermore, this approach revealed other projection targets of the Gal+ cells, including the intermediolateral column (IML) and the central autonomic nucleus (CAN) in the lower thoracic and L1 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>), as well as the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). The IML and CAN are known to contain sympathetic preganglionic cells that provide sympathetic outflow mainly through the hypogastric and pelvic nerves to the visceral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hancock and Peveto, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Nadelhaft and McKenna, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Baron and Jänig, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Giuliano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The parasympathetic preganglionic cells clustered in the SPN at the S2-5 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>) innervate the pelvic organs, including the prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Orr and Marson, 1998</xref>), urethra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Vizzard <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and penis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Marson and Carson, 1999</xref>).

An optical fiber (0.5mm diameter) was placed close to the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>) in order to illuminate the terminals of the Gal+ cells. A total of 21 CTB-positive BSM-MNs were recorded in Gal-ChR2 pups (N = 7), out of which 18 reliably responded to laser illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J-M</xref>). Short laser pulses led to dominant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and/or action potentials in CTB-positive BSM-MNs (see upper traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>,M). Repeating laser stimulation after the superfusion of a high cation containing aCSF, to isolate monosynaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lenschow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), led to much smaller EPSPs in BSM-MNs (middle traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L,M</xref>). Blocking neural transmission via the pharmacological manipulation of NMDA (through AP5) and AMPA (through DNQX) receptors (lower traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L, M</xref>) abolished light-triggered EPSPs in BSM-MNs. CTB-negative large lumbar MNs (N = 16), in contrast to BSM-MNs, did not respond after laser illumination (1 out of 16 responded, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K, N</xref>). Taken together we present evidence for a population of Gal+ neurons present in the laminae X of the L2/3 spinal segments in mice, which is monosynaptically connected to BSM-MNs via glutamatergic transmission. Even though with different spatial distribution, this population shares similar molecular characteristics to the putative rat SEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nicholas, Zhang and Hokfelt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kozyrev, Lehman and Coolen, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To determine the involvement of the Gal+ cells during sex, we used the expression of the immediate early gene <italic>cFos</italic>, a routinely used molecular tool, to establish a link between behavior and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Krukoff, 1999</xref>). For that, we compared the induction of the cFos protein in the Gal+ neurons of the L2/3 spinal segments of male mice that ejaculated (sexual interaction with a receptive female until ejaculation, Ejaculation, N=6), with the induction that occured in males that were either alone in the cage (Cage control, N=7), or males with different degrees of sexual arousal (10 minutes with a receptive female and no penile insertion as mounting was interrupted whenever the male attempted copulation, Aroused, N=5; or five mounts with intravaginal thrusting, 5 Mounts, N=5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> A-D). To specifically quantify the number of Gal+ neurons active, we used the male progeny from the Gal-cre x TdTomato cross and performed post-hoc immunohistochemical quantification of the TdTomato signal and cFos induction in the L2/3 spinal segments for each condition. As expected, given its direct contact to the BSM-MNs, significantly more double positive neurons were found in the Ejaculation group, compared to the other three conditions (Cage control, p &lt; 0.0001, Aroused, p &lt; 0.001 and 5 Mounts, p&lt; 0.01 Student’s t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed similar levels of activation between the Aroused and 5 Mounts groups, and these two conditions exhibited significantly higher levels of double positive neurons when compared to the Cage control (p &lt; 0.01, Student’s t-test). These results indicate that the Gal+ cells are activated with sexual arousal and/or penile stimulation prior to the ejaculatory threshod, suggesting an involvement of this population in sexual behavior prior to and not just during ejaculation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Sensory input to the Gal+ neurons and the BSM-MNs</title><p id="P18">It has been hypothesized that once the ejaculatory threshold is reached, genital input can activate the SEG, triggering the ejaculatory reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Allard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This model is supported by anatomical evidence, as previous studies reported connection between the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve and the putative rat SEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Larsson and Sodersten, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carro-Juárez and Rodríguez-Manzo, 2005</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, functional connectivity has never been established. Therefore, next we investigated whether the BSM-MNs and Gal+ cells receive sensory feedback from the penis. We first replicated an experiment previously executed in rats in which the penis is stimulated electrically or through air puffs, in male mice that either were intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7A</xref>) or spinalized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7C</xref>) while monitoring the BSM activity in parallel through EMG. Similar to what was reported in the rat, we elicited prominent BSM EMG activity when stimulating (200Hz, 100 pulses, 6V; 5Hz, 3 x 5 pulses of 100ms, 6V) the penis in a spinalized preparation, while penile stimulation in the intact preparation led to scarce BSM activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7B, D</xref>). Penile stimulation triggered BSM responses were significantly larger in amplitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7E</xref>) and duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7F</xref>) in spinalized compared to the non-spinalized preparation, while the onset of BSM responses did not differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 7G</xref>). These experiments further support the existence of supraspinal inhibition onto the spinal circuitry, but still fail to address whether penile sensory information is indeed physiologically integrated at the level of Gal+ cells and BSM-MNs. To address this question we used an optogenetic approach and mapped light-induced local field potentials (LFP) of ChR2 infected BSM-MNs in the lumbar spinal cord of adult male mice combined with BSM-EMG recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A1</xref>). Prominent time-locked LFP deflections were observed when illuminating above the BSM-MNs-containing spinal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A2</xref>, blue trace, Vm) which were followed by BSM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A2</xref>, black trace, BSM EMG). Once having mapped the best location of laser induced BSM-MN LFP deflections and BSM EMG activity, the location of the glass pipette capturing LFP deflections was maintained while applying brief air puffs of 5Hz (10ms, 1bar) to the pulled-out penis, or leg as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A3</xref>). Air puff stimulations lead to larger LFP deflections when puffing the penis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A3</xref>, left panel, blue trace) compared to leg puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A3</xref>, middle panel, yellow trace) and this was consistent at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A3</xref>, right lower panel). Plotting the light-induced BSM-MNs LFPs versus the penis puff LFP deflections (blue) or the leg puff induced LFP activity (yellow) led to a higher correlation between the light-induced LFPs and the penis puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A3</xref>, right upper panel). These results hint to the BSM-MNs receiving sensory input from the penis. The same experiments were repeated in male mice that expressed ChR2 under the Gal promoter (GalChR2), as we mapped light induced LFP signals at the location of the Gal+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B1</xref>) while monitoring BSM activity in a spinalized preparation.

We subsequently performed penis air puff stimulations while keeping the LFP capturing pipette at the spot of best light-induced LFPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B1</xref>, right panel).

First, we performed electrical stimulations along the rostrocaudal lumbar spinal cord by inserting a tungsten electrode at different depths (550um - 850um), while measuring the activity of the BSM in parallel, via EMG recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) in sexually naive animals (SN, N = 8). We simultaneously monitored the activity of the TA leg muscle to evaluate the specificity of our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The location of the stimulating electrode was revealed by electrolytic lesions and immunohistochemical staining for galanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, upper panel).

Electrically triggered BSM responses were significantly higher and longer in spinalized compared to non-spinalized preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>) indicating descending inhibition from the brain, in agreement with our results from the mechanical/electrical stimulation of the penis experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and prior studies in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Marson and McKenna, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">1996</xref>). However, in contrast to what was observed in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borgdorff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), repeated electrical stimulations evoked decreased BSM responses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> Details; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; BSM 2nd and 3rd). Quantification of the EMG responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> &amp; F) revealed significantly larger and longer potentials during the first train of stimulation (mean amplitude 0.99mV +/- 3.6mV, 1st vs 2nd amplitude p = 0.04, 1st vs. 3rd amplitude p = 0.02; mean length 8.83ms +/- 1.4ms; 1st vs 2nd length p = 0.09, 1st vs. 3rd length p = 0.02; Mann-Whitney-U Test) when compared to the second (mean amplitude 0.5mV +/- 0.25mV; mean length 4.22s +/- 1.47s) and third trains (mean amplitude 0.06mV +/- 0.04mV; mean length 1.74s +/- 1.31s) of current application, while the onset of the responses did not change (mean onset of 1st 3.9 +/- 1.83s, mean onset of 2nd 6.03 +/- 3.02s, mean onset 3rd 0.54 +/- 0.13s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Moreover, we did not observe the expulsion of sperm or seminal fluid during any of our experiments in mice. Therefore, to rule out the hypothesis that the lack of sperm emission in mice was due to a technical issue, we reproduced the experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borgdorff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref> in anesthetized rats.

We wondered if our inability to elicit stable BSM activity with repeated electrical stimulations in the mouse was related to the state of the male/refractory period. To test this hypothesis we allowed male mice to have sex prior to electrical stimulation experiments. One group had sex until reaching ejaculation (Ejaculation, N = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref> upper panel), while another group of males was allowed to perform 5 mounts with intravaginal thrusting (5 Mounts, N = 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref> upper panel). Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord of a male mouse from the Ejaculation group evoked less BSM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>, lower panel) compared to the BSM activity elicited in the Sexually naive group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, first train of stimulation), and to the BSM activity elicited in a male from the 5 Mounts group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>, lower panel). While the mean amplitude of the BSM activity was significantly higher in the 5 Mounts group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>), the duration of the BSM activity was significantly shorter in the Ejaculation group, when compared to the other two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>). Even though there was no difference in the mean amplitude of the BSM events between Sexually naive and the Ejaculation groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>), the number of events was significantly lower in the Ejaculation group compared to the other two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>), further suggesting that after ejaculation electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is not capable of eliciting high activity in the BSM. Taken together, these experiments suggest that electrical stimulation of the mouse spinal cord in the area where the Gal+ neurons were identified, and contrary to the findings observed in the rat, is only able to evoke the second and last phase of the ejaculatory process (expulsion), lacking the power to elicit emission. The internal state-dependent outcome of the electrical stimulations (Sexually naive vs. 5 Mounts vs. Ejaculation) implies that the properties of the neuronal circuits in this region of the spinal cord are modulated by copulation and ejaculation, suggesting that the spinal circuitry might be involved in the control of sexual behavior (corroborating the results from the cFos experiment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and the refractory period in addition to ejaculation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Optogenetic stimulation of the lumbar Gal+ neurons leads to BSM activity</title><p id="P22">As electric stimulation experiments inherently lack specificity, to unequivocally establish a link between the activity of the Gal+ cells, BSM-MNs and the BSM, we genetically restricted the neuronal population being stimulated to the Gal+ neurons, by crossing the Gal-cre mouse line with the ChR2 reporter line (Gal-ChR2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Madisen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). To activate the Gal+ neurons we placed an optical fiber on top of the spinal cord and delivered brief pulses of blue light along its rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panel, N = 13).

As expected, BSM activity was only observed in response to illumination restricted to the location with the highest ChR2 expression (revealed by either DiI injections or an electrolytic lesion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>), namely above the L2/3 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), the region previously shown to harbor the highest density of Gal+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Corroborating the results obtained with electric stimulations, optogenetically-evoked BSM responses were markedly higher in amplitude and longer in a spinalized compared to an intact preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>) further supporting the idea that the Gal+ cells may be held under tonic descending inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Marson and McKenna, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Pescatori <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Normandin and Murphy, 2011</xref>).

As described above, and in contrast to the optogenetic activation of Gal+ neurons, the optogenetic activation of BSM-MNs evoked stable BSM responses across repeated rounds of illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6N-P</xref>), suggesting that the depression of the BSM activity might be due to an alteration in the synaptic transmission between the Gal+ and BSMMNs, and not changes in the properties of BSM-MNs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Genetic ablation of lumbar Gal+ neurons disrupts copulatory behavior and arousal build up</title><p id="P23">So far our results suggest that in addition to its role in sperm expulsion, the population of lumbar Gal+ cells might also be involved in copulation.

A conditional AAV carrying the construct for DTR (AA8V-FLEX-DTR-GFP, Salk) was injected in the L2/3 spinal segments of sexually trained males derived from the Gal-Cre x TdTomato cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>; DTR group; N = 12). The control group, of the same genotype and also sexually trained, underwent a sham surgery at the same spinal location (SHAM group; N = 7). After a recovery time and a second session of sexual behavior, both groups (DTR and SHAM) received an intraperitoneal injection of dipheteria toxin (DT). One week after the DT treatment, the effect of the genetic ablation on sexual behavior was tested in the presence of a sexually receptive female. Males of both groups were sacrificed either 90 minutes after ejaculation or 90 minutes after the female was placed inside the testing arena, in cases where the male initiated attempts of copulation but did not ejaculate. In the case of absence of sexual arousal (no display of mount attempts), the trial was interrupted 30 minutes after female in and testing was repeated up to two more times, once a week (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 14A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for detailed experimental procedure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Valente, Marques and Lima, 2021</xref>). After post-hoc immunohistochemical processing of the spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B &amp; C</xref>), the numbers of cFos positive and Gal+ neurons (visualized via the tdTomato protein) in the L2/3 spinal segments were checked. While the number of cFos-positive cells was comparable between the SHAM and DTR group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-D</xref>), a significant reduction in the number of Gal+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E &amp; G</xref>) and in the overlap of Gal+ neurons and cFos cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F &amp; G</xref>). In agreement with the previous cFos and electrical stimulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and further supporting the involvement of these neurons in a more general control of sexual behavior, the copulatrory sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>) was strongly affected in the DTR group. While 3 out of 12 DTR animals did not reach ejaculation (but attempted copulation) and only one ejaculated in less than 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>, lower panel), all SHAM animals reached ejaculation, and only two took longer than 10 minutes to reach ejaculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>, upper panel). Individual raster plots for each animal aligned to the first consummatory act (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7J</xref>) illustrate no effect on the latency to mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7K</xref>), while the latency to ejaculate from first mount was longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7L</xref>). In order to determine which aspect of the sexual interaction was disrupted, leading to the increase in the latency to ejaculate, we further scrutinized the copulatory sequence, starting with the mounting events that resulted in penile insertion (Mount with thrusting, MT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>), which had similar duration across the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 14B</xref>). The number of MT was also similar across the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7N</xref>) indicating that a similar amount of genital sensory information was sufficient to trigger ejaculation in both types of males, despite the difference in the latency to ejaculate. In contrast, we observed a difference in the number of mounts that did not result in penile insertion: mount attempts where the male performed several shallow pelvic thrust movements trying to locate the female’s vagina (which only occur if sexually aroused, Mounts with probing, MP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7O</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">McGill, 1962</xref>). Surprisingly, the ejaculation duration was similar for all males that ejaculated (from the last thrust until the male dismounted the female, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7P</xref>), indicating that if the male reached the arousal threshold, the ejaculatory reflex could be triggered. This is in marked contrast to the results obtained when the Gal+ expressing neurons of the rat, the SEG, were ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>). In line with the increased number of MP, the time it took to the first successful penile insertion after the male placed his paws on the female flanks was also significantly longer in the DTR group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 14C</xref>). Finally, we observed that the thrusting rate and the dynamics of the MT were similar across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7R-T</xref>) indicating that once penile insertion was achieved, pelvic thrusting was normal. Taken together, our results indicate that the ablation of the lumbar Gal+ population leads to an increase in the latency to ejaculate and a profound disruption of the copulatory sequence, supporting a more complex involvement of the spinal cord in the control of sexual behavior in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Ejaculation has been described as a spinal reflex. This classification entails that the brain plays no part in its execution, but also that the activity of its spinal network is inconsequential to any other behavior, except ejaculation. This dualistic view of the nervous system has been repeatedly challenged, in particular by the existence of some neurological disorders that strongly suggested that the network of spinal neurons should be incorporated into the control system, where central and effector players are in a continuous exchange of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Guertin, 2013</xref>). With this study we bring new evidence corroborating this non-dualistic view, namely in the integration of sensory cues and arousal state in order to ultimately induce ejaculation. Using the penile muscle involved in sperm expulsion as a point of entry, we have characterized a microcircuit in the lumbar spinal cord of male mice consisting of motor neurons innervating the BSM (BSM-MNs) and a galanin-positive (Gal+) cell population that monosynaptically contacts the BSM-MNs, receives sensory input from the penis, controls expulsion and modulates sexual behaviour.</p><p id="P25">Despite some differences in the identity of the spinal segments harboring the Gal+ neurons (L2/3 segments versus L3/4 in the rat; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>), the population described in our study has a similar molecular profile to the previously identified rat Spinal Ejaculator Generator (SEG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nicholas, Zhang and Hokfelt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Coolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kozyrev, Lehman and Coolen, 2012</xref>).

Indeed, besides its direct output to the BSM-MNs, it has been suggested that the Gal+ neurons must also provide input to autonomic centers involved in ejaculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Marson, Platt and McKenna, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Orr and Marson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gerendai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2003</xref>), and other pelvic floor muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Marson and McKenna, 1996</xref>). Our viral experiments provide strong anatomical evidence for a reciprocal connection between the Gal+ neurons and autonomic nuclei, in addition to the ischiocavernosus MNs, thereby suggesting a potential impact not only in the regulation of emission, but also erection. The output to the ischiocavernosus MNs might be important for the regulation of penile tumescence, which must be finely regulated at the time of ejaculation, as pressure has to momentarily decrease for expulsion to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">El-Sakka and Lue, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Electrically induced ejaculation in anesthetized rats was shown to result in very similar motor and physiological activity patterns regardless of an intact connection to the brain (which we reproduced in our study), but penile stimulation can activate ejaculation only in anesthetized spinalized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Pescatori <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). These results suggested the existence of descending inhibition gating the sensory input from the penis, but that the rat SEG can function independently of the brain once inhibition is removed. We observed something different in the mouse: pronounced BSM activity was only triggered when the Gal+ cells were electrically activated in a spinalized preparation, but not if the connection to the brain was intact. Moreover, penile stimulation in our hands not only was unable to trigger an ejaculation, but also the BSM-induced activity was much smaller than the one observed in a spinalized preparation. Therefore, our results support a model where, at least in the mouse, the Gal+ population and the incoming sensory input is kept under a massive inhibition from the brain, most likely from the ipsilateral paragigantocellular thalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Marson and McKenna, 1990</xref>), until the ejaculatory threshold is reached.</p><p id="P27">We were obviously intrigued by the fact that we could not trigger emission in the mouse with Gal+ and penile stimulation, even though we demonstrated an anatomical connection to autonomic centers, the main players in the emission process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kolbeck and Steers, 1992</xref>). While we cannot completely exclude that the failure to trigger emission is due to our inability to find the appropriate stimulation parameters, we would like to propose that these results are biologically plausible and might actually reflect species differences in the regulation of ejaculation. The mouse copulation pattern, as initially stated, is much similar to the human, marked by repeated vaginal thrusting leading to one ejaculation, but quite divergent from rat sexual behavior during which multiple ejaculations are dependent on the execution of individual penile insertions. The arousal build up in the rat may differ from mice and humans, as it might be independent or much less influenced by genital sensory input, while in the mouse, sensory integration of multiple thrusts is crucial. While the rat results suggest that the descending inhibition only operates at the level of the SEG, our data points for the descending inhibition to modulate the Gal+ neurons and the incoming sensory input to them. The anatomical circuitry seems to be similar in rats and mice, however, the mechanisms by which these circuits operate must be fundamentally different, with the rat spinal circuitry being a “real spinal reflex arc”, capable of driving ejaculation with a sensory stimulus, if disconnected from the brain. In contrast, the mouse circuit does not qualify as a proper reflex, as the sensory input is not able to drive emission, nor full blown BSM activity, supporting a constant dialogue between the brain and the spinal cord, for arousal build up and ejaculation. Future comparative experimental efforts should be undertaken to reveal the logic of operation of the hardware in these two different species. The discrepancies outlined in this study may result from different modus operandi, the product of different evolutionary histories.</p><p id="P28">We observed an unexpected gradual increase in the activity of the Gal+ population with sexual behavior and, even more striking, this populatuion seems to be active as soon as the male becomes sexually aroused. Previous studies in the rat have shown that the activity of the SEG cells increases with mounts and intromissions, but not with mount attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Truitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). To our surprise, repeated electrical stimulation was accompanied by a marked decrease in BSM activity, a result that was not due to a deterioration of the preparation. Moreover, if male mice were allowed to have sex and ejaculate just prior to the electric stimulation experiment, BSM activity was much lower and resembled the activity obtained after multiple rounds. These results indicate the Gal+ neurons are recruited through the entire copulation, corroborating a continuous dialogue with the rest of the body and a possible prominent role of the spinal cord in the control of the refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Turley and Rowland, 2013</xref>), contrary to what is currently hypothesized.</p><p id="P29">Lastly the chemogenetic ablation of the Gal+ population caused a disruption in sexual behavior. Interestingly, and again in contrast to the rat SEG, whose ablation led to a complete abolishment of ejaculation while leaving copulatory patterns intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>), only 3 out of 12 animals in our study did not ejaculate. However, the session was artificially interrupted after a certain time limit, so we do not know if they would be able to ejaculate if more time was given. Also, and contrary to the rat, we observed an altered sexual behavior in all animals, with an increase in the latency to ejaculate and the number of mounts with probing and a longer duration of the latter, suggesting that immediate sensory penile feedback when the Gal+ cells are ablated is partially disrupted. Two immediate questions arise from these results: how can animals still ejaculate if the Gal+ neurons that contact the BSM-MNs are gone and how and where is the penile sensory feedback treated to reach ejaculation? The first part may be due to a small percentage of Gal+ cells not being ablated, which could suffice to integrate pelvic sensory input and drive ejaculation. But also, redundant spinal circuits may compensate for the Gal+ cell loss. Namely, spinal circuits controlling pelvic floor muscles and organs, which are responsible for sexual behaviour, micturition and defecation, share common connections between the spinal and brain nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Schellino, Boido and Vercelli, 2020</xref>). For instance, connections between the sacral parasympathetic nuclei, that control pelvic organ function (i.e. emission), and the BSM-MN nucleus have been described for cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nadelhaft, deGroat and Morgan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Holstege and Tan, 1987</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hancock and Peveto, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Holstege and Tan (1987</xref>), hypothesized that BSM-MNs are a special class of neurons not only of somatic but also autonomic nature and thus, capable of controlling both functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Holstege and Tan, 1987</xref>). Moreover, direct brain spinal projections, namely to the BSM-MNs may drive expulsion of sperm independently of Gal+ cells. Indeed, anatomical evidence points to a direct connection between the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the BSM-MNs in the cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Holstege and Tan, 1987</xref>) and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Argiolas and Melis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">De Groat, 2016</xref>). This pathway seems to regulate erection, but also rat sexual behaviour in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Argiolas and Melis, 2004</xref>). In addition, in rats, ejaculation can be facilitated by an oxytonergic PVN projection onto SEG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Oti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Projections from the Barrington’s nucleus also known as the pontine micturition center, have been shown to connect to pelvic-related nuclei in the spinal cord (in rats: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nuding and Nadelhaft, 1998</xref>; in cats: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Holstege <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; in humans: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Huynh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and electrical stimulation of the medial-lateral areas induced emission and expulsion-like responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Holstege <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). Regarding the sensory relay, rat and human studies showed that pressure increase in the prostatic urethra caused by the arrival of sperm and seminal fluid at the time of emission, is sufficient to induce ejaculatory-like contractions in the BSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Shafik and El-Sibai, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Tanahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

Regarding the second question, nobody knows where arousal is controlled and how sensory input impinges on such circuit. But our results point towards an involvement of the spinal network.</p><p id="P30">Taken together we have identified a cluster of Gal+ cells in the lumbar spinal cord of mice that are directly connected to BSM-MNs and that seem to be involved in the integration of sensory signals during copulation and sexual satiety, thereby taking a more central and intricate involvement in the control of mice copulatory behavior than a simple reflex arc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P31">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Susana Q.

In order to stimulate the penis electrically (by wrapping a nerve cuff electrode around the penis) or mechanically (by locally applying an airpuff) the penis was gently pulled out. Electrical (6V) and mechanical (0.5 - 1 mbar) stimulations of the penis were done at either 200 Hz (100 pulses) or 5 Hz (3 x 5 pulses, 100ms). Stimulation protocols were first run in an anesthetized male mouse with an intact brain spinal connection before disrupting the latter by performing a spinalization between the thoracic segments 9 and 10. Electrical and/or mechanical stimulation protocols were then repeated in the anesthetized preparation (N = 7).</p><p id="P47">For local field potential (LFP) recordings of optogenetically tagged Gal+ or BSM MNs, a glass electrode (resistance ranging from 4 to 6 MΩ) made of borosilicate glass tubes (Hilgenberg) was lowered at the position of the Gal+ cells or the BSM-MNs and optogenetic stimulations were performed until encountering the maximal light triggered LFP response. Subsequently the glass pipette was left in the place at which the highest light triggered LFP response of BSMMNs or Gal+ cells was encountered. Finally the penis and leg were mechanically stimulated with a locally applied airpuff (5Hz; 5 pulses, 100ms) while monitoring LFP responses and EMG responses in BSM and TA muscles. Analysis was performed in spike2 and data plotted in Excel and Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Behavior</title><sec id="S25"><title>Sexual priming prior electrical stimulations</title><p id="P48">Male mice were single-housed and trained in sexual behaviour, with a primed ovariectomised female, until ejaculation was reached in 3 sessions. Afterwards, the animals were divided into two groups: one group was allowed to perform 5 mounts with intromissions (N = 7) and the second group was allowed to perform the whole repertoire of sexual behavior until reaching ejaculation (N = 8). Immediately after the behavior, the animals were anesthetized and used for <italic>in vivo</italic> electrical stimulations as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>cFos experiments</title><p id="P49">Male Gal-cre x TdTomato mice were single-housed and trained in sexual behaviour, with a primed ovariectomised female, until ejaculation was reached in 3 sessions. After one week, the animals underwent a behavioral paradigm and divided into three different groups: in the first group, animals were allowed to socially interact with a female for 10 min (Aroused, N=7), without performing mounts or intromissions; the second group of male mice performed five mounts with intromissions (5 Mounts, N=5), after which the female was removed; in the third group, the animals were allowed to reach ejaculation (Ejaculation, N=6). In another group of animals (Cage control) male mice were either alone in their home cages, without sexual encounters (N=3), or had the same sexual training but were then alone in the behaving box for 10min (N=3), in order to assess the baseline neuronal activity in the spinal cord (no differences in the cFos count was observed in these two control conditions). After the behavior session, male mice were placed back in their home cages for 90 minutes to allow for sufficient cFos expression. Finally, the animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by a cold 4% PFA in 0.01mol/L PBS. Spinal cords were removed from the spine and kept for 1h in 4% PFA before transferring them for another hour into 0.01M PBS. Subsequently spinal cords were stored overnight in 30% sucrose, 0.1% azide in order to cryo-protect the tissue. Spinal cords were embedded in frozen section medium for half an hour at -80°C in 2-methylbutane solution before mounting them in the cryostat. The spinal cords were sectioned at 30μm for post-hoc immunohistochemical staining as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>DTR experiments</title><p id="P50">Male Gal-cre x TdTomato animals (2-3 months old) were single-housed and trained for sexual behaviour until ejaculation was reached once. After that, the animals were spinally injected with an AA8V-FLEX-DTR-GFP (N = 12) at the location of the SEG cells (allowing for the specific expression of the Diphtheria Toxin Receptor), or had a sham surgery (N = 7), as described above, and allowed to recover for 2 weeks. Afterwards, the animals underwent another round of sexual behaviour training to confirm that they were still reliably ejaculating. After this, the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 ng/g (0.1 mL/10 g) of Diphtheria Toxin (DT, Sigma, D0564-1MG). One week after, the animals were transferred to an experimental box, where they had a 10 min habituation, after which a primed ovariectomised female was introduced. The animals were allowed to perform the full repertoire of sexual behaviour and after ejaculation was reached, or 90min after female introduction passed when sexual behaviours were observed, the animals were returned to their homecage. If the animals did not initiate behaviour, the experiment was stop after 30min and they underwent the sexual experimental paradigm for two more weeks. In the final session, or after ejaculation, the animals were returned to their homecage and a 90 min interval was kept before perfusion, for cFos expression to occur. Finally, the animals were deeply anesthetized, transcardially perfused and the spinal cords collected for histological processing as described above (<italic>cFos experiments</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Ovariectomy and hormonal priming</title><p id="P51">All female mice (N=20) used as sexual stimuli were ovariectomised. Briefly, female mice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane in oxygen and placed into a mouth piece allowing for continuous isoflurane anesthesia. After all reflexes were gone, an incision was made at the center of the lower back. The skin was separated from the muscle towards both sides of the back. After that, on one side, leveled with the hindlimb, the ovary fat pad was located and a small incision was made in the muscle above this area. The ovary was gently pulled and the connection between the ovary and the uterus was cut using a cauterizer. The same procedure was repeated for the second ovary. Finally, the incision in the back was sutured and the animal was allowed to fully recover on a heating pad. After two weeks of recovery, the animals underwent hormonal priming during which they received an estrogen (1 mg/ml, Sigma E815 in sesame oil) injection 2 days prior to the sexual behavior experiment and a progesterone (5 mg/ml, Sigma P0130 in sesame oil) injection 4h before the experiment was scheduled. Hormonal priming with estrogen and progesterone was conducted before each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="S30"><title>Histological analysis</title><p id="P52">After immunohistochemical labeling of cFos (as described above), the spinal cord sections were imaged using a Slide Scanner (Zeiss AxioScan.Z1, Zeiss Microscopy). The obtained images were processed using the Zen Software (Zen 2.6, Zeiss Microscopy), and tiff images of each channel (488 for the cFos, cy3 for the Gal-cre TdTomato cells and cy5 for the Nissl staining) were exported. These tiff files were, together with the corresponding image of the spinal segment from the mouse spinal cord atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Watson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), opened in Photoshop (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe). Once the overlap between the spinal atlas outlines and the immunohistochemical tiff image was adjusted, the cells present in laminae X (around the central canal and the location of the Gal+ cells) of the spinal cord were manually counted by placing dots on each cell. The manual counting procedure was done for both channels, the cFos in green and tdtomato in red. Custom written Matlab code was finally used to count the dots and identify overlaps between the two channels. Counting of cFos and Gal-cre x TdTomato positive cells was done blindly.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Behavioral Analysis</title><p id="P53">The DTR behavioral experiments were carefully recorded using two point gray cameras (Teledyne FLIR), at 60 frames per second. The cameras acquired a top and front video of the cage and were controlled using a bonsai script (Bonsai Visual Reactive Programming). Afterwards, the videos were analyzed using Python Video Annotator (developed at the Champalimaud Foundation). A wide range of behaviors was annotated, namely: sniffing of the anogenital area of the female; mount attempts (when the male was not able to perform intromissions) mounts with probing (shallow pelvic movements when the male is trying to intromit but still has not inserted the penis); mounts with intra-vaginal thrustings; intra-vaginal thurstings (when the male successful inserted the penis in the female’s vagina); and finally ejaculation (time between the beginning of shivering and the moment the male dismounted the female). The duration, in frames, for each behavior was then aligned to the camera timestamps, acquired during video recording. Analysis of behavioral timestamp data was performed using a python script in Spyder 3.3.6 (Python).</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P54">Statistical analysis was performed with homemade code in Matlab and Python (scipy and statsmodels). All error ranges represent standard error of the mean. For two-sample comparisons of a single variable, Student’s t test was used, unless in cases when the underlying distributions were non-Gaussian (Shapiro-Wilk test, p&lt;0.05), where a two-tailed Mann-Whitney-U Test was performed. When multiple variables were compared, a Kruskal Wallis test or a Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank test were used since the data did not follow a Gaussian distribution. Probabilities of the null hypothesis p&lt;0.05 were judged to be statistically significant. Elements of violin plots: center line, median; box limits, upper (75) and lower (25) quartiles; and whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range.</p><p id="P55">To estimate the inter-thrust interval (ITI) versus mount progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7T</xref>), the thrust number was divided by the total number of thrusts in the mount, what we call mount progression. Then data from all the mounts and all the sessions from the different groups was pulled together and a non-parametric kernel regression was performed. The shadow region corresponds to the standard deviation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Movie 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS155684-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_1.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" id="d14aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Movie 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS155684-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_2.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" id="d14aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS155684-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank B.
