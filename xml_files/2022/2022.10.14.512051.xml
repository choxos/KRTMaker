Although they are structurally similar, we found that the unique N-terminal extension of CUL4B is heavily phosphorylated during mitosis, and the phosphorylation pattern is perturbed in the CUL4B-P50L mutation causing X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Phenotypic characterization and mutational analysis revealed that CUL4B phosphorylation is required for efficient progression through mitosis, controlling spindle positioning and cortical tension. Interestingly, while CUL4B phosphorylation triggers chromatin exclusion, it critically promotes binding to actin regulators and two previously unrecognized, CUL4B-specific DCAFs, LIS1 and WDR1. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments and biochemical analysis revealed that LIS1 and WDR1 interact with DDB1, but their binding requires the phosphorylated N-terminal domain of CUL4B. Together, our study uncovers previously unrecognized DCAFs relevant for mitosis and brain development that specifically bind CUL4B, but not the CUL4B-P50L patient mutant, by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) comprise the largest family of RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases and catalyze approximately 20% of all ubiquitination reactions leading to proteasomal degradation in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. CRLs use one of eight cullins (CRL1-3, CRL4A-B, CRL5, CRL7, CRL9) as a scaffolding subunit for their modular assembly. CRL activity depends on the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 and additional mechanisms altering substrate recruitment, highlighting the high complexity of CRL regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">CUL4-based E3 ligases regulate many cellular activities, including chromatin-associated processes like DNA damage repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. CRL4 complexes engage DDB1-CUL4 associated factors (DCAFs) as substrate receptors (SRs), which are characterized by WD40 domains and a helix-loop-helix motif mediating their binding to the adaptor DDB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, vertebrates encode two conserved paralogs, CUL4A and CUL4B, with <italic>CUL4B</italic> gene located on the X-chromosome. The paralogs share over 80% sequence identity and all functional domains fold into nearly identical structures.</p><p id="P6">The major difference between CUL4A and CUL4B is an extended N-terminus unique to CUL4B, which is mostly unstructured and thus commonly truncated in biochemical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. As both cullins are widely expressed and use DDB1 to bind a common set of SRs, CRL4A and CRL4B complexes are thought to function in a redundant manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, several studies report CRL4A or CRL4B-specific functions in diverse cellular contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, while targeted MS quantification confirmed that CUL4A and CUL4B equally interact with most previously identified DCAFs, a small subset was found to preferentially bind CRL4A or CRL4B complexes. For example, CRBN prefers to assemble with CRL4A, while AMBRA1 favors CRL4B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, the underlying reason for this DCAF preference is not understood.</p><p id="P7">Distinct functions of CRL4A and CRL4B complexes are also apparent from studies in mice. CUL4B is essential during mouse embryogenesis, since deletion leads to cell cycle defects and apoptosis in extra embryonic tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. CUL4A knockout mice, however, show no effects on embryonic viability but fail spermatogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, CUL4B knockouts in mouse epiblasts identified specific neuronal and behavioral defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In line with these findings, mutations in human CUL4B but not CUL4A are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, consistent with non-redundant functions of the two cullin scaffolds in brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. While most patient mutations result in loss of CRL4B ligase activity, a single point mutation of CUL4B (P50L) mapping to its unique N-terminus also causes XLID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.</p><p id="P8">Here, we examined the differential roles of CUL4A and CUL4B in cell cycle progression. We found that cells lacking CUL4B show mitotic spindle positioning defects and reduced cortical tension. Molecular analysis revealed that CUL4B is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis, which increases its interaction with many actin regulators and two previously unrecognized DCAFs, LIS1 and WDR1. Indeed, cells expressing phosphorylation-defective CUL4B mutants including the patient-derived XLID mutant P50L exhibit mitotic defects and the mutant proteins fail to interact with LIS1 and WDR1. Importantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution experiments confirm that LIS1 and WDR1 bind DDB1, but also require a second, phosphorylation-dependent interface with the unique amino terminal domain of CUL4B. Our study thus provides a molecular mechanism explaining CRL4B specificity with implications for brain development and identifies a previously unrecognized subset of DCAFs that bind CUL4B in a phosphorylation-dependent manner during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CRL4B-specific functions in mitosis</title><p id="P9">To investigate functional differences between CRL4A and CRL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), we used RNAi to knock down either CUL4A, CUL4B or DDB1 in HeLa Kyoto cells, with specific downregulation verified by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Upon RNAi-depletion of DDB1, CUL4A and CUL4B accumulated predominantly in their deneddylated, inactive form. In contrast, neddylated CUL4A accumulated upon depletion of CUL4B, and conversely neddylated CUL4B increased with CUL4A depletion, implying a potential compensation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Despite this paralog compensation, MTT assays revealed decreased growth rates of approximately 30% for CUL4A and 20% for CUL4B RNAi, respectively, compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The growth rate of CRISPR/Cas9 CUL4B knockout cells (ΔCUL4B) was similarly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1A, B, C</xref>). This growth delay phenotype was enhanced to 40-50% when combining CUL4A and CUL4B depletion or upon the depletion of the common adaptor DDB1, implying redundant as well as non-redundant functions of CRL4A and CRL4B for cell growth.</p><p id="P10">Since CRL4 E3 ligase activity is important in DNA replication and DNA damage repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the growth delay might be caused by accumulation of DNA damage. Indeed, the number of cells positive for phosphorylated histone H2A.X (γH2A.X) increased more than 10-fold following CUL4A depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similarly, γH2A.X staining by immunofluorescence showed an increase of approximately 25% in cells RNAi-depleted for CUL4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, γH2.AX levels in CUL4B-depleted or ΔCUL4B cells were unchanged relative to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1D, F</xref>), implying that the observed growth delay is caused by a distinct CRL4B function.</p><p id="P11">We next used brightfield live-cell microscopy to visualize division of cells lacking CUL4A or CUL4B. Interestingly, cells lacking CUL4B exhibit a significant lengthening of mitotic duration, which was not observed in CUL4A-depleted or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1G</xref>). Indeed, cells with impaired CRL4B took on average 15-25 minutes longer compared to control cells when measured from rounding-up upon mitotic entry until the onset of cytokinesis. Consequently, we hypothesized a CRL4B-specific function during mitosis as a possible cause for the observed growth delay of CUL4B depleted cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CRL4B has a unique function that is important for efficient execution of mitosis, explaining the observed growth delay of CUL4B depleted cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The P50L patient mutation alters mitotic-specific phosphorylation of CUL4B’s unique N-terminal extension</title><p id="P12">We examined CUL4B expression and localization through the cell cycle. As expected, CUL4A and CUL4B are expressed throughout the cell cycle, and their neddylated, active forms are present at all stages. However, when cells were arrested in mitosis either by taxol or nocodazole, CUL4B migrated significantly slower on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), indicative of a post-translational modification. Indeed, slower-migrating CUL4B species were readily reversed by incubating mitotic extracts with lambda-phosphatase (λ-PP) suggesting phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). No mitotic phosphorylation could be detected for CUL4A or when CUL4B was analyzed in extracts prepared from cells arrested in S-phase with thymidine or G2 with RO-3306. CUL4B phosphorylation was also monitored after a mitotic shake-off in asynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) or in cells released from a G2 block, thus synchronously progressing from G2 into mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2A</xref>). In both cases, slower-migrating CUL4B was observed, demonstrating that CUL4B but not CUL4A is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. Moreover, phosphorylation sites during mitosis were contained in the unique N-terminus of CUL4B, since deletion of the unique N-terminus of CUL4B abolished the phosphorylation of CUL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Searching the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phosphosite.org/">phosphosite.org</ext-link> database revealed many phospho-sites located in the unique amino-terminal extension of CUL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To systematically identify the mitotic phosphorylation sites, we immunoprecipitated CUL4B from mitotic cells and mapped phosphorylated peptides after TiO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment using mass-spectrometry. To facilitate efficient immunoprecipitation without overexpression, we replaced endogenous CUL4B with a functional HA-tagged CUL4B fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2 C, D</xref>). Phospho-site enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry identified several sites (S26,28; T49,52; S193) in the unique N-terminus of CUL4B, which are phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Importantly, T49 emerged as a major mitotic site, which conforms to the minimal consensus site for proline-directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays in the presence of [γ-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2E</xref>) demonstrated that purified CUL4B, but not CUL4A, was readily phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B, and to a lesser extent also by PLK1 and CK1.</p><p id="P14">Since T49 is located next to the P50L mutation found in XLID patients, we performed CDK1 <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using purified CUL4B-P50L as a substrate. In addition, we analyzed a CUL4B mutant (NP1) that has all serine and threonine sites within the first ninety amino acids of the N-terminus mutated to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Indeed, CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of the P50L mutant was reduced compared to wild-type (WT), and almost abolished with the NP1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Importantly, re-addition of the T49 phospho-site to the NP1 mutant partially restored a P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> signal, while T49 phosphorylation was strongly reduced when combined with the P50L mutation. We conclude that the unique amino terminal extension of CUL4B is phosphorylated on multiple sites during mitosis and that CDK1-cyclin B is the main CUL4B kinase <italic>in vitro</italic>. A major mitotic phospho-site is T49, and its phosphorylation is strongly diminished by the P50L patient mutation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mitotic CUL4B phosphorylation promotes progression through mitosis and regulates chromatin association</title><p id="P15">In CUL4B knockout HeLa Flp-in cells (ΔCUL4B<sub>Flp</sub>), we quantified mitotic duration when complemented with inducible expression of CUL4B WT, or the phosphorylation-defective mutants P50L or NP1 by live-cell microscopy. The NP1 and P50L mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels, while expression of CUL4B WT was slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The mutations neither altered expression levels nor the neddylation status of CUL4A or CUL4B. However, expression of both phosphorylation-defective mutants NP1 and P50L failed to rescue the mitotic delay of cells lacking CUL4B, and mitotic duration remained around 90 minutes in contrast to 60 minutes observed for CUL4B WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3A</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that mitotic CUL4B phosphorylation and in particular the T49 site is important for mitotic function.</p><p id="P16">To test the underlying mechanism, we used immunofluorescence to compare chromatin recruitment of endogenous CUL4A and CUL4B during the cell cycle. To simultaneously observe the two CUL4 variants, we used the endogenously HA-tagged CUL4B cell line and co-stained with antibodies specific for CUL4A and the HA-tag. We also employed pre-extraction to decrease cytoplasmic CUL4 signal. While both CUL4A and HA-CUL4B are present in the nucleus during interphase, we observed a 2-fold reduction of CUL4B signal on mitotic chromatin, while the CUL4A signal slightly increased at the chromatin in metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Cellular fractionation assays of asynchronous or mitotic cells consistently showed that CUL4B was excluded from mitotic chromatin, while CUL4A remained bound to chromatin throughout mitosis. Chromatin recruitment for CUL4A and CUL4B was abolished after RNAi of DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3B</xref>), consistent with earlier reports that CRL4 chromatin recruitment is mediated via specific substrate receptors like DDB2 or RepID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">To test whether exclusion of CUL4B from mitotic chromatin is due to phosphorylation, we used endogenously HA-tagged CUL4B mutant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining after cytoplasmic pre-extraction revealed that a N-terminal truncated mutant of CUL4B (ΔN) remains bound to chromatin, comparable to CUL4A localization. Likewise, the NP1 mutant is partially retained, but no chromatin dissociation defect could be detected for the P50L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Cellular fractionation assays of mitotic cells transiently expressing Flag-tagged CUL4B, or the two phospho-mutants confirmed slight retention of the NP1 mutant, while the P50L mutant dissociated from mitotic chromosomes comparable to CUL4B WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3C</xref>). We conclude that while phosphorylation of the unique amino-terminal domain triggers dissociation of CUL4B from mitotic chromosomes, this effect cannot solely explain the function of CUL4B in regulating mitosis.</p><p id="P18">Since most CUL4B mutations found in XLID patients decrease CRL4B activity or protein stability, we next tested whether phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain regulates ubiquitination activity. We assembled recombinant CRL4 complexes with CUL4A, CUL4B or the phosphorylation-defective P50L or NP1 mutants. Additionally, we included the neddylation-defective CUL4B-K895R and the L864Afs*13 disease mutant. We monitored lenalidomide-induced CKIα ubiquitination to quantify CRL4B<sup>CRBN</sup> activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, no significant difference in CKIα ubiquitination kinetics could be detected between CRL4B WT, the phosphorylation-defective CRL4B mutants and CRL4A, implying that phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain is not required for E3 ligase activity. In contrast, the L864Afs*13 disease mutant strongly decreased CKIα ubiquitination, while ubiquitination activity of the CUL4B-K895R mutant was completely abolished. Taken together, these data indicate that after release from mitotic chromosomes, phosphorylated CUL4B may associate with novel factors to regulate mitotic progression.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LIS1 and WDR1 function as unconventional, phospho-dependent CRL4B DCAFs during mitosis</title><p id="P19">To identify proteins interacting with CUL4B in a phosphorylation-dependent manner during mitosis, we set up a SILAC-based mass spectrometric approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Briefly, HA-tagged CUL4B or the phosphorylation-defective P50L or NP1 mutants were immunoprecipitated from SILAC-labeled cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole. DCAF exchange during lysis was inhibited by blocking the NEDD8 cycle by addition of the CSN- (CSN5i-3) and NAE inhibitors (MLN4924)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA.II-antibodies and mixed before the last wash. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by LC-MS/MS. As expected, this approach verified that essential components like NEDD8, DDB1 and RBX1 as well as the SR exchange factor CAND1 bind CUL4B by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Likewise, we identified CUL4A as a strong interactor of CUL4B and phosphorylation-defective mutants, indicating the formation of heterodimers or oligomeric assemblies of CRL4A and CRL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Importantly, however, this analysis also revealed several proteins particularly enriched in the phospho-specific interactome of CUL4B. Most notably, we discovered LIS1 and WDR1, which interact with WT CUL4B but show reduced binding to phosphorylation-defective P50L or NP1 mutants. Both proteins possess WD40 domains followed by a putative helix-loop-helix motif characteristic for established DCAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and may thus function as unconventional DCAFs specific for phosphorylated CRL4B.</p><p id="P20">To validate these findings, we focused on three main aspects, namely functional overlap with CUL4B during mitosis, as well as mitosis- and phosphorylation-specific binding. To test whether depletion of LIS1 and/or WDR1 can explain the mitotic defects observed in cells lacking CUL4B, we used live-cell imaging to determine mitotic duration. While RNAi-depletion of CUL4B and WDR1 was highly efficient, LIS1 knockdown was moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, WDR1- and to a lesser extend LIS1-depleted cells were delayed in mitosis, thus phenocopying at least in part CUL4B-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4B</xref>). The mitosis-specific interaction of CUL4B with LIS1 and WDR1 was verified by immunoprecipitating HA-tagged CUL4B from cells arrested in S-phase by thymidine or in mitosis with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Phospho-specificity was confirmed by comparing immunoprecipitations of HA-tagged CUL4B and the phosphorylation-defective mutants NP1 and P50L in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole. Indeed, these assays demonstrated mitosis-specific binding of CUL4B to LIS1 and WDR1, which was not observed when analyzing the phosphorylation-defective mutants NP1 and P50L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that LIS1 and WDR1 function as phospho-specific DCAFs (pDCAF), assembling with phosphorylated CRL4B (pCRL4B) to regulate progression through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>LIS1 and WDR1 binding is mediated via two different binding sites one on DDB1 and one on CUL4B</title><p id="P21">We next used reconstituted complexes (DDB1, RBX1 and either CUL4A or CUL4B) and established a fluorescence polarization (FP)- assay to dissect binding affinities of LIS1 and WDR1 to different CRL4 subunits, Since LIS1 and WDR1 possess the canonical helix-loop-helix motif predicted to mediate DDB1 binding, we performed pull-down experiments using LIS1, WDR1 or for control DCAF8 from Sf9-extracts co-expressing DDB1. Indeed, both LIS1 and WDR1 directly interact with DDB1 under these conditions, although with weaker affinity compared to the conventional DCAF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5A</xref>). FP assays confirmed that LIS1 and WDR1 bind DDB1 with a K<sub>d</sub> of approx. 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Surprisingly, we also detected interaction of LIS1 and WDR1 with CUL4B after co-expression in Sf9 cells in the absence of DDB1. This implies two distinct binding sites of LIS1 and WDR1, one on DDB1 and another one on the N-terminus of CUL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 C, D</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, purified LIS1 and WDR1 preferentially interacted with CRL4B compared to CRL4A, which lacks the N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 E, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5B, C</xref>).

While we did not detect grossly aberrant actin structures in CUL4B or LIS1 RNAi depleted cells, we observed severe blebbing and cell death in WDR1 depleted cells. We also used atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a cell confinement assay to assess actin-dependent cortical tension and cell stiffness during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6A</xref>). Interestingly, we detected a strong reduction in the initial confinement force (or peak force) in cells lacking CUL4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6B</xref>). Similarly, WDR1 or LIS1 depletion reduced this peak force, although to a lower extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). In addition, the tension of the actin cortex was strongly reduced in LIS1 and CUL4B depleted cells, while WDR1 depletion only led to a small decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).

Indeed, immunofluorescence experiments revealed that ΔCUL4B cells show an increased number of off-centered mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6C</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we used live-cell microscopy to follow spindle dynamics in single cells. Kymographs showed enhanced spindle mobility in CUL4B depleted cells and spindle movement increased 5-fold compared to controls. Assessment of the spindle angle indicated that the mitotic spindle was not stably anchored to the cortex with an increased mobility in all three dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). As expected, similar spindle defects were detected in LIS1-depleted cells, while lack of WDR1 did not significantly alter spindle dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Thus, phenotypic characterization indicates that CRL4B<sup>WDR1</sup> regulates mitotic duration possibly by actin rearrangements, while CRL4B<sup>LIS1</sup> is required to stably anchor the mitotic spindle to the cell cortex and increase cortex tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Our study establishes a novel CRL4B-specific regulatory mechanism comprising cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation of its unique unstructured N-terminal domain. We demonstrate that phosphorylated CUL4B engages with the previously unrecognized DCAFs, LIS1 and WDR1, which together regulate cortex tension and spindle positioning during mitosis. Since the P50L patient mutation is specifically defective for its mitotic phosphorylation and in turn fails to bind LIS1 and WDR1, our findings provide important insights to understand the molecular mechanisms causing XLID and possibly other human neurological diseases.</p><p id="P27">We found that the unique CUL4B-extension contains many S/T-residues, which are phosphorylated during mitosis. Indeed, several mitotic kinases including CDK1, PLK1 or Aurora B phosphorylate CUL4B <italic>in vitro</italic>. CDK1-cyclin B emerged as the major CUL4B kinase preferentially phosphorylating T49, the major site conforming to the minimal S/T-P-X motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the P50L XLID patient mutation interferes with phosphorylation of the adjacent T49 residue, explaining its mitotic defect. CDK1 sites often promote PLK1 binding, which then further increases phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to explore whether non-mitotic kinases may similarly shape appropriate cellular responses by regulating CUL4B function through phosphorylation of its unique amino-terminal domain in response to different environmental conditions.</p><p id="P28">We found that CUL4B phosphorylation is required for efficient progression through mitosis by two mechanisms. First, mitotic phosphorylation triggers its dissociation from mitotic chromatin, and second, phosphorylation allows binding of CUL4B to previously unrecognized DCAFs, including WDR1 and LIS1. Both WDR1 and LIS1 possess WD40 domains and bind DDB1 most likely through a predicted helix-turn-helix motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Importantly, however, their interaction is stabilized by a separate binding motif generated by the phosphorylated amino-terminal extension of CUL4B. Together, the two distinct binding sites promote the assembly of stoichiometric CRL4B complexes with low micromolar affinity like conventional DCAFs binding to CRL4s. Biophysical and structural work will be required to understand the underlying properties and deduce critical residues stabilizing the DDB1-LIS1 and DDB1-WDR1 heterodimers bound to phosphorylated CUL4B. It is possible that additional CRL4B-specific DCAFs exist, including unconventional DCAFs which require other modifications of the amino-terminus. An interesting candidate could be AMBRA1, which was recently shown to regulate cyclin D degradation via CUL4B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Importantly, functional importance of the unique N-terminal region of CUL4B was also demonstrated for the Dioxin receptor, which binds independently of DDB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, WDR1 was previously reported to function as a DCAF in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which encodes CUL4 with an amino-terminal extension like CUL4B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. It will thus be interesting to compare evolutionary conserved features, as the unique amino-terminal extension increases the repertoire of substrate receptors specifically functioning within CRL4B complexes. Our observations may also be relevant for targeted protein degradation, since several degraders rely on substrate recruitment by the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> E3 ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Exploiting phospho-dependent CRL4B substrate receptors may restrict neo-substrate targeting to proliferating cells in mitosis.</p><p id="P29">Several studies have addressed molecular functions of LIS1 and WDR1 in mitosis. LIS1 regulates spindle mobility and orientation by regulating the dynein/dynactin complex and by increasing the density of astral microtubules, which may in turn affect cortical tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Cells lacking CUL4B similarly exhibit spindle positioning and cortical tension defects, and it is thus tempting to speculate that pCRL4B<sup>LIS1</sup> regulates dynein/dynactin activity. Less is known about the molecular functions of WDR1, but available data suggest that it likely controls the actomyosin network and functions in mitotic cell rounding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">While LIS1 and WDR1 coordinately regulate cortical tension and cytoskeletal dynamics, it remains to be examined if and how these cortical defects alter mitotic timing. In mitosis, the cortex becomes thinner with increased tension due to RhoA activation, which allows cells to change to the rounded-up morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Both spindle orientation and chromosome separation rely on the actomyosin cortex providing a rigid scaffold to counteract the traction forces exerted on astral microtubules by motors pulling towards the spindle poles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Given the overlapping defects of cells lacking CUL4B, LIS1 and WDR1 in cortical tension and cytoskeletal dynamics, the formation of functional CRL4B<sup>LIS1</sup> and CRL4B<sup>WDR1</sup> E3 ligase complexes may contribute to these functions during mitosis. A critical next step to test this exciting hypothesis will be the identification of relevant substrates of mitotic CRL4B complexes. Candidates include proteins directly binding to LIS1 and WDR1, and we indeed found dynactin and many actin-regulators as mitotic-specific interactors of CUL4B. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if these candidates are indeed critical substrates for pCUL4B-dependent ubiquitination.</p><p id="P31">Our results provide important molecular insight into the function of CRL4B in XLID and related intellectual disability disorders. In contrast to most <italic>CUL4B</italic> patient mutations, the amino-terminal P50L XLID patient mutation neither impacts assembly nor catalytic activity of CRL4B-based E3 ligase complexes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Instead, we demonstrate that this mutation affects CUL4B’s mitotic function by reducing mitotic T49 phosphorylation, thereby preventing its interaction with phospho-specific DCAFs such as LIS1 and WDR1. This regulatory mechanism could explain why CRL4A fails to compensate CRL4B-specific functions causing XLID.
