They are involved in essential processes in the cytoplasm and have also nuclear functions. Malaria parasites <italic>(Plasmodium</italic> spp.) have two actin isoforms that differ from each other and from canonical actins in structure and filament-forming properties. Actin I has an essential role in motility and is fairly well characterized. The structure and function of actin II are not as well understood, but mutational analyses have revealed two essential functions in male gametogenesis and in the zygote. Here, we present expression analysis, high-resolution filament structures, and biochemical characterization of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actin II. We show that it is expressed in male gametocytes and zygotes and associated with the nucleus in both stages in filament-like structures. Unlike actin I, actin II readily forms long filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, and near-atomic structures in the presence or absence of jasplakinolide reveal very similar structures. Small but significant differences compared to other actins in the openness and twist, the active site, the D-loop, and the plug region contribute to filament stability. Mutational analyses suggest that long and stable filaments are necessary for male gametogenesis, while the second function in the zygote stage also requires fine-tuned regulation by methylation of histidine 73. Actin II polymerizes <italic>via</italic> the classical nucleation-elongation mechanism and has a critical concentration of ~0.1 μM at the steady-state, like actin I and canonical actins. Similarly to actin I, dimers are a stable form of actin II at equilibrium.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Biophysics and Computational Biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>filament</kwd><kwd>jasplakinolide</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>polymerization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The protozoan phylum Apicomplexa consists of more than 6000 parasitic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. This group includes <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., well known as causative agents of human malaria, as well as several parasites responsible for diseases in other animals of socioeconomic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The life cycle of malaria parasites involves several stages that go through different morphological states and infect different cell types in the mosquito and the vertebrate host.</p><p id="P4">Actin filaments are essential for parasite growth, development, motility, and host cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Unlike other apicomplexan parasites, including <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, which have only a single actin isoform, there are two actin isoforms (actin I and actin II) in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Especially actin II is one of the most divergent actins among eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> actin I shares 82-83% and actin II only 76-77% of common sequence with canonical actins from opisthokonts. The two actin isoforms have 79% sequence identity with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. While the function of actin I in motility has been intensively studied, less is known about the functions of actin II, which is specific for gametogenesis and insect stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Mutants lacking actin II have a pleiotropic phenotype during the mosquito stages. Actin II is necessary for egress of the male gametocyte (microgametocyte) from the red blood cell and is strictly required for exflagellation of male gametes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. In the mutants, motile ookinetes are normally formed, but the protein has a role in the female gamete or zygote that manifests itself as a block of oocyst development in the absence of actin II. Complementation of an actin II deletion mutant with actin I resulted in poor restoration of exflagellation. Some ookinetes were recovered, and these traversed the midgut epithelium and formed oocysts, which however did not develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, complementation of the deletion mutant with a gene expressing an actin I chimera, where the DNase I-binding (D-) loop in subdomain 2 was replaced by muscle actin, restored exflagellation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The biological functions of actins are dependent on transitions between the globular G-form and the filamentous F-form, which are tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The structure of monomeric G-actin is well known; there are almost 200 crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In contrast, structural data on F-form actin has been more challenging to obtain. During the last years, advances in single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled determining high-resolution structures of F-actin from different organisms, such as skeletal muscle a-actin from <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], <italic>Leishmania major</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and actin I from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] to resolutions between 2.15-3 Å. The short length and instability of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> actin I has allowed structure determination only of filaments stabilized by jasplakinolide (JAS).</p><p id="P7">Here, we explored the function of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> actin II in the parasite. We provide a detailed analysis of expression of actin II in gametocytes and zygotes, revealing that the protein is mainly found associated with the nucleus in these stages. Furthermore, mutants of actin II reveal that the protein tolerates fewer changes for its function in the development of oocysts than for the function in gametogenesis. The critical role of the conserved residue H73 was revealed in mutant parasites. In addition, we present near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM structures of F-actin II in the ADP-Mg state with and without JAS and describe the polymerization properties of the so far uncharacterized actin II.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expression of actin II is restricted to the sexual stages</title><p id="P8">In order to understand in more detail the spatial and temporal localization of actin II in the parasite, we generated transgenic <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites expressing actin II N-terminally fused to FLAG; the small FLAG peptide was not expected to interfere with the function of the protein. Two different transgenic lines were used in the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental material</xref>), one generated by the conventional approach, while the other was a marker-free mutant produced using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Both mutants developed normally at all stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental material</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P9">To determine the timing of expression of actin II, we carried out Western blot analysis of <italic>flag::actII</italic> extracts of purified samples from mixed blood stages, activated gametocytes, and zygotes. The blot was probed with a commercial antibody recognizing FLAG to specifically highlight actin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). This revealed that actin II expression was highly upregulated after induction of gametogenesis. The protein was weakly expressed in mature female gametes, and its amount increased in zygotes. These results are consistent with our genetic analysis, which showed that male gametogenesis was abolished in a mutant lacking actin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], while on the other hand, maternal expression of actin II in the zygote stage is strictly required for development of the oocyst stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Extracts of dissected mosquito midguts containing oocysts (harvested 3 and 10 d post-blood feeding) were also analyzed by Western blot; in this case, no signal was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2a Fig</xref>). These results are consistent with previous results on the transcription of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Immunolabeling using the anti-FLAG antibody to detect actin II was carried out in different stages of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b-e</xref>). Male gametocytes showed a dynamic actin II signal. In non-activated gametocytes, the protein was seen mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b and 1c</xref>), although a weaker signal was also detected in the cytoplasm (white arrow in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), 0 min sample). Later (4 min post activation), its expression was restricted to the nucleus, as revealed by the overlap with DNA. 8 min after activation, the protein was localized in the periphery of the nucleus as long rods in some cells or as dots or very short rods in others. This pattern was seen in a minority of the cells observed (~10%), suggesting that the protein is only briefly present in the rod-like structures. In exflagellating males, the protein was localized in the residual cell with no signal in the flagellar male gamete. In female gametocytes, actin II was not detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2b Fig</xref>), consistent with the results from the Western blot and our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Localization of FLAG::actinII was also investigated in zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d and 1e</xref>). In zygotes, two patterns were seen. Most samples showed diffuse actin II in the nucleus. In rare samples, the protein was localized in rods associated with the nucleus. This may suggest that transient filaments are formed during zygote maturation. In ookinetes, no signal was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2c Fig</xref>), consistent with the Western blot analysis.</p><p id="P11">These results are consistent with our previous studies of mutants lacking actin II, but also offer new insights into the function of the protein. The timing of expression coincides with the stages that are affected in the mutants. The cytoplasmic localization in non-activated gametocytes suggests a direct role of actin II in the release from the surrounding host cell. However, the association with the nucleus in activated gametocytes and zygotes was unexpected, and this finding offers novel insights into the function of actin II. Furthermore, the rod-like structures detected suggest that filaments are transiently formed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Near-atomic-resolution structures of filamentous actin II</title><p id="P12">Actins are very conserved among eukaryotic organisms, owing to their essential functions in different cellular processes. Significant differences in terms of sequence conservation of actin II compared to actin I and α-actins involve the D-loop and subdomains (SD) 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Movie</xref>). To understand the molecular basis of the filament-forming properties of actin II, required specifically in the sexual stages of the parasite life cycle, we set out to determine a high-resolution structure of the actin II filament in the absence and presence of JAS, which has previously facilitated structure determination of the highly unstable actin I filaments.</p><p id="P13">The average resolution of the actin II filaments with and without JAS are similar, 3.3 and 3.5 Å, respectively, according to Fourier correlation, using the 0.143 criterium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S1 Table and S4 Fig</xref>). The actin core is well resolved in both structures with resolutions similar to other filamentous actins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, the D-loop shows a lower local resolution in both reconstructions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S5 Fig</xref>). The first four residues of the N terminus were not resolved. We modeled six subunits of the filament into the density in both cases. Density for ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was clearly identified in both maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conformation of protomers in filamentous parasite actins</title><p id="P14">The helical twist angle for filamentous actin II was -166.9° and was not affected by JAS. Thus, the helical parameters of actin II are closer to α-actin (-166.6) than to actin I (-167.65), as we have also observed before in low-resolution reconstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The overall conformation of the filament and the SDs in the protomers resemble those of other actins. As the filament grows, the D-loop (SD2) at the pointed end inserts into the C terminus (SD3) at the barbed end of the next protomer. The nucleotide-binding pocket located between the inner and outer domains (ID and OD) is occupied by ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As in other actins, the transition from G-to F-form involves significant conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The interdomain dihedral angle (θ) is larger in G-actins and the OD SDs undergoes a “flattening” type of movement upon insertion to the filament (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Movie</xref>). Factin II has a flat conformation like F-α-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and F-actin I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, there are slight differences in the θ angles of the different actins. The θ angle of F-actin II with JAS is rotated 0.3° relative to the F-actin II, 0.9° relative to <italic>G. gallus</italic> F-actin (6DJO), 2.5° and 3.5° relative to the F-actin I structures (5OGW, 6TU4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3 Movie</xref>). In conclusion, F-actin I is more flattened than the other F-actins, including F-actin II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S6 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Likewise, the different conformations of certain side chains in F-actin II were observed compared to G-actin II. The S14 side chain is turned towards H73, which is methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2 Table</xref>), and R270 to D184 in F-actin II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3 Movie</xref>). Moreover, the C terminus is ordered, except for F376, in which the density of the phenyl group is weak. In both structures, H372 interacts with E117 (3 Å). However, the distance between H372 and K113 is longer in F-actin II structures (5.6 Å and 5.5 Å) than F-actin I or G-actin II (4.3 Å and 5 Å) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S7 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the distance between H372 and K114 in actin I is ~3 Å because of the displacement of the N-terminal tip of the helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Protomer interactions within the filament</title><p id="P16">In filamentous form, individual actin protomers interact with protomers from the same strand (intrastrand interactions) and the opposite strand (interstrand interactions). SD2 and SD4 at the pointed end of one protomer interact with SD3 at the barbed end of the adjacent protomer of the same strand. The D-loop (39-50), W-loop (165-172), and some regions of SD3 (270-274, 283-294) and SD4 (195-208, 243-247) are involved in the intrastrand interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S8 Fig</xref>). In skeletal muscle α-actin, the primary intrastrand contact is caused by a hydrophobic key (I287 of SD3) and lock (a groove of SD4) interaction. The residues S199 and V201 in α-actin are replaced by T199 and T201 in actin II and G200 and S202 in actin I. These changes decrease the hydrophobicity around the key-lock contact. The interaction is even weaker in F-actin I, caused by the replacement of I287 (in α-actin) by a V288 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S9 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Another intrastrand interaction is mediated by the D-loop in SD2; the D-loop interacts with the adjacent protomer <italic>via</italic> hydrophobic interactions and is indispensable for polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In most crystal structures, the D-loop is disordered. The D-loop in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actins differs from canonical actins by the substitution of four residues, R39, G41, V43, and G48 (in α-actins) by K40, P42, I44, and E49 (in actin I) or K39, P41, I43, and E48 (in actin II). The substitution of G48 (non-polar, neutral, no side chain) by E49 in actin I or E48 actin II (polar, negatively charged, large side chain) is the most significant change. In skeletal muscle α-actins, Y169 forms an N-H…π bond with the side chain of Q49 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], contributing to filament stability. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actins, the side chain of either E50 (F-actin I) or Q49 (F-actin II) is in an opposite orientation. Interestingly, the substitution of H40, V139, and A170 (canonical actins) by M40, I139, and V170 in actin II increases the hydrophobicity in actin II. Only one substitution exists between actin I and actin II, G43 in actin I, by a polar amino acid N42 in actin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The interstrand contacts involve principally electrostatic interactions between the plug region (SD3) and the SD2 of a protomer from the opposite strand. This interaction is structurally conserved. However, in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actins, the substitution of M269 in canonical actins by K270 (actin I) or R270 (actin II) inverts the electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). Previous studies on <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> actins showed that mutation of K270 to M increases the filament stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In actin II, R270 does not seem to cause shortening of the filaments. K270 in actin I increases the positive charge of the surface more than R270 in actin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). This could be a contributing factor to the actin II filaments being more stable than F-actin I. In addition to the electrostatic interaction of the plug, there are other residues involved in the interstrand contacts; H173 (SD3) and L113 (SD1) of one protomer with L39 (SD2) and the residues E195 and G269 (SD4) of the opposite protomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S10 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Long and stable actin filaments alone are not sufficient for oocyst development</title><p id="P19">Previously, we analyzed a chimeric actin where the D-loop of actin I was replaced with that of α-actin. <italic>In vitro</italic>, this chimeric actin, expressed in a heterologous system, formed long and stable filaments. We also generated a mutant expressing the chimera from the <italic>actin II</italic> locus in the <italic>actII(-)</italic> background. This mutant showed normal exflagellation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Here, we tested whether this mutant could form normal oocysts. Mosquitoes were fed on a mouse infected with this chimeric <italic>(actIchi)</italic> mutant, and midguts were dissected and labeled with an antibody against the oocyst capsule protein Cap380. This revealed that oocysts were formed, although in significantly reduced numbers compared to the WT. They remained small, and no sporozoites developed, thus resulting in a block in mosquito transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). Thus, for normal oocyst formation, also other specific features of actin II seem to be necessary, not simply the ability to form long and stable filaments.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>His73 is crucial for actin II function in oocyst development</title><p id="P20">From our earlier high-resolution structures (Vahokoski et a. 2014), we saw that unlike H74 in actin I, around 90% of actin II has a H73 methylation when expressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S11a and S12 Fig</xref>). Using Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), we confirmed that H73 is methylated in a significant fraction of actin II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S11b Fig</xref>), as is the case also in most canonical actins. Methylation of this histidine stabilizes the filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. In actin I, the so-called A-loop plays a role in defining filament length. In the proposed model, the A-loop undergoes a ping-pong movement between two positive charges, such that D180<sup>-</sup> interacts either with K270<sup>+</sup> or the unmethylated, protonated H74<sup>+</sup>, promoting and stable and unstable filament conformations, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. In the case of F-actin II, the A-loop has a conformation similar to canonical actins and the G-actin II structure, where D179 is oriented towards R177 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S13 Fig</xref>) and does not interact with the methylated H73. Thus, neither in the crystal structures of actin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] nor in the filament structures described here, the “unstable” conformation is detected.</p><p id="P21">To abolish the regulation by methylation, we introduced a point mutation in the <italic>actin II</italic> gene, obtaining the <italic>actIIH73Q</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S14 Fig</xref>). This mutant was able to normally form male gametes, as exflagellation took place and ookinete conversion was comparable to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a and 6b</xref>). Thus, a histidine at position 73 and its possible methylation are not important for the function of actin II in these early mosquito stages. Next, mice infected with WT and the mutant were offered to <italic>A. gambiae</italic> female mosquitoes. After 12-13 days, midguts were dissected and labeled for the oocyst capsule protein Cap380, and DNA was stained.

However, the mutant oocysts were significantly smaller than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d and Fig 6e</xref>). In addition, 80% of WT oocysts contained DNA, while only 42% of the mutant oocysts had visible DNA staining. In the mutant oocysts, no sporozoites were formed. To investigate this further, we allowed infected mosquitoes to feed on naïve mice. Giemsa-stained blood samples were observed from day five onwards. This revealed that, while in the WT strain infection was detectable at day five (two mice), we never detected any parasites in the mice bitten by the mosquitoes infected with <italic>actIIH73Q</italic> (five mice), even ten days after the mosquito feeding. Taken together, this shows that H73 and possibly its methylation in actin II are important for oocyst development, and that the mutant parasites were unable to form infectious sporozoites. This is similar to what we found for the <italic>actIchi</italic> mutant, although in that case, the oocyst phenotype was more severe.

The actin II polymerization curves exhibited an overshoot, which presents itself as a peak in the first 10 min of polymerization both in the presence and absence of seeds. The overshoot was less pronounced at lower actin concentrations and in the presence of actin II nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8f and 8g</xref>). This overshoot has also been reported for canonical actins and is related to fast ATP hydrolysis that causes partial depolymerization of the actin-ADP subunits at the pointed end of the filament.

Immunolabelling of samples obtained during the short time of gametocyte development (~10-15 min) revealed a dynamic pattern. In non-activated samples, actin II was mainly in the nucleus, but a cytoplasmic signal in the cell was also visible. This may indicate that it is directly involved in the rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the host cell membrane, consistent with the earlier finding that, in the <italic>actin II</italic> deletion mutant, rupture of the membranes was blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P35">In developing male gametocytes, mainly a diffuse signal was detected in the nucleus, but in rare occasions of cells fixed at 8 min p.a., actin II was seen as distinct dots or rods associated with the nucleus.

Another explanation for the filament length differences is a model based on fragmentation, proposed for actin I. In this model, filament stability is determined by the interactions of D180 in the A-loop with either K270 (plug) or H74 in the H-loop (depending on its protonation state).

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance statement</title></caption><p>Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., which belong to the phylum Apicomplexa. In 2020, approximately 627000 people died from nearly 241 million malaria cases registered worldwide. In contrast to other apicomplexan parasites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. encode two actin isoforms. While actin I is part of the glideosome complex, essential for locomotion, actin II is present in the mosquito stages, where it has functions in gametogenesis and in the zygote. The exact function of actin II is still unclear, and information at the molecular level is limited. We show here that actin II is associated with the nucleus in gametocytes and zygotes and performs specific functions requiring both long filaments and fine-tuning by methylation of histidine 73. We determined the structures of the filamentous form of actin II at near-atomic resolution and characterized its polymerization properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our study provides a molecular basis for the differences between actins of the malaria parasite and humans, as well as between the two parasite actin isoforms. Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies provide insights into the function of actin II in the parasite.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Expression of actin II in mosquito stages.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Western blot of crude extracts of gametocytes, zygotes, and ookinetes. <bold>1:</bold> mixed blood stages (containing asexual parasites and gametocytes); <bold>2:</bold> non-activated gametocytes; <bold>3:</bold> activated gametocytes; <bold>4:</bold> female gametes; <bold>5-8:</bold> zygotes; <bold>5:</bold> 1 h post activation (p.a.); <bold>6:</bold> 2 h p.a.; <bold>7:</bold> 3 h p.a.; <bold>8:</bold> 4 h p.a.; <bold>9:</bold> ookinetes.
