We demonstrate the feasibility of direct-LIVE-PAINT with an actin-binding peptide fused to EGFP, the location of which can be accurately determined as it transiently binds to actin filaments. We show that direct-LIVE-PAINT can be used to image actin structures below the diffraction-limit of light and have used it to observe the dynamic nature of actin in live cells.

In single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approaches, the spatiotemporal separation of individual emitters is achieved via the stochastic activation of fluorophores, each of which can be localized with nanometer accuracy (for a comprehensive review of techniques, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Horrocks et al., 2014</xref>). In points accumulation for imaging nanoscale topography (PAINT), fluorescent molecules temporarily bind to surfaces, such as membranes, and are localized allowing for SR imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Sharonov and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>). Since the initial demonstration of this strategy, variations on the method have been developed by several different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Whiten et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Sanders et al., 2022</xref>). DNA-PAINT has proven particularly useful and has been applied to imaging DNA origami arrays <italic>in vitro</italic>, and proteins in fixed samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). As DNA-PAINT relies on tagging biomolecules with unique oligonucleotide sequences, it can also be used for multiplexed imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>). An analogous approach, peptide-PAINT, has also been developed using peptide-peptide interaction pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Eklund et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The requirement for fixation and permeabilization, however, generally precludes the use of either DNA-PAINT or peptide-PAINT for live-cell imaging, although in some cases DNA-PAINT has been used to image membrane proteins on the outer surface of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Strauss et al., 2018</xref>). To circumvent the limitation of cell fixation and permeabilization, we recently developed LIVE-PAINT (Live cell Imaging using reVersible intEractions-PAINT), a method that uses transient protein-protein interactions to perform SR imaging in live cells (Oi et al., 2020). In this approach, the protein-of-interest is genetically fused to a short peptide sequence, and a SR image is generated as this is transiently bound by an interacting peptide fused to a fluorescent protein (Oi et al., 2020). While useful for imaging targets in live cells, the LIVE-PAINT technique has only been demonstrated in live yeast, and also requires the modification of the target protein, which may perturb its structure and function. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce direct-LIVE-PAINT. Rather than relying on tagging the protein-of-interest with a peptide sequence, direct-LIVE-PAINT uses genetically-encoded fluorescent peptides that directly interact with the unmodified, endogenous protein, enabling SR imaging in live mammalian cells.</p><p id="P4">Actin is an abundant protein that is a component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Its dynamic conversion between the monomeric (G-actin) and the filamentous (F-actin) state underlies key cellular functions. New ways to image F-actin in live cells are especially useful, since when directly fused to a fluorescent protein, actin is not fully functional. One probe, termed LifeAct, uses the N-terminal 17 amino acids of an actin-binding protein Abp140 fused to EGFP to label actin. Although widely used to label actin in live and fixed cells, artifacts have been noted with LifeAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kiuchi et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Flores et al., 2019</xref>). Most notably, it has been reported that LifeAct exhibits a higher affinity for G-actin than for F-actin and that this differential affinity perturbs the equilibrium, causing artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Courtemanche et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Flores et al., 2019</xref>). Kumari et al. recently reported that a peptide lacking the C-terminal 3 amino acids of LifeAct, which they named LifeAct-14, binds to F-actin with similar affinity (K<sub>D</sub>=1.2 μM) to LifeAct, and does not exhibit preferential binding to G-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kumari et al., 2020</xref>). They therefore reasoned it would be less perturbing to cellular function (actin assembly) than LifeAct itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Based on its low micromolar affinity and negligible perturbative effects, we postulated that expression of LifeAct-14-EGFP fusion could be used to obtain SR images of filamentous actin via the direct-LIVE-PAINT approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As with LIVE-PAINT, we show that direct-LIVE-PAINT is dependent on the concentration of the labeled peptide and determine the optimum expression conditions for LifeAct-14-EGFP in HEK-293 cells. We also demonstrate that it is possible to image the dynamic actin structure in live cells, achieving a spatial resolution of 80 nm, with a temporal resolution of 12.5 s. By enabling the tracking of actin dynamics in live cells, we believe that direct-LIVE-PAINT with LifeAct-14-EGFP will serve as a valuable tool to improve our current understanding of the role played by the cytoskeleton in motility, adhesion and other cellular processes. Furthermore, direct-LIVE-PAINT presents a method for probing a range of biomolecules in SR, provided the peptide has suitable binding kinetics for the target-of-interest.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transfection of LifeAct-14-EGFP allows the super-resolution imaging of actin</title><p id="P6">As with any SMLM-based technique, the success of direct-LIVE-PAINT relies on having the optimum levels of active fluorophore to enable spatiotemporal separation. We therefore investigated how varying the transfection levels of LifeAct-14-EGFP affected our ability to distinguish individual fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). At low transfection levels (0.032-0.8 ng DNA), negligible binding was observed. At higher concentrations (4 ng DNA), however, we observed transient binding of LifeAct-14-EGFP, allowing the localization of individual emitters (54k locs). At higher concentrations still (20 ng DNA), the binding rate increased, leading to higher density SR images (186k localizations) and clear filament structure (spatial resolution of 100 nm as determined by Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC)) (ten Brink, T. RustFRC [Computer software]). At higher expression levels (100 ng DNA) however, individual binding events could no longer be observed due to saturation of the actin-binding sites with LifeAct-14-EGFP. Based on these observations, a transfection concentration of 20 ng was optimum for LifeAct-14-EGFP in live HEK-293 cells. The images at each transfection amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) are representative examples seen in ~60-70% of the transfected cell population (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Actin filaments in live cells are dynamic structures</title><p id="P7">Actin is a key component of the cytoskeleton and is responsible for maintaining cell structure and shape. Due to the non-perturbative nature of direct-LIVE-PAINT, and its ability to image in live cells, we used it to track the dynamics of actin filaments.</p><p id="P8">The spatial resolution of images generated using SMLM is dependent on both the precision of each emitter localized, and the density of the localizations. To achieve the highest resolution, it can therefore be necessary to image over several minutes, resulting in the loss of temporal resolution. Thus, there is a compromise to be made between achieving the highest spatial and temporal resolution. We therefore investigated how the imaging time affected the spatial resolution of direct-LIVE-PAINT by analyzing subsets of frames generated from LifeAct-14-EGFP binding to actin in live HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We set a more stringent precision threshold (&lt; 20 nm) to determine whether spatial resolution improves, while still detecting sufficient localizations to discern filament structure. With increasing imaging time (example images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), the spatial resolution increased from ~100 nm to 80 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), and more detail was evident in the images. As localizations were accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), clearer structure was observed. At higher integration times, the resolution appeared to plateau. To increase the number of localizations further, we applied a less stringent precision threshold (&lt; 30 nm). Although this reduces the spatial resolution (80 nm to 100 nm), the increase in the number of localizations (60k vs 186k) allowed the movement of filaments to be visualized at a time-resolution of 12.5 s. Indeed, this can be observed in the time-montage of the direct-LIVE-PAINT images in a ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), where the filament (dashed white box) clearly changes in shape over 50 s. The SR plot in which the localizations were colored according to the time they were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) further illustrates this behavior; the dynamics of the same filament (red box) can be observed throughout the imaging time-course.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P9">In summary, we demonstrate that direct-LIVE-PAINT can be used to probe protein targets in live cells.
