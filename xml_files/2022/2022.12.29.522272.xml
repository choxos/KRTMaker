Our understanding of biochemical constraints for mitochondrial activation is limited. Using a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> screen, we identified the conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (Usp10), as necessary for mitochondrial repression. Ubp3 mutants have increased mitochondrial activity despite abundant glucose, along with decreased glycolytic enzymes, and a rewired glucose metabolic network with increased trehalose production. Utilizing <italic>Δubp3</italic> cells, along with orthogonal approaches, we establish that the high glycolytic flux in glucose continuously consumes free Pi. This restricts mitochondrial access to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and prevents mitochondrial activation. Contrastingly, rewired glucose metabolism with enhanced trehalose production and reduced GAPDH (as in <italic>Δubp3</italic> cells) restores Pi. This collectively results in increased mitochondrial Pi and derepression, while restricting mitochondrial Pi transport prevents activation. We therefore suggest that glycolytic-flux dependent intracellular Pi budgeting is a key constraint for mitochondrial repression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>phosphate</kwd><kwd>deubiquitinase</kwd><kwd>Crabtree</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rapidly proliferating cells have substantial metabolic and energy demands in order to increase biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cai and Tu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>). This includes a high ATP demand, obtained from cytosolic glycolysis or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to fuel multiple reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, many rapidly proliferating cells preferentially rely on ATP from glycolysis/fermentation over mitochondrial respiration even in oxygen-replete conditions, and is the well-known Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Warburg, 1925</xref>). Many such cells repress mitochondrial processes in high glucose, termed glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression or the Crabtree effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Crabtree, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">De Deken, 1966</xref>). This is observed in some tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Xia et al., 2021</xref>), activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kornberg, 2020</xref>), stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abdel-Haleem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pacini and Borziani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tsogtbaatar et al., 2020</xref>), and famously <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">De Deken, 1966</xref>). Numerous studies have identified signaling programs or regulators of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression. However, biochemical programs and regulatory processes in biology evolve around key biochemical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cornish-Bowden, 2016</xref>). The biochemical constraints for mitochondrial repression remain unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">There are two hypotheses on the biochemical principles driving mitochondrial repression. The first proposes direct roles for glycolytic intermediates in driving mitochondrial respiration, by inhibiting specific mitochondrial outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). The second hypothesizes that a competition between glycolytic and mitochondrial processes for mutually required metabolites/co-factors such as pyruvate, ADP or inorganic phosphate (Pi) could determine the extent of mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>). These are not all mutually exclusive, and a combination of these factors might dictate mitochondrial repression in high glucose. However, any hierarchies of importance are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>), and experimental data for the necessary constraints for mitochondrial repression remains incomplete.</p><p id="P4">One approach to resolve this question has been to identify regulators of metabolic state under high glucose. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulated by signaling systems can regulate mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hitosugi and Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tripodi et al., 2015</xref>). Ubiquitination is a PTM that regulates global proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>), but the roles of ubiquitination-dependent processes in regulating mitochondrial repression are poorly explored. Ubiquitination itself is determined by the balance between ubiquitination, and deubiquitinase (DUB) dependent deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pickart and Eddins, 2004</xref>). Little is known about the roles of DUBs in regulating metabolic states, making the DUBs interesting candidate regulators of mitochondrial repression.</p><p id="P5">In this study, using an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DUB knock-out library-based screen, we identified the evolutionarily conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (mammalian Usp10) as required for mitochondrial repression in high glucose. Loss of Ubp3 resulted in mitochondrial activation, along with a reduction in the glycolytic enzymes-phosphofructokinase 1 (Pfk1) and GAPDH (Tdh2 and Tdh3). This consequently reroutes glucose flux and increases trehalose biosynthesis. This metabolic rewiring increases Pi release from trehalose synthesis, and decreases Pi consumption in glycolysis, to cumulatively increase Pi pools. Using <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells along with independent analysis of wild-type cells, and isolated mitochondrial fractions, we establish that glycolytic-flux dependent Pi allocations to mitochondria determines mitochondrial activity. Through these data, we propose how intracellular Pi balance as controlled by glycolytic flux, is a biochemical constraint for mitochondrial repression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A deubiquitinase deletion screen identifies Ubp3 as a regulator of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression</title><p id="P6">In cells such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, high glucose represses mitochondrial activity as well as OXPHOS-dependent ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">De Deken, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Postma et al., 1989</xref>) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our initial objective was to identify proteostasis regulators of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression. We generated and used a deubiquitinase (DUB) deletion strain library of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>), to unbiasedly identify regulators of mitochondrial repression by measuring the fluorescence intensity of a potentiometric dye Mitotracker CMXRos (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using this screen, we identified DUB mutants with altered mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1 A</xref>). Note: WT cells in a respiratory medium (2% ethanol) were used as a control to estimate maximum mitotracker fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">A prominent ‘hit’ was the evolutionarily conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), (homologous to mammalian Usp10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Due to its high degree of conservation across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>) as well as putative roles in metabolism or mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nostramo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>), we focused our further attention on this DUB. Cells lacking Ubp3 showed an ~1.5-fold increase in mitotracker fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). Cells with catalyticaly inactive Ubp3 (Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup>), showed increased mitochondrial potential comparable to <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This data confirmed that Ubp3 catalytic activity of is required to fully repress mitochondrial activity under high glucose. The catalytic site mutation did not affect steady-state Ubp3 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, to assess the requirement of Ubp3 for mitochondrial function, we quantified the electron transport chain (ETC) complex IV subunit Cox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fontanesi et al., 2006</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> had higher Cox2 than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). As a control, we estimated total mitochondrial content in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, using either estimates of the structural protein Tom70, or measuring the fluorescence-intensity in strains engineered with mitochondrial targeted mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dua et al., 2022</xref>). There was no increase in the total mitochondrial volume (estimated by measuring the intensity of mitochondria targeted mNeon green) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F</xref>) or mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1G</xref>). This suggests that the increased Cox2 is not merely because of higher total mitochondrial content. We next measured the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, and basal OCR was higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, indicating higher respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we asked if mitochondrial ATP synthesis was higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. The total ATP levels in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, upon treatment with the ETC complex IV inhibitor sodium azide, ATP levels in WT were higher than <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, contributing to ~60% of the total ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, the ATP levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> after sodium azide treatment were ~ 40% of the total ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest a higher contribution of mitochondrial ATP synthesis towards the total ATP pool in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>.</p><p id="P10">We next asked if <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> required higher mitochondrial activity for growth, using a series of mitochondrial activity inhibitors and comparing relative growth. In high glucose, WT cells show minimal growth inhibition in the presence of sodium azide, indicating lower reliance on mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Contrastingly, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> or Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> show a severe growth defect in the presence of the mitochondrial ETC complex inhbitors sodium azide and oligomycin, and the mitochondrial OXPHOS uncoupler FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1H</xref>). Additionally, the loss of Ubp3 in respiration defective cox2-62 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bonnefoy et al., 2001</xref>), or Rho0 cells (which lacks mitochondrial DNA) resulted in a severe growth defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Deletion of ATP synthase subunits Atp1 and Atp10 also results in a severe growth defect in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the loss of Ubp3 makes cells dependent on mitochondrial ATP synthesis in high glucose.</p><p id="P11">In order to address whether the deletion of Ubp3 might increase ubiquitinated proteins and consequent proteostatic stress, we analysed the global ubquitination state in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells grown under brief (1 hour) heat stress, which increases protein ubiquitination, was used as a control. However, we did not observe a significant increase in the global ubiqutinatin state in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 1-figure supplement 1J</xref>). This suggests that the altered mitochondrial metabolism in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells is unlikely to be due to proteostatic stress.</p><p id="P12">Collectively these data show that in 2% glucose, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> have high mitochondrial activity, respiration, and rely on this mitochondrial function for ATP production and growth. We therefore decided to use <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells to start delineating requirements for glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Key glycolytic enzymes decrease and glucose flux is rerouted in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells</title><p id="P13">Glucose-6 phosphate (G6P) is the central node in glucose metabolism where carbon-allocations are made towards distinct metabolic arms, primarily: glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and trehalose biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first compared amounts of two key (‘rate-controling’) glycolytic enzymes - Phosphofructokinase 1 (Pfk1), GAPDH isozymes (Tdh2, Tdh3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>), along with the enolase isozymes (Eno1, Eno2) in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. Pfk1, Tdh2, and Tdh3 substantially decreased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (but not Eno1 and Eno2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since deubiquitinases can control protein amounts by regulating proteasomal degradation, we asked if the decrease in Pfk1, Tdh2 and Tdh3 in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> is due to proteasomal degradation. To test this, we measured the levels of these enzymes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> after treatement with proteasomal inhibitor MG132. We did not observe any rescue in the levels of these enzymes in MG132 treated samples, suggesting that the decreased levels of these enzymes were not due to increased proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further understand if these enzyme transcripts are altered in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, we measured the mRNA levels of PFK1, TDH2 and TDH3 in WT, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> cells. The transcripts of all the three genes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> cells decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that Ubp3 regulates the transcripts of these glycolytic enzyme genes. The reduction in the Pfk and GAPDH enzyme amounts was intriguing, because the Pfk and GAPDH steps are critical in determining glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Shestov et al., 2014</xref>). A reduction in these enzymes could therefore decrease glycolytic flux, and would reroute glucose (G6P) allocations via mass action towards other branches of glucose metabolism, primarily the pentose phosphate pathway as well as trehalose biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To assess this, we first measured the steady-state levels of key glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates, and trehalose in WT or <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> using targeted LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Glucose-6/fructose-6 phosphate (G6P/F6P) increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Concurrently, trehalose, and the PPP intermediates ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P), increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Since steady-state metabolite amounts cannot separate production from utilization, in order to unambiguously assess if glycolytic flux is reduced in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, we utilized a pulse labeling of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, following which the label incorporation into glycolytic and other intermediates was measured. Note that because glycolytic flux is very high in yeast, this experiment would require rapid pulsing and extraction of metabolites in order to stay in a linear range and avoid label saturation. We therefore established a very short time point of label-addition, quenching and metabolite extraction post <sup>13</sup>C glucose pulse. Since flux saturates/reaches steady-state in seconds, we first ensured that the label incorporation into individual metabolites after the <sup>13</sup>C glucose pulse was in the linear range, and for early glycolytic intermediates this was seconds after glucose addition. This new methodology is extensively described in materials and methods, with required controls shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1F</xref>. WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into glycolytic intermediates and trehalose were measured, as shown in the schematic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 1E</xref>). In <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into G6P/F6P as well as trehalose substantially increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Contrastingly, <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into glycolytic intermediates F1,6BP, G3P, 3PG and PEP decreased, indicating decreased glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We next measured ethanol concentrations and production rates, as an additional output of relative glycolytic rates. We observed decreased steady-state ethanol levels, as well as ethanol production rates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Glycolysis-derived pyruvate is transported to mitochondria and fuels the TCA cycle. Therefore, we asked if the decreased glycolytic rate result in a decrease in the TCA cycle flux as well. To test this, we first measured the steady state levels of TCA cycle intermediates in WT or <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> using targeted LC-MS/MS. We did not observe any significant change in the levels of TCA cycle intermediates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, except malate which showed a significant decrease in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, in order to assess if TCA cycle flux reduces in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates was measured, as shown in the schematic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). The kinetics of <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in TCA cycle intermediates are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 2-figure supplement 2C</xref>. We did not observe any significant change in the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in TCA cycle intermediates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. Therefore, these data suggest that the decreased glycolytic flux in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> does not result in a decrease in TCA cycle flux. The increased respiration and mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells is therefore driven via other factors.</p><p id="P16">Collectively, these results reveal that that reduced Pfk1 and GAPDH (in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>) decrease glucose flux via glycolysis, which results in rewired glucose flux towards trehalose biosynthesis and the PPP.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Rerouted glucose flux results in phosphate (Pi) accumulation</title><p id="P17">We therefore asked if the proteomic state, as observed in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, could provide clues to explain the coupling between mitochondrial derepression and rerouted glucose flux. A recent study by Isasa et al., had systematically quantified the changes in protein levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore reanalyzed this extensive dataset, looking for changes in proteins that would correlate with these metabolic processes. Notably, we observed increased levels of proteins of the mitochondrial ETC and respiration, and decreased amounts of glucose metabolizing enzymes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, multiple proteins involved in regulating phosphate (Pi) homeostasis were decreased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>). We had recently uncovered a reciprocal coupling of Pi homeostasis with the different arms of glucose metabolism, particularly trehalose biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>), and therefore wondered if a glycolytic-flux dependent change in Pi homeostatsis had any role in mitochondrial respiration. Our hypothesis was refined based on the reasoning given below.</p><p id="P18">One explanation for mitochondrial repression can be an internal competition for shared metabolites/co-factors between (cytosolic) glycolytic and mitochondrial processes, that mitochondria might not be sufficiently able to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). In this context, a plausible role for inorganic phosphate (Pi) in regulating mitochondrial repression can be hypothesized. Cytosolic glycolysis requires rapid, high consumption of net Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mason et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>), and this could possibly limit the Pi that is continuously available for mitochondrial use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brazy et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>), thereby repressing mitochondria. Contextually, the balance between reactions releasing vs consuming Pi could explain changes in global Pi levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>). A continuous hub of Pi consumption is glycolysis. Here, GAPDH catalyzes G3P to 1,3BPG, converting ADP to ATP, while concurrently consuming a molecule of Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). This Pi that goes into ATP will subsequently be used for nucleotide biosynthesis, polyphosphate biosynthesis and protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hunter, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we can surmise that in high glycolytic flux, the production of ATP, nucleotides and polyphosphates is concurrent with Pi consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Austin and Mayer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). Could this reaction therefore limit cytosolic Pi for the mitochondria (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>)?

Therefore, these cells might have increased Pi release (via trehalose), coupled with decreased Pi consumption (via decreased GAPDH).

Further, upon shifting to low Pi for one hour, Pho84 and Pho12 increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. These data suggest that reduced Pho84 and Pho12 amounts in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> are because of increased Pi, and not due to altered Pho regulon function itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data clarify earlier observations from <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> which noted reduced Pho proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>).

In WT yeast, low glucose or glycolytic inhibition will result in increased respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broach, 2012</xref>). What happens therefore if we restrict mitochondrial Pi in this context? For this, we measured the basal OCR in WT and <italic>mir1Δ</italic> after switching from high (2%) to low (0.1%) glucose. We observed a significant increase in the basal OCR in WT but not in <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The alternate scenario is after glycolytic inhibition. We assessed the role of mitochondrial Pi in this context, by inhibiting glycolysis using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). WT, but not <italic>mir1Δ</italic>, increased their OCR (respiration) upon a 1-hour treatment with 2DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with this, mitotracker fluorescence increased with an increase in 2DG in WT, but not in <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further asked if the mitochondrial Pi transporter itself glucose repressed, and therefore assessed Mir1 amounts in high and low glucose. Mir1 levels are higher upon a shift to low glucose, and in cells grown in 2% ethanol, suggesting that Mir1 is glucose repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that mitochondrial Pi transport is necessary for increasing mitochondrial activity after glucose derepression.</p><p id="P30">We next asked whether just adding external Pi was sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity, when cells are in high glucose. In medium supplemented with excess Pi, the internal Pi increases as seen earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, a simplistic assumption would be that the addition of external Pi to cells in high glucose would also increase mitochondrial Pi. However, an alternate possibility presents itself whererin since glycolytic flux is already high in glucose, supplementing Pi will continue to fuel glycolysis. Indeed, this was originally obseved by Harden and Young in 1908, where adding Pi increased fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Harden and Young, 1906</xref>). In such a scenario, there could be an increase in the cytosolic Pi but not the mitochondrial Pi. We estimated the cytosolic and mitochondrial Pi in this condition where excess Pi was externally supplemented. Notably, cells grown in high Pi had increased cytosolic Pi, but decreased mitochondrial Pi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>), without any changes in total mitochondria volume or amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, directly adding Pi to cells growing in high glucose also decreased basal OCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with decreased mitochondrial Pi. These data indicate that in high glucose, simply supplementing Pi will not increase Pi access to the mitochondria, and instead results in an accumulation of Pi in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore now asked, if we inhibit glycolytic flux and then supplement Pi, what would happen to mitochondrial activity. For this, we treated cells with 2DG, and subsequently added Pi and measured the OCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1F</xref>). In this case, supplementing Pi increased the basal OCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that a combination of decreasing glycolysis and increasing Pi can together increase respiration. Next, in order to directly test mitochondrial activation based on external Pi availability, we isolated mitochondria, and estimated activity <italic>in vitro</italic> upon adding increasing Pi. Mitochondrial activity increased with increased Pi, with maximum activity observed with 25 mM Pi supplemented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In a complementary experiment, we overexpressed the Mir1 transporter in wild-type cells, to increase Pi within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Such reallocations of glucose flux will collectively increase overall Pi, coming from the combined effect of increased Pi release from trehalose synthesis, and decreased Pi consumption via reduced GAPDH.

This approach negates nuanced investigations, since metabolic enzymes are often essential for viability. Furthermore, metabolic pathways have multiple, contextually regulated nodes, through which cells maintain their metabolic state.

In this study of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression, the loss of the DUB Ubp3 decreases glycolytic flux by reducing the enzymes at two critical nodes in the pathway - Pfk1 and GAPDH.

Additionally, cells might control Pi allocations for different reactions via compartmentalizing Pi in organelles, to spatially restrict Pi availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Booth and Guidotti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Solesio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Vila et al., 2022</xref>). Our data collectively suggest a paradigm where the combination of factors regulates mitochondrial Pi and thereby activity. In glycolytic yeast cells growing in high glucose, mitochondrial Pi availability becomes restricted due to higher utilization of Pi in glycolysis compared to mitochondria. Consistent with this, a rapid decrease in Pi upon glucose addition has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). Interesting, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with isolated mitochondria from tumor cells also find that decreasing Pi levels decreases respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>), which would be consistent with this scenario. Further, supplementing Pi correlates with decreased mitochondrial repression in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brin and McKee, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>). By increasing Pi through a systems-level rewiring of glucose metabolism (such as in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells), cells can collectively increase mitochondrial access to Pi. This Pi budgeting determines mitochondrial activity. Supplementing Pi under conditions of low glycolysis (where mitochondrial Pi transport is enhanced), as well as directly supplementing Pi to isolated mitochondria, increases respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, this increased respiration does not happen upon directly supplementing Pi to highly glycolytic WT cells, where the Pi increases in cytosol, without increasing mitochondrial Pi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, in order to derepress mitochondria, a combination of increased Pi along with decreased glycolysis is required. An additional systems-level phenomenon that might regulate Pi transport to the mitochondria is the decrease in cytosolic pH upon decreased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Orij et al., 2011</xref>). The cytosolic pH in highly glycolytic cells is ~7, and decreasing glycolysis results in cytosolic acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Orij et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (2DG treatment, deletion of Ubp3, and decreased GAPDH activity), cytosolic pH becomes acidic. Since mitochondrial Pi transport itself is dependent on the proton gradient, a low cytosolic pH would favour mitochondrial Pi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hamel et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (2DG treatment, or loss of Ubp3, or decreased GAPDH activity), where cytosolic pH would be acidic, increasing cytosolic Pi might indirectly increase mitochondria Pi transport, thereby leading to increased respiration. Alternately, increasing mitochondrial Pi transporter amounts can achieve the same result, as seen by overexpressing Mir1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A similar observation has been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, reiterating an evolutionarily conserved role for mitochondrial Pi in controlling respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). Relatedly, glycolytic inhibition can suppress cell proliferation in Warburg-positive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">O’Neill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pelicano et al., 2006</xref>), or inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Soto-Heredero et al., 2020</xref>). However, these cells survive by switching to mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Shiratori et al., 2019</xref>), requiring alternate approaches to prevent their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibiting mitochondrial Pi transport in combination with glycolytic inhibition could restrict the proliferation of Warburg/Crabtree positive cells. It is important to highlight that our experiments, whether involving Pi supplementation or Pi limitations, maintain the cellular Pi concentration within the millimolar range, and are conducted within a short timeframe (~ 1 hour). This differs significantly from Pi starvation studies, where cells are subjected to prolonged and complete Pi deprivation. In those contexts, cells trigger extensive metabolic adaptations in order to sustain available Pi pools including an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential which can be independent of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ouyang et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Since its discovery in the 1920s, the phenomenon of accelerated glycolysis with concurrent mitochondrial repression has been intensely researched. Yet, the biochemical constraints for glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression remains unresolved. One hypothesis suggests that the availability of glycolytic intermediates might determine the extent of mitochondrial repression. F1,6BP inhibits complex III and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC) in Crabtree positive yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the ratio between G6P and F1,6BP regulates the extent of mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). Although G6P/F6P accumulates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), this is not the case in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> (GAPDH mutant) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that G6P/F6P accumulation in itself is not the criterion to increase mitochondrial activity. Separately, the competition for common metabolites/co-factors between glycolysis and respiration (such as ADP, Pi or pyruvate) could drive this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koobs, 1972</xref>). Here we observe that Mpc3 mediated mitochondrial pyruvate transport alone cannot increase respiration. An additional consideration is the possible contribution of changes in ADP in regulating mitochondrial activity, where the use of ADP in glycolysis might limit mitochondrial ADP. Therefore, when Pi changes as a consequence of glycolysis, it coud be imagined that a change in ADP balance can coincidentally occur. However, prior studies show that even though cytosolic ADP decreases in the presence of glucose, this does not limit mitochondrial ADP uptake, or decrease respiration, due to the very high affinity of the mitochondrial ADP transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). These collectively reiterate the importance of Pi access and transport to mitochondria in constraining mitochondrial respiration. Indeed, this interpretation can also contextually explain observations from other model systems where mitochondrial Pi transport seems to regulate respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Scheibye-Knudsen and Quistorff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Seifert et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P40">We parsimoniously suggest that Pi access to the mitochondria as a key constraint for mitochondrial repression under high glucose. In a hypothetical scenario, a single-step event in evolution, reducing mitochondrial Pi transporter amounts, and/or increasing glycolytic flux (to deplete cytosolic Pi), will result in whole-scale metabolic rewiring to repress mitochondria. More elaborate regulatory events can easily be imagined as subsequent adaptations to enforce mitochondrial repression. Given the central role played by Pi, something as fundamental as access to Pi will constrain mitochondrial repression. Concurrently, the rapid incorporation of Pi into faster glycolysis can give cells a competitive advantage, while also sequestering Pi in the form of usable ATP. Over the course of evolution, this could conceivably drive other regulatory mechanisms to enforce mitochondrial repression, leading to the currently observed complex regulatory networks and signaling programs observed in the Crabtree effect, and other examples of glucose-dependent mitochondrial repression.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Statistics and graphing</title><p id="P41">Unless otherwise indicated, statistical significance for all indicated experiments were calculated using unpaired Student’s t-tests (GraphPad prism 9.0.1).

In high glucose, the decreased Pi due to high Pi consumption in glycolysis, along with the glucose-mediated repression of mitochondrial Pi transporters, decreases mitochondrial Pi availability. This reduces mitochondrial activity. In low glucose, increased mitochondrial Pi transporters and lower glycolytic flux increases mitochondrial Pi, leading to enhanced mitochondrial activity. In <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells in high glucose, high trehalose synthesis and lower glycolytic flux results in an increase in Pi.
