The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) regulates ER activity by inducing DSB at ER enhancers. To delineate how A3B recognises its substrates and unveil the underlying mechanism leading to the formation of ER-induced DSB, we sampled A3B-mediated deamination sites using whole genome sequencing in a human breast cancer cell model lacking base excision repair function. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that C&gt;U conversions carried out by A3B in R-loop structures are processed into DSB in the vicinity of ER promoters or enhancers. A mechanism which required both the processing of A3B-editing sites and R-loops by distinct DNA damage repair mechanisms. In addition, using BioID-enabled mass-spectroscopy proteomics, we identified TDRD3 as a key A3B-binding partner directing the activity of A3B to ER-induced R-loops. This study suggests a function for A3B in sustaining tumour evolution as an adaptive response at the transcriptional and epigenetic level and supports A3B as a promising target to control ER activity in cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>APOBEC3B</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>R-loop</kwd><kwd>TDRD3</kwd><kwd>DNA deamination</kwd><kwd>double-strand break</kwd><kwd>DNA damage repair</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Estrogen (17-β E2; E2) is a hormone that is essential for the development and maintenance of the human reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Prolonged exposure to E2 contributes to the development of breast, ovarian and uterine cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. E2 binds and activates the two estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms, ERα (<italic>ESR1</italic>) and β (<italic>ESR2</italic>) which are expressed in different tissues, but can form both homo- and heterodimers when co-expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Upon E2 binding, ER translocates to the nucleus and acts as a key transcription factor by recognising E2 responsive elements (EREs) in genomic DNA. Translocation of ER to the nucleus and binding of ER to EREs leads to altered gene expression of thousands of downstream genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The gene set regulated by ER activation encompasses genes encoding essential reproductive functions, including cell proliferation and survival, and is linked to cancer development when ER is inappropriately activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition to this role as a regulator of gene expression, ER can also promote the development of cancer by inducing DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In ER-expressing breast epithelial cells, short-term stimulation by E2 triggers the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, which contributes to chromosome instability and aneuploidy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Increased genomic damage is particularly apparent in ER-positive breast cancers, where there is a high degree of chromosome instability characterized by mutations, gene copy number alterations and recombinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesised that ER-induced DNA damage is pivotal to the activity of ER since the DNA repair pathway elements not only participate and promote transcription activation, as exemplified by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, but also foster favourable conditions for transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> such as DNA demethylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, chromatin remodelling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and enhancer-associated RNA (eRNA) synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To date, several models have been proposed to account for the generation of E2-induced DSBs, including: the action of DNA topoisomerase IIβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, formation and processing of co-transcriptional R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and DNA damage triggered by deamination editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In recent years there has been particular interest in the role of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3B, A3B) and its role in multiple human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A3B is a member of the APOBEC3 enzyme family, which comprises seven closely related DNA deaminases that catalyse cytosine-to-uracil (C&gt;U) editing of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or RNA. In addition to their normal functions as immune defences against DNA viruses and transposons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, APOBEC3 catalytic activity has been reported to drive genetic heterogeneity in breast cancer by inducing C&gt;T transitions and C&gt;G transversions at 5’TCW motifs (W = A or T)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Although mounting evidence is pointing APOBEC3A, a highly homologous enzyme to C-terminal A3B, as the main contributor to APOBEC-driven mutation burden and cancer evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, A3B-driven cytidine deamination still has a prominent role in cancer due to two facts. First, as the only nuclear-localised member of the APOBEC3 family, elevated A3B expression is reported in &gt;50% of primary breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; and secondly, A3B binds directly to ERα and edits ER binding sites, which triggers DNA damage response (DDR) and are then processed by DNA base excision repair (BER) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) into DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The right amount of DSBs, together with the subsequent epigenetic modifications, determines the transactivation activity of ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Loss of functional A3B ablates ER-driven cell proliferation and prolongs the therapeutic benefit of tamoxifen in ER-positive xenograft models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These data support A3B as a regulator of ER, and also as a promising target to tackle drug resistance in ER-targeting therapies.</p><p id="P5">Elevated transcriptional activity leads to the formation of chromatin-associated R-loop structures, which are formed by re-annealing of nascent RNA with the transcribed strand of DNA and results in a three-stranded structure consisting of a DNA:RNA hybrid and a displaced ssDNA strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown that clearance of co-transcriptionally formed R-loops by DDR machinery is a main source of DSBs caused by ER activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Since the displaced ssDNA in R-loops could serve as a substrate for A3B, it has been proposed that A3B could be involved in R-loop-associated functions. This hypothesis is supported by the use of APOBEC-Cas9 engineered system as tools to edit R-loop DNA cytosines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and the fact that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the APOBEC/AID deaminases family, edits R-loops to facilitate antibody gene hypermutation and class switch recombination in B lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. More recently, A3B has been found to influence R-loop homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. However, despite these endeavours, it is unknown whether R-loop editing by A3B is directly associated with its function as an ER coactivator.</p><p id="P6">An ideal way to address the potential role of R-loop editing by A3B on the co-activation of ER-regulated transcription is to sample A3B editing sites on a large scale using ER-dependent models. This approach would reveal potential hot spots of A3B editing, which could be used to infer the mechanism that governs A3B-dependent DNA editing and point to how A3B regulates ER activity. Large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies performed on cell lines and primary samples have identified sites of APOBEC editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, these studies may be confounded by a ‘survivorship bias’ where the detected A3B-edited sites are limited to those that were not repaired by DDR, as it is known that BER removes U:G mispairing resulting from A3B editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This caveat may also affect studies employing A3B-overexpression cell models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To circumvent this, we sampled A3B editing sites using an engineered BER-deficient breast cancer cellular model and used a multi-omic approach to elucidate the role of A3B in the molecular mechanism of ER-regulated gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Detection of A3B deamination sites using a BER-deficient human breast cancer cell model</title><p id="P7">In order to capture A3B deamination sites that may have a functional impact on protein coding or regulatory DNA sequences, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ER-positive T-47D human breast cancer cells co-expressing doxycycline-inducible A3B. and humanised bacteriophage PBS2 uracil glycosylase inhibitor (hUGI) peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel) to inhibit the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG/UNG) and prevent excision of the A3B-catalysed uracil bases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The T-47D cell line was chosen because it does not express APOBEC3A which may confound the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and also carries a loss-of-function <italic>TP53</italic> mutation that is known to protect the cells from the synthetic lethality caused by ectopic expression of A3B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. After confirming the inducible expression of A3B/hUGI by immunoblotting, we exposed the cells to doxycycline for five days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>), and sequenced genomic DNA samples from five individual T-47D clones (A+ colonies). As controls, sequencing results from three un-induced colonies (A- colonies) and three T-47D colonies (M+ colonies) co-expressing hUGI and enzymatically-dead A3B E68Q/E255Q double mutant (A3B**)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> were used to represent single-nucleotide variants (SNV) arising either from the clonal separation process or base-editing by endogenous ABOBEC/AID-family enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Joint mutation calling by the GATK4 computational programme was carried out using a parental T-47D reference sample, the result of which showed a significantly elevated proportion of non-CpG C&gt;T mutations in the A+ colonies over the M+ and A- colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next assessed the extent of focal hyper-mutation among the detected mutations using both intermutational distance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>) and an algorithm that detects somatic local hyper-mutation (HyperClust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Unlike previous studies, where kataegis-like mutation clusters were prevalent in BER-functional models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, fewer clustered mutational events were detected in A+ colonies where BER activities were suppressed by hUGI. However, A+ colonies contained more non-recurrent and diffused form of clustered mutation termed omikli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of the resulting SNVs against pre-defined COSMIC single-base substitution (SBS) signatures (version 2) using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> identified the enrichment of signature SBS2 which was attributed to the activities of AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> NMF signature extraction revealed two prevalent signatures among the sequenced control colonies: signature A which is more prevalent in A-/M+ colonies and might account for the variation among T-47D subclones, and signature B which is mostly enriched in A+ colonies and harbours the A3B-preferred 3’-TCW trinucleotide motif, resembling the mutational process attributed to A3B editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Notably, other than C&gt;T substitutions, a very weak contribution by C&gt;A and C&gt;G substitutions at the 5’-TC motif were observed in signature B, suggesting that most of the A3B-mediated uridine sites were subjected to BER processing. In addition, both SBS2 and signature B are also found in M+ colonies, but enriched to a much lesser extent, implying the capture of intrinsic APOBEC/AID-family-mediated mutations by BER blockade. These data demonstrated that the BER-deficient breast cancer model successfully preserves and captures A3B activity on genomic DNA in the absence of the interference of downstream DNA repair mechanisms.</p><p id="P8">We next explored the functional implications of the captured A3B-editing sites using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. When compared to random genomic locations, the TC&gt;TT substitution in A+ and M+ colonies was significantly enriched in non-coding regulatory and transcription factor (TF) binding regions relative to protein-coding regions, an effect not seen in either VC&gt;VT or ND&gt;NN substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). To further dissect function of these regulatory regions, we constructed an 18-state ChromHMM model for the T-47D cells using ChIP-seq data from six histone marks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>) and computed its degree of overlap between the captured mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>) using previously described methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In the A+ colonies we found overrepresentation of TC&gt;TT mutations at transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancers, especially at the flanking regions of TSS and active enhancers. This pattern can also be found for intrinsic APOBEC-induced mutations in M+ colonies, but to a lesser extent than the A+ colonies. Analysis of DNA replication timing analysis using T-47D Repli-seq data from ENCODE indicated that the mapped TC&gt;TT substitutions and omikli events in A+ colonies occurred early in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). These findings are in accordance with previous observations that A3B targets genomic regions being actively transcribed and/or involved in early replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Overall, our data demonstrate a clear association between A3B-mediated base-editing and sites of gene transcription, consistent with a previously defined role for A3B in transcription regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A3B binds and deaminates ssDNA in R-loops</title><p id="P9">We evaluated whether R-loops, a co-transcriptionally formed DNA:RNA hybrid, could provide substrates for A3B activity. In A+ colonies, TC&gt;TT substitutions are flanked by a high level of GC-skewness for DNA sequences, which denotes overrepresentation of guanine bases in the same DNA strand as the TC&gt;TT editing event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This also translates to an enrichment of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in ±500 bp regions around A3B-editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). A similar effect can be seen around TC&gt;TT substitutions from M+ colonies, albeit to a much lesser extent, but not around TC&gt;TT or other di-nucleotide substitutions in the A-colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A-B</xref>). Both GC-skew and G-quadraplex forming sequences are features reported to facilitate the formation or stabilisation of R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We mapped R-loops in parent T-47D cells using strand-specific DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (ssDRIP-seq; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>) coupled with RNase H-dependency, GC-skewness and MNase-seq analyses to verify the identification of R-loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D-E</xref>). We found significant enrichment of R-loop signals in close proximity to TC&gt;TT substitutions in A+ colonies. Strand-specific sequencing demonstrated that the TT&gt;TC substitutions occurred on the ssDNA strand of the R-loop consistent with A3B preferentially editing the displaced ssDNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). A weaker R-loop signal can be found at TC&gt;TT substitutions from M+ colonies, but not in any other types of di-nucleotide substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To further examine the association between R-loops and A3B-mediated editing, we first carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the R-loop-binding S9.6 antibody, a previously reported methodology for isolating R-loops and their binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Similar to DDX5, a previously validated R-loop binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, A3B co-complexed with immuno-precipitated R-loops, which was abrogated by the overexpression of RNaseH1, an enzyme that digests RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, the genomic binding sites of flag-tagged A3B were mapped using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ssDNA-associated protein immunoprecipitation (SPI-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> the latter of which is an approach better suited to capturing protein-bound ssDNA. More than half of A3B peaks detected by either method are found in the vicinity (&lt; 1.5 kb) of R-loops. Although both methods yielded a similar proportion of R-loop-proximal A3B peaks (61% of all sequences with SPI-seq, 59% with standard ChIP-seq) the SPI-seq approach was more sensitive (p &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). We also found that the SPI-seq captured more A3B-bound ssDNA fragments located in the body of R-loops, in contrast to standard ChIP-seq which captures R-loop-flanking dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Induced expression of RNaseH1 is known to reduce genomic R-loop content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and we found that A3B peaks adjacent to R-loops were specifically reduced by expressing RNaseH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-G</xref>), demonstrating a negative effect of R-loop clearance on A3B binding to genomic DNA. In addition, we observed a higher level of SPI-seq signal at TC&gt;TT substitutions in A+ and M+ colonies compared with conventional ChIP-seq, and the binding of A3B to these sites was modulated by the expression of RNaseH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2G</xref>). This suggests R-loop formation facilitates A3B binding and cytidine deamination.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ER-induced R-loop formation facilitates A3B binding</title><p id="P11">Since activation of ER triggers the formation of co-transcriptional R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that elevated levels of genomic R-loops would boost the availability of A3B substrate and in turn facilitate A3B binding to ER-activating enhancer regions. To test this, flag-tagged A3B binding sites and R-loops that are responsive to E2 stimulation were mapped using SPI-seq and ssDRIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) in T-47D breast cancer cells, which allowed the study of their spatial-temporal relationship. Similar to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we observed an overall increase in A3B binding (23,711; 53% of all the peaks) and R-loop (18,567; 16% of all the peaks) peaks upon exposure to E2 for two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, following exposure to E2, a significant proportion of newly formed A3B binding sites are proximal to R-loops (p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, χ<sup>2</sup> test), and correspondingly, R-loops near A3B binding sites are more susceptible to E2 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Because of the significant overlap between E2-induced A3B binding sites and R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), we investigated a potential causal relationship between enhanced A3B binding and formation of R-loops. Depletion of A3B with siRNA does not affect the overall levels of R-loop signal or the increase in R-loops in response to E2-induction, as detected using slot blotting with S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-C</xref>). Quantitative ssDRIP-seq also shows an increase of R-loops in proximity to A3B binding sites despite knockdown of A3B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). Using DESeq2 quantification method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we investigated the interaction between A3B siRNA and E2 treatments and observed minimal combinatorial effect on R-loop up-regulation between the two treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). More than half of E2-induced A3B peaks were situated either near E2-induced R-loops (34%) or R-loops that exist prior to E2 treatment (28%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), while R-loop-proximal A3B peaks had higher degree of induction upon E2 treatment relative to R-loop-distal A3B peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>). These results indicate that elevated A3B binding is unlikely to be linked to induction of R-loops and instead that R-loop availability may determine E2-induced A3B binding and editing. To test this, we investigated whether overexpression of RNaseH1 affects A3B binding in five loci with well-defined ER binding and R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast to A3B binding sites without R-loops, clearance of R-loops upon overexpression of RNaseH1 impairs A3B binding induced by exposure to E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data confirm that the binding of A3B to specific regions induced by exposure to E2 involves a subset of R-loops serving as substrates.</p><p id="P13">Our findings suggest a model where R-loop formation reshapes the genomic landscape around EREs to facilitate recruitment of A3B. Using our ChromHMM model, we found that E2-induced A3B binding sites that overlap with R-loops have higher enrichment scores in TSS, TSS flanking regions, and transcribed enhancers relative to those E2-induced A3B binding sites that are distal to R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similarly, R-loops induced by E2 exposure are enriched in TSS and transcribed enhancers compared to the remaining pool of the non-induced R-loops, suggesting co-transcriptionally formed R-loops by E2 induction may facilitate A3B binding. Analysis of TF binding motifs reveals a different set of TFs potentially enriched in E2-regulated R-loop proximal peaks as opposed to R-loop-distal A3B peaks, where most sequence motifs in the former group are G-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that enhanced R-loop availability induced by transactivation at ER enhancers or promoters may regulate A3B binding and editing activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A3B promotes DSB formation at E2-induced R-loop</title><p id="P14">Previous studies have shown that DSB formation induced by ER transactivation can be arise from the processing of either co-transcriptionally formed R-loops or A3B editing sites by DNA damage repair mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate the link between these processes, we employed DSBCapture-seq to precisely map genomic DSB sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and to study the dependency of E2-induced DSBs on A3B and/or R-loops. We exposed T-47D breast cancer control and A3B-depleted cells to either DMSO or E2 for two hours, followed by DSBCapture-seq procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Differential peak analysis of the sequencing results by DiffBind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> revealed two groups of DSBs: DSBs that are induced by exposure to E2 (‘E2-induced DSBs’), and DSBs modified by A3B knockdown (‘A3B-modified DSBs’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our results echo the reported widespread DNA damage following by ER activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and show that the 15,259 E2-induced DSB peaks accounts for 30% of all the detectable DSBs in the genome of the T-47D cell-line. Notably, 5,308 of the DSB peaks were modified by A3B-depletion, of which a majority (88%, p &lt; 10<sup>5</sup> by Χ<sup>2</sup> test) overlapped with E2-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This enrichment of A3B-modified DSBs in the E2-induced DSB set is consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Closer inspection of DSB sites identified in our study found that almost all (98.6%) of the A3B-modified DSB sites we detected overlapped with the E2-induced A3B binding sites identified by quantitative SPI-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), supporting a role for A3B in these DSBs. However, A3B binding alone is not sufficient to predict A3B-dependent formation of DSBs since 74% of the E2-induced A3B-independent DSBs, defined by up-regulated DSBs despite the depletion of A3B, also overlapped with A3B binding sites defined by SPI-seq. Instead, we found a requirement for R-loop formation prior to subsequent A3B binding to generate A3B-modified DSBs, since we detected a significant overlap with R-loops for these DSBs compared with E2-induced DSBs that were A3B-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Accordingly, both R-loop formation and A3B binding distinguished A3B-modified DSBs from A3B-independent DSBs (96% vs 42%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) and were good indicators of the impact of A3B depletion on DSB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, our results support the involvement of R-loop formation in the generation of A3B-induced DSBs.</p><p id="P15">A closer inspection of the regions flanking DSBs revealed some distinct features associated with A3B-dependent DSBs. These included higher bidirectional transcription activities (as determined by GRO-seq), RNA polymerase II (PolII) occupancy, and denser G-quadruplex-forming sequences, all of which favour the formation of R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Using our ChromHMM model, A3B-dependent DSBs were found to be more enriched in active/flanking TSS and transcribed enhancers, a group of chromatin states also enriched in E2-induced R-loops, suggesting an influence of R-loops on the DSB landscape similar to that seen for A3B binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). These observations indicated a dependency on R-loops during the processing of A3B editing sites to DSBs. To test this, we analysed the five R-loop-overlapping A3B binding sites where A3B-dependent DSBs were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) and tested the effect of RNAi-mediated depletion of Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. CSB is a TC-NER component known to be required for converting R-loops into DNA strand breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> . Using quantitative PCR on DSBCapture-enriched DNA samples, we found that even modest CSB depletion was sufficient to reduce E2 responsive A3B-dependent DSB formation, but not E2-induced, A3B-independent DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). These results revealed a requirement of R-loop processing into single-strand breaks (SSB) for the formation of A3B-dependent DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Blocking uracil base-processing impairs E2 response</title><p id="P16">The genomic location of A3B-binding sites, especially those in proximity to R-loops and linked to the formation of DSBs, suggested a gene regulatory role for the down-stream processing of A3B base-editing. To address this, we performed RNA-seq studies on T-47D breast cancer cells harbouring a doxycycline inducible enzymatically inactive A3B** and hUGI cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This construct prevents the downstream processing of the intrinsic A3B-mediated C&gt;U editing sites by inhibiting UNG enzymes. We collected RNA samples after exposing cells to E2 for 16 hours, with or without doxycycline induction, and performed RNA-seq. For differential gene expression analysis, interaction modelling by DEseq2 programme was employed to dissect the impact of UNG inhibition (by hUGI) over E2 response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Results showed that the expression of A3B**-hUGI dampened the E2-regulated response of 87% of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), out of which 90 genes were identified as statistically significant with an interaction model by DESeq2. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Using pathway enrichment analysis with MSigDB hallmark gene set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, we observed a significant overlap between these genes and genes regulated by estrogen response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating a requirement for uracil repair during the transactivation of ER. In order to investigate whether the genes likely to be regulated by A3B are affected by lack of uracil-repair mechanisms, we first used the predictive algorithm rGREAT to generate two groups of genes which are most likely to associated with regions that could form gene-regulating DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, the first one contained 86 genes that were associated with A3B-dependent DSBs, and the latter one contained 333 genes that were associated with all E2-induced A3B binding sites that were proximal to R-loops. Using our RNA-seq data as the input for leading edge analysis by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, we found a significant overlap between genes from both of these groups and with genes up-regulated by E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting the formation of A3B-dependent DSBs may facilitate the transactivation of ER-regulated genes. More importantly, the genes from both groups were also enriched with E2-regulated genes that were negatively affected by A3B**-hUGI expression which confers BER-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the inability to process A3B-editing sites into DSBs in certain regulatory regions hampered the transactivation of gene expression following E2 stimulation. Together, our collective results demonstrate that the downstream processing of A3B C&gt;U editing sites, which leads to formation of DSBs, may promote E2 response in T-47D cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>TDRD3 guides A3B binding to regulatory elements</title><p id="P17">We found that ER activation leads to pervasive formation of R-loops with potential to be A3B substrates; however, only a subset of these R-loops was bound by A3B, suggesting a molecular mechanism that facilitates R-loop selectivity. To test whether this potential selectivity could be driven by proteins interacting with A3B, we employed BioID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, a proximity-dependent labelling method, to capture A3B binding partners. A3B tagged with BirA* on either N- or C-terminal was used as bait, and BirA*-red fluorescent protein (RFP) was used as control. In addition to T-47D cells, the BioID experiments were also carried out in two additional cell lines, MDA-MB-468 with high A3B expression background, and MCF-10-A with very low A3B levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). <italic>Bona-fide</italic> A3B interactors were selected against common BioID backgrounds using SAINTexpress score in conjunction with historical BioID non-specific controls curated in the CRAPome database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Our results showed a general overlap of A3B interactors across different cell lines, which also found a higher rate of detection in higher intrinsic A3B expressing cancer cells than the low-expression MCF-10-A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Using A3B interactors detected in at least two cell lines, we plotted an interaction network using common protein-protein interaction databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) and found two clusters of interactions: one with mainly RNA-binding or HNRNP components and the other comprising members of the TOP3B-TDRD3-FMRP (TTF) complex, a protein complex known in function in R-loop resolution within cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. To validate the interactions between the TTF complex and A3B, we carried out co-immunoprecipitations and found A3B was able to interact with TDRD3 and FMRP either with or without the bridging effect of nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Upon closer inspection, we found that A3B binds only isoform 1 of TDRD3, but not the shorter isoforms 2 and 3, which lack part of an N-terminal OB-fold, suggesting the OB-fold site may contribute to A3B binding. TOP3B was not detected in the A3B complex, despite evidence for binding to TDRD3 at the N-terminus domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). As TOP3B also scored as a hit in the A3B BioID, there may be a dynamic but potentially mutually exclusive binding interaction between A3B, TOP3B and TDRD3.</p><p id="P18">To further investigate the link between TDRD3 and the binding of A3B to DNA, we conducted TDRD3 ChIP-seq in T-47D cells as well as A3B SPI-seq in cells depleted of TDRD3 by RNAi. Knockdown of TDRD3 attenuated approximately 78% of A3B binding sites identified by SPI-seq when compared to control cells, suggesting that A3B binding requires TDRD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of ChIP-seq data showed that these putative TDRD3-dependent A3B sites also displayed a strong TDRD3 binding capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref>). We performed ChIP-seq experiments using an antibody (Millipore H3<sup>R17me2a</sup>) that recognises a spectrum of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)-modified proteins which are validated TDRD3 interactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, and found these proteins co-localised with A3B binding sites identified by SPI-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref>). These results suggest that ADMA-modified proteins bind A3B and regulate its binding to DNA. When compared to DRIP-seq and DSBCapture results, a majority (62%) of the putative TDRD3-dependent A3B binding sites are R-loop-proximal, and notably, these sites also tend to overlap A3B-dependent DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). From the perspective of TDRD3 binding sites, a large proportion (79%) of the <italic>bona fide</italic> binding sites identified using ChIP-seq overlapped with A3B binding sites, the signals of which were also attenuated by TDRD3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). Also, more than half of the A3B-overlapping TDRD3 binding sites were proximal to R-loops, showing a bias towards A3B-dependent DSBs, and had a similar ChromHMM profile to A3B-dependent DSBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B-C</xref>). Detailed quantitative studies on seven putative TDRD3-dependent A3B binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) using DRIP-qPCR and SPI-qPCR on T-47D cells confirmed a requirement of intrinsic TDRD3 on A3B binding, while depletion of TDRD3 has minimal impact on R-loop formation on these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I-J</xref>). Therefore, our results suggests that TDRD3 may play an important role to guide the binding of A3B to regulatory elements and may serve as a mechanism to regulate its function in converting R-loops into DSBs during regulation of transcription.</p><p id="P19">Taken together, our results support a mechanistic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) in which TDRD3 functions as an adapter protein directing the DNA deamination activity of A3B to ssDNA strand of R-loops upon transactivation of ER, which also induces ADMA post-translational modifications of protein complexes localising to enhancers or promoters. The induction of co-transcriptional R-loops and A3B editing upon ER activation leads to ER-induced DNA DSBs, which modulate the chromatin configuration of enhancer or promoter regions and contribute to chromosomal instability in ER-driven cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Thus far, numerous endeavours have been attempted to detect, sample and measure A3B-driven DNA deamination sites, advancing our understanding of A3B function in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, direct capturing and mapping of A3B sites in cancer cells has so far proven to be challenging, mainly because of the masking effect of the highly effective BER and a TP53-dependent synthetic lethal interaction between BER-deficiency and A3B enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Here, we circumvented this problem by using a BER-deficient, A3B-overexpressing human breast cancer cell line model in a <italic>TP53</italic> functional loss context. By sequencing a number of clones, our approach captured A3B-driven mutations in bulk, as supported by strand-coordinated focal TC&gt;TT hypermutations and NMF signatures with known A3B traits. The strong association between these sites with regulatory elements (TSS and enhancers), transcriptional activity and early DNA replication timing strengthens the role of A3B as a TF (in our case, ER) co-activator. We encourage additional studies beyond ER-driven models to examine whether A3B could also have a similar effect on other TFs, especially other nuclear receptors.</p><p id="P21">Using the A3B deamination sites detected by WGS, we also added R-loops into the known repository of A3B substrates in addition to lagging DNA synthesis strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, loop regions of DNA hairpins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, and ssDNA intermediates during recombination and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The predominant pathway processing A3B-catalysed uracil lesions in the context of R-loops is the BER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which has been observed in previous studies in APOBEC-Cas9-mediated R-loop editing and the AID-catalysed deamination within R-loops during immunoglobulin class switch recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, if R-loops are resolved before repair of the uracil lesion, the re-annealing of the template strand will lead to a U:G mismatch which can also be repaired by DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Unlike the BER that faithfully repairs the U:G lesion, MMR is known to cause omikli mutations and is detectable using datasets from TCGA project and ICGC consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, DNA sequences flanking putative A3B-driven omikli mutations detected in these real-world datasets did not display any R-loop traits, suggesting that A3B-catalysed uracil bases in R-loops were predominantly repaired by BER.</p><p id="P22">Importantly, we also demonstrated that the repair of A3B-catalysed uracil bases in R-loops is part of a mechanism leading to the formation of R-loop-mediated DSBs, which are known to affect chromosome integrity and contribute to genomic heterogeneity in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. It has been shown previously that R-loop clearance by TC-NER factors, such as XPF/XPG enzymes, removes stretches of DNA/RNA hybrid and results in SSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Further collision with the replication fork/transcriptional machinery, or actions by unidentified structure-specific endonucleases are required to generate DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Here, we have identified a unique way of R-loop-mediated DSB formation, which does not require the above-mentioned prerequisites but is achieved instead by the introduction of SSBs by BER-processing of A3B-deaminated bases at the opposite strand of R-loop-induced SSBs. This mechanism further details the role of A3B in inducing DSBs at ER binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and our observations unify the roles of R-loops and A3B during the formation of DSB following ER activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">A fuller understanding of how SSBs effect R-loop homeostasis will require further investigation. Recently, McCann et al. demonstrated that a high-level expression of A3B in cells results in an accelerated clearance rate of steady-state- or stimulation-induced-R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We speculate that this process would also be accompanied by an elevated level of DNA DSBs as many of the A3B-dependent DSBs display a requirement for R-loop formation in our study. More sophisticated studies will be needed to determine whether A3B-mediated SSBs occur prior to the clearance of DNA:RNA hybrid, and if so, whether R-loops with a SSB would serve as a better substrate for TC-NER.</p><p id="P24">Using BioID-based mass-spectroscopy proteomics, we identified TDRD3 as a binding partner leading to the recruitment of A3B to enhancer/TSS R-loops. TDRD3 is an oncogene and a transcriptional coactivator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, and can be recruited to active chromatin by the binding of its Tudor domain to ADMA-modified proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. TDRD3 exerts its function by acting as an adapter, linking these ADMA-modified proteins to effector proteins, such as TOP3B and DHX9 that resolve R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Despite both being R-loop processors, A3B may have distinct functions compared with TOP3B, that may lead to different transcriptional outcomes. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that A3B and TOP3B compete for the same binding site on TDRD3. Previous studies have shown that loss of either TOP3B or A3B could result in R-loop accumulation and elevated DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, it will be interesting to compare the DSB-inducing capabilities of these two enzymes in future studies and identify mechanisms leading to the selection of TDRD3 partners.</p><p id="P25">Our results also demonstrate that R-loop selection by A3B may be achieved by binding of TDRD3 to ADMA-modified proteins including histones (H3<sup>R17me2a</sup>/H4<sup>R3me2a</sup>), Pol II (Pol II<sup>R1810me2a</sup>) and the mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12<sup>R1899me2a</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.

Using hUGI as a surrogate of functional-loss of A3B and transcriptional profiling by RNA-seq, we showed that ER-mediated transactivation programmes rely on A3B-mediated DNA editing in these regions, consolidating A3B as a regulator of ER activity independent of ER-ligand associations.</p><p id="P26">Previous reports have proposed A3B as a therapeutic target in a model where elevated A3B drives tamoxifen-resistance through the acquisition of increased A3B-dependent gene mutations.
