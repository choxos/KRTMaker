Here, we assembled an extensive transcriptomic dataset covering twenty bilaterian species and eight tissues, selecting a specular phylogeny that allowed both the combined and parallel investigation of gene expression evolution between vertebrates and insects. We specifically focused on widely conserved ancestral genes, identifying strong cores of pan-bilaterian tissue-specific genes and even larger groups that diverged to define vertebrate and insect tissues. Systematic inferences of tissue-specificity gains and losses show that nearly half of all ancestral genes have been recruited into tissue-specific transcriptomes. This occurred during both ancient and, especially, recent bilaterian evolution, with several gains being associated with the emergence of unique phenotypes. Such pervasive evolution of tissue-specificity was linked to gene duplication coupled with specialization, including an unappreciated prolonged effect of whole genome duplications during recent vertebrate evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Fossil records reconstruct the image of the last common ancestor (LCA) of all bilaterian animals as a small, marine creature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> crawling on the seafloor approximately 700 million years ago (MYA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Despite its apparent simplicity, this ancestral organism introduced remarkable biological novelties, including an original body plan, defined by two perpendicular symmetry axes, and a third embryonic germ layer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, it already possessed an ancestral form of the main tissue types that are homologous across extant bilaterian species, including a nervous system, skeletal muscle, female and male gonads, through guts and an excretory system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. How did this ancient organism specify such a great variety of biological structures? Since all its cells shared the same genome, gene expression regulation was likely key for the generation of unique transcriptomes across these ancestral tissue types, and consequently for the emergence of their distinctive biological functions.</p><p id="P3">The bilaterian ancestor gave rise to the vast majority of extant animals, where the original body plan and tissues have been greatly diversified and modified. Determinants of animal evolution include changes in gene complements (i.e. protein-coding sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and regulatory changes in gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In fact, as the generation of tissue-specific transcriptomes is key for defining distinct tissue types (i.e., intra-species diversity), their evolutionary remodeling is arguably the most crucial determinant of phenotypic variation among species (i.e. inter-species diversity) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Importantly, major transcriptome remodeling often involves conserved genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Examples of such occurrences underlie important phenotypic novelties in key bilaterian lineages: the vertebrate endocrine pancreas emerged following the recruitment of ancestrally neural-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and it has been suggested that insect wings evolved upon co-option of expression of ancient genes originally involved in gill specification and proximal leg segments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Still, even if remarkable cases linked to biological novelties have been identified, the specific role that the evolution of expression of ancestral genes played in shaping homologous, yet often highly divergent, tissues between distant bilaterian lineages has never been thoroughly assessed.</p><p id="P4">Comparative transcriptomic data offer valuable insights into ancestral molecular states (e.g., ancestral expression profiles) and their subsequent history. Here, we studied the evolution of tissue-specific transcriptomes based on an extensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset covering eight tissue types from twenty bilaterian species, including novel data for fifteen of them. Compared to previous studies of transcriptome evolution, mostly focused on mammals, this dataset extends the phylogenetic coverage beyond vertebrates and provides the first comparative framework of this scale for insects. Vertebrates and insects were selected as focus clades because they include highly accessible organisms with a relatively similar body plan compared to other lineages (e.g., most lophotrochozoans). However, they also reached some opposite evolutionary solutions in terms of structural organization (e.g., dorsal/ventral positioning of the spinal/nerve cords in vertebrates and insects, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>), and show remarkably different molecular and genomic evolutionary rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We selected a symmetric phylogeny for both species groups, which allowed us to perform sound ancestral inferences as well as to uncover parallel, convergent and divergent evolutionary trajectories in comparable evolutionary/phylogenetic nodes of these early diverging bilaterian lineages. First, we characterized global gene expression patterns and reconstructed ancestral bilaterian tissue-specific modules that are still widely conserved across extant species. Second, we systematically inferred gains and losses of tissue-specific expression throughout our selected bilaterian phylogeny. Lastly, we characterized these inferred tissue-specificity gains from the mechanistic and functional perspective. Overall, our work sheds light on the highly plastic nature of deeply conserved genes in terms of tissue-specific expression patterns, which we find to be tightly linked to gene duplication, specialization and the emergence of unique tissue-related phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of global patterns of gene expression across bilaterian tissues</title><p id="P5">In order to reliably investigate the evolution of tissue-specific transcriptomes in two key bilaterian lineages, we selected twenty representative species (eight gnathostome vertebrates, eight insects and two pairs of relative outgroups) evenly divided into two monophyletic branches with specular phylogenetic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). After correcting for broken/chimeric genes and enriching the annotations of the majority of the species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we derived gene orthology relationships among all of them and isolated 7,178 bilaterian-conserved gene orthogroups, which were unambiguously present in the bilaterian LCA (i.e., conserved in at least 12/20 species. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In addition, as several comparisons required the selection of one representative ortholog per species, we generated the most suitable one-to-one orthogroups for each set of analyses (i.e., best-ancestral and best-TS orthogroups; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) by applying distinct filters to the original bilaterian-conserved orthogroups. We then assembled an extensive bulk RNA-seq dataset covering up to eight tissues in all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Notably, while some of the included tissue types (neural, testis, ovaries, muscle and excretory system) had been considered in previous studies of gene expression evolution among bony vertebrate species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, others (digestive tract, epidermis and adipose) have never been analyzed in such a context. In total, we generated 89 RNA-seq samples across 15 species, which we combined with publicly available data into a final dataset of 346 RNA-seq meta-samples (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for meta-samples definition), including up to three meta-samples for each tissue and species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In our dataset, the first two components of a principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear distinction between meta-samples from vertebrates and non-vertebrates (including all outgroups), independently from their tissue identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for normalization procedure). The same pattern is observed when controlling for potential batch effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-f</xref>) or using alternative strategies for the selection and expression quantification of the best-ancestral orthogroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g-j</xref>). Thus, this separation probably emerged because of some intrinsic differences between vertebrates and insects, which we further investigated by performing clade-specific PCAs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The first two components of the vertebrate PCA outlined groups of meta-samples of the same tissue origin (specially for neural and testis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>), confirming the pattern characterized by previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and validating the idea of a conserved, tissue-related transcriptomic signature that prevails over the species identity. On the other hand, the first two components of the insect PCA were dominated by species clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>), with successive components separating species according to their evolutionary distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). Altogether, these results thus suggest faster evolutionary rates within and between insects compared to vertebrates, as reflected by the vertebrate/non-vertebrate meta-samples separation in the first two components of the bilaterian PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Nevertheless, some subsequent components of this PCA significantly separated groups of meta-samples based on their tissue of origin, starting with neural and testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>). Thus, we performed a z-score transformation of gene expression values within species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) in order to compare their relative expression profiles across tissues. Upon this transformation, we obtained clusters largely corresponding to tissue groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>), which suggested at least partial conservation of ancestral bilaterian tissue-specific expression modules.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reconstruction of ancestral bilaterian tissue-specific expression modules</title><p id="P7">In order to characterize ancestral tissue-specific expression modules that are still widely conserved across extant bilaterians, we implemented a strategy based on a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which allowed us to isolate the orthogroups with the most distinctive expression profiles in each tissue (compared to the others) across all species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a-f</xref>). The sPLS-DA approach was set up to produce eight sets (one per tissue type) of ancestral orthogroups with conserved tissue-specific expression, which overall comprised 506 (~7%) of all bilaterian-conserved orthogroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). A PCA performed on these ancestral orthogroups (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), or subsets of these orthogroups of the same size across tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), showed aggregation by tissue type, with a clear separation between all neural and non-neural meta-samples along the first principal component.</p><p id="P8">We next investigated in detail the orthogroups belonging to the neural and testis modules, whose expression profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4g-l</xref> for other modules). The neural module presented strong over-representation of gene ontology (GO) categories related to synaptic transmission, neuronal morphology and other associated terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), reflecting the high expression conservation of the specialized neuronal gene complement across eumetazoan nervous systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The testis module showed significant enrichments for cilium and cytoskeleton-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), probably determined by the axoneme, a highly conserved microtubule-based structure located at the core of most bilaterian spermatozoa flagella and indispensable for their mobility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The relevant role that these ancestral orthogroups likely play in the respective tissue is supported by their significantly greater association with validated neural- or testis-related phenotypes either in mammals or fly, compared to all bilaterian-conserved orthogroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>; p-value &lt; 1e-05 for both tissues, Fisher's exact tests).</p><p id="P9">In addition to the neural and testis modules, all other sets exhibited GO enrichments coherent with the deep-rooted functions of each tissue, and comparable between the human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>) and fruit fly based GO annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary table 7</xref>). For instance, genes in the ancestral ovary module comprised several key meiotic genes and were enriched in cell cycle and DNA-replication/repair functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 4,6,7</xref>). Some examples included <italic>CCNB2</italic>, a cyclin necessary for timely oocyte maturation and correct metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, <italic>MOS</italic>, a serine-threonine kinase which mediates metaphase II arrest during meiosis and whose deletion causes human female infertility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and <italic>CPEB</italic>, a protein involved in regulation of translation prior to fertilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. As another example, the most significant GO categories for the excretory system module, mainly ion transport and amino acid metabolism, reflected the basic shared functions of ultrafiltration-based excretory systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, even in those tissues in which the homology status of the specific cellular components is more ambiguous/complex (e.g., epidermis, digestive system, adipose), we still obtained a few significant enrichments linked to core molecular programs underlying fundamental functions of each tissue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Finally, we investigated which transcription factors (TFs) might have regulated these ancestral modules since the bilaterian LCA. We specifically tested if the TFs included in each module presented a significant over-representation of predicted binding sites in the regulatory regions of all the other genes in the same ancestral set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). We obtained significant results for multiple TFs, comprising several known master regulators of the respective tissues such as PAX4/6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> or FEZF1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> in neural, MEF2A-D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> in muscle and GRHL1/2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> in epidermis. Importantly, over-representation of their binding sites was observed both at the module level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>) and within each studied species separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In summary, we reconstructed eight confident modules of ancestral orthogroups with highly conserved tissue-specific expression profiles, offering a high-resolution snapshot of the tissue-specific transcriptomes in the bilaterian LCA.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pervasive evolution of tissue-specificity of ancestral genes impacts both ancient and recent bilaterian history</title><p id="P12">In order to study the evolution of tissue-specificity throughout our entire phylogeny, we next used the Tau metric to define genes with tissue-specific expression profiles in all extant species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The overall proportion of tissue-specific genes (Tau ≥ 0.75) in each species was lower for bilaterian-conserved genes (i.e., belonging to the 7,178 bilaterian-conserved orthogroups) compared to all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). This was partially expected, as highly conserved genes are usually associated with greater pleiotropic roles. We assigned each bilaterian-conserved, tissue-specific gene to the tissue(s) with the highest relative expression (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), providing a comprehensive characterization of their tissue-specificity across all species and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Neural- and testis-specific genes were the most abundant throughout our phylogeny, followed by genes with restricted expression in two different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Overall, the number of tissue-specific genes was significantly higher among vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>; p-value = 2e-04; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), likely as a consequence of the two whole genome duplications (WGDs) at the base of vertebrates (see below).</p><p id="P13">We then set out to investigate the conservation of the identified tissue-specific profiles. Remarkably, we found that these profiles were overall poorly conserved. For instance, for the orthogroups that have at least one gene that is tissue-specific in mouse, only a median of 6 out of the other 19 species had at least one ortholog with Tau ≥ 0.75 (with any associated tissue), and this number merely increased to 9 for Tau ≥ 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). This pattern was consistent across all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that tissue-specificity is highly dynamic and that a high proportion of these tissue-specific expression profiles may have a recent evolutionary origin. In fact, when considering individual species alone, only between 4% and 15% of bilaterian-conserved orthogroups are tissue-specific in each of them (barplot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>); however, when all species are taken together, 47% of the bilaterian-conserved orthogroups contain at least one tissue-specific gene (line plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). In other words, the orthogroups containing tissue-specific genes are widely non-overlapping among species. As expected, orthogroups that are tissue-specific in at least one studied species presented a significantly higher proportion of gene duplications compared to orthogroups that are never tissue-specific (p-value = 2e-04, Fisher’s exact test), which in turn were strongly enriched for housekeeping functions such as RNA processing/binding and translation (extra boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Systematic inferences of gains and losses of tissue-specific expression throughout the phylogeny</title><p id="P14">Next, to investigate dynamics of tissue-specificity evolution in finer detail throughout the entire phylogeny, we adopted a parsimony-based approach to perform a systematic phylogenetic inference of tissue-specificity gains and losses in each tissue (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>; for the rationale behind our chosen procedure, the comparison with other inference methods and their limitations for our dataset, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). By definition, given the lack of non-bilaterian outgroups in our phylogeny, we could only infer tissue-specificity gains and losses posterior to the last bilaterian ancestor. Thus, we focused only on the patterns of gain/loss on the phylogenetically equivalent nodes along the two main branches and the tips leading to the extant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These inferences, as well as the underlying Tau values, were highly robust to the use of alternative combinations of the original RNA-seq samples (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), computed either after averaging the expression of all available samples for each tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) or after randomizing the samples of each tissue across the relative meta-samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, since we observed that gene expression divergence is subjected to stabilizing selection in all tissues along both phylogenetic branches, and thus mainly evolves following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), we used an OU-based approach to orthogonally validate our inferred tissue-specificity gains and losses, finding a good overall agreement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P15">According to our inference methodology, the Vertebrata ancestor presents the highest overall number of inferred tissue-specificity gains among all ancestral nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), even if some of the most important gain waves were observed for individual species (e.g., in fruit fly testis and frog ovary, with 198 and 109 gains, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). In this regard, we found that some genomic features were positively correlated with the number of species-specific, tissue-specific gains, but none of them reached statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a-e</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Comparison of the proportions of tissue-specificity gains and losses within each node and species shows that testis had the highest turnover, as it presented the greatest proportion of gains and/or losses in 30/39 (77%) of nodes/species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). On the contrary, neural gains are mainly prevalent in the most ancestral nodes on both branches (i.e., Euteleostomi/Neoptera or older), but while they seem to have little impact in later vertebrate evolution, they still dominate the gain landscape in several more recent insect nodes (e.g., Holometabola, Oligoneoptera and Diptera). Finally, as opposed to the most ancestral nodes, the tissue-specific transcriptome of few recent nodes and of the majority of single species is predominantly shaped by losses of tissue-specificity rather than by gains (i.e., we observed an average of 11% of losses on the total number of inferences for Tetrapoda/Holometabola and more ancient nodes, compared to 42% for more recent nodes and single species). While this result is expected, as by definition we infer losses of tissue-specificity only after a tissue-specificity gain has been identified in more ancestral nodes, it is still relevant to highlight the large plasticity of the expression profiles of ancestral genes during recent vertebrate and insect evolution.</p><p id="P17">We then evaluated enrichments of orthogroups with tissue-specificity gains across gene families, obtaining similar results upon definition of gene families based either on the human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>) or fruit fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>) annotation (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). On one hand, we found significant over-representation of tissue-specificity gains for many families of membrane proteins, including several types of transporters and receptors (e.g., ion channels, EGF transporters, G protein-coupled receptors, etc) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12a,b</xref>). On the other hand, families of house-keeping genes (e.g., rRNA, histone proteins) or enzymes devoted to basic cellular metabolic processes (e.g., tRNA synthetases, acetyl-transferases) were significantly depleted for tissue-specificity gains, in line with the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Evolution of tissue-specificity is tightly linked to gene duplication and specialization</title><p id="P18">We then compared the total numbers of tissue-specificity gains between phylogenetically equivalent nodes on the two branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The gain signal reached the overall maximum in the Vertebrata ancestor, consistent with a strong impact of the two rounds of WGD at the origin of this group. Strikingly, although this effect progressively decreased, the fraction of gains remained high throughout all subsequent vertebrate nodes, in clear contrast with the relative flat signal observed on the insect side (with the exception of the Neoptera ancestor, in line with a burst of gene duplication events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>). Moreover, gains in both the Vertebrata and subsequent nodes, as well as in the species-specific branches, showed a much higher proportion of orthogroups involving paralogs derived from the vertebrate WGDs (2R-ohnologs) compared to phylogenetically equivalent Insecta nodes and species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Altogether, this suggests the existence of a previously unappreciated prolonged evolutionary impact of vertebrate WGDs on the rewiring of tissue-specific transcriptomes.</p><p id="P19">Remarkably, the association between the gain of tissue-specificity and gene duplication extended beyond the vertebrate WGDs. For all nodes and extant species, we found that orthogroups with inferred tissue-specificity had a higher proportion of duplicates compared to the corresponding background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). Importantly, while the chances of having a tissue-specific gene are expected to increase with the number of paralogs in an orthogroup, randomizations showed that this effect cannot explain the observed association between gene duplication and tissue-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Moreover, we found evidence that the acquisition of tissue-specific expression occurred to a large extent through the process of specialization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, where the specialized paralog reduces its expression in most tissues, while (i) the other paralog(s) and (ii) their orthologs in other species conserve the ancestral, broader expression pattern (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). For example, under this model, the Eutheria testis-specific genes are expected to have lower expression across the other tissues (i.e., all tissues but testis) compared to (i) their non testis-specific paralogs in eutherians and (ii) their orthologs in non-eutherians, as readily observed in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Both these patterns were consistently observed across all nodes and species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset</xref>), which prompted us to systematically evaluate the incidence of specialization events. We used as a metric the number of “specialization-supporting” tissues, corresponding to all those tissues (excluding the tissue with tissue-specificity) where the expression of a given ortholog is lower in the set of species with tissue-specificity compared to those without. We plotted the total number of specialization-supporting tissues (from 0 to 7) for tissue-specificity gains across different groups of nodes and species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), showing that, in all cases, specialization events (i.e., number of specialization-supporting tissues ≥ 5) occurred more extensively than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Tissue-specificity gains are associated with emergence of unique tissue-related phenotypes</title><p id="P21">Exploiting the symmetric structure of our phylogeny, we also identified 156 bilaterian-conserved orthogroups that acquired unique but distinct tissue-specificity on the vertebrate and insect sides, thus fulfilling their functional potential in divergent contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). The most frequent pairs of tissues among which these parallel tissue-specificity gains occurred were neural and testis together with testis and ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>), in agreement with the compartments among which expression shifts are more likely to occur also within vertebrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition to these divergent/parallel tissue-specificity gains, we also characterized independent convergent acquisitions of the same tissue-specific expression profiles in both the vertebrate and the insect sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Such convergent gains were most abundant in testis, probably as a consequence of the faster turnover of tissue-specificity this tissue experienced both in vertebrates and in insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). One exemplary case is represented by <italic>TESMIN</italic> and <italic>tomb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).

We found that a few gene functions were significantly and repeatedly enriched in multiple nodes/species on both phylogenetic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). GO categories such as double-strand DNA binding, cation transmembrane transport and animal organ morphogenesis were over-represented throughout all tissue types, but we also identified a few functions specifically enriched across somatic organ tissues (e.g., plasma membrane region, consistent with the gene family analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) or reproductive ones (mainly related to meiotic division). Moreover, GO enrichments performed with insect-specific GO annotations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) showed repeated enrichments for orthogroups involved in flight and cuticle formation, respectively, in muscle-specific and epidermis-specific gains throughout insect evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 11,12</xref>). In contrast, each tissue presented categories exclusively enriched across gains in a single node/species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 13</xref>), several of which could be linked to the concurrent emergence of novel phenotypic traits. For instance, only vertebrate neural-specific gains were significantly enriched in categories related to oligodendrocyte differentiation and ensheathment of neurons (i.e., the myelination of neuronal axons operated by the oligodendrocytes), consistent with the origin of these glial cells in the gnathostome vertebrate ancestor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In another example, we detected a distinctive enrichment in sensory perception of light stimulus in the octopus’ skin, likely reflecting the unique presence of light-activated chromatophores organs all over the cephalopod’s body surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Finally, we focused on the functions of species-specific, tissue-specific gains, which represent 59% of all our inferred gains. In order to identify functional categories potentially over-represented among these species-specific inferences, we plotted a distribution of GOs based on the proportion of their bilaterian-conserved orthogroups experiencing at least one of such species-specific gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Strikingly, the top 5% of this distribution includes cell-cell signaling, tissue development and several other morphogenesis-related or developmental categories, which are significantly over-represented in the upper tail compared to the lower percentiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9c,d</xref>). One remarkable example of a developmental gene included in these species-specific gains is <italic>FGF17</italic>, which is neural-specific only in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). <italic>FGF17</italic> is a fibroblast growth factor broadly expressed during the embryonic and postnatal brain development of multiple species, but which was co-opted in the adult brain only in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>; data from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>). Remarkably, a recent study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> showed that the <italic>Fgf17</italic> contained in the cerebrospinal fluid of young mice activates a transcriptional program leading to proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and, when injected into aged mice, slows down brain aging and improves memory functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Thus, even if Fgf17’s potential to induce oligodendrocyte proliferation seems to be ancestral, this gene became part of the adult neural-specific transcriptome only during recent human evolution, where it might contribute to the preservation of cognitive abilities in old age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">In this study, we have assembled an extensive dataset of RNA-seq samples spanning twenty bilaterian species and eight tissues, with the goal of tracing the evolution of gene expression in homologous tissues within and between vertebrates and insects. Therefore, in terms of phylogenetic range, our study represents a step forward compared to previous works where a similar framework of tissue transcriptional evolution has been applied <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, as it extends the investigation range to a large panel of vertebrate and non-vertebrate species, including organisms which diverged ~700 MYA. Indeed, our principal component analysis highlighted consistent transcriptome variation between vertebrate and non-vertebrate species, as perhaps expected given their distinct genomic features (e.g., larger genomes and gene numbers, as a consequence of the two WGDs events) and evolutionary traits (e.g., longer generation times). This variation manifests into characteristic transcriptomic signatures across tissue types, which are more homogenous in vertebrates and relatively more fast-evolving in the other species. Moreover, we designed our study around a symmetric phylogeny for the vertebrate and insect branches. This allowed us to identify not only ancestral features, but also parallel, convergent and divergent evolutionary trajectories of ancestral genes between and within these two major bilaterian lineages. Using this phylogenetic framework, we performed an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of tissue-specific expression among ancestral bilaterian genes. Strikingly, we found that nearly half of the ancestral bilaterian gene complement has acquired tissue-specific expression in at least one of the studied species, revealing a surprising plasticity for this transcriptomic trait. We thus investigated the timings and mechanisms behind the pervasive evolution of these tissue-specificity patterns, as well as their functional impact.</p><p id="P25">Before discussing these aspects, however, we acknowledge that a major limitation of our study is the use of bulk RNA-seq data, which merges the signals originating from the different cell types present in each tissue. This is a relevant issue, given that we are analyzing distantly related species with divergent tissue histologies. Thus, differences in cell type composition might be a confounding factor in our analyses of gene expression dynamics, especially those involving quantitative comparisons among species across the entire tissue panel (e.g., correlations, PCAs, etc.). Notwithstanding, we aimed at minimizing these considerations by explicitly studying tissue-specific patterns of expression, which are largely qualitative in nature (i.e., presence/absence), and thus are more robust to quantitative variations in cell type composition. Indeed, detected changes in tissue-specific transcriptomes can provide information about evolutionary events such as the origin of novel cell types. For instance, we detected enrichment for oligodendrocyte differentiation exclusively in the neural-specific genes acquired in the vertebrate node, concomitantly with the emergence of this cell type <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">With regards to evolutionary timings, our phylogenetic inference revealed that most ancestral genes acquired tissue-specific expression during late bilaterian evolution. Despite this, we found that at least ~7% of all ancestral orthogroups have been expressed in a tissue-specific manner since the bilaterian LCA, a number that might be higher if we had investigated more slow-evolving species, such as annelids or other lophotrochozoans. Importantly, all the ancestral tissue-specific modules we identified are linked to core functions within each tissue type, even in those tissues more divergent at the histological and cell type level (e.g., digestive system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>) or mainly originated by convergent morphological trajectories (e.g., fat-rich tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>). Moreover, we found that validated phenotypic effects both in mammals and in fly supported their extant, wide physiological relevance. Neural, muscle and reproductive organ transcriptomes present the largest ancestral tissue-specific modules; this suggests they have more distinctive and conserved transcriptomic signatures compared to other bilaterian tissues, likely related to the high complexity and specialization of the main cell types that form them (neurons, myocytes and meiotic cells, respectively).</p><p id="P27">At the mechanistic level, we showed that tissue-specific gains have a strong association with gene duplication across the entire bilaterian phylogeny, as previously reported for more restricted lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and demonstrated that this association is not simply due to multi-copy orthogroups having more chances of including tissue-specific members. Furthermore, we investigated how often evolution of tissue-specificity occurred through specialization, by which the specialized paralog in a given species reduced its expression in the tissues without tissue-specificity compared to the broadly expressed ancestral patterns, which are preserved in the non-tissue-specific paralogs of that species as well as the orthologs in the other species. This pattern had previously been identified for more restricted groups, including paralogs originated from vertebrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and salmon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> WGDs, together with gene duplicates specific in the pea aphid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, primates and rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>; here, we expanded the search space and provided evidence that specialization is associated with tissue-specificity gains throughout the entire bilaterian phylogeny. Another remarkable finding in the context of gene duplication is the seemingly prolonged effect of the vertebrate WGDs on the amount of tissue-specificity gains throughout recent vertebrate evolution. Specifically, the Vertebrata node showed the highest level of tissue-specificity gains in the phylogeny, particularly among paralogs retained from the WGDs (ohnologs), as expected from a direct causal effect of these events. However, subsequent ancestral nodes and extant species within the vertebrate lineage also exhibited higher number of gains, as well as a higher fraction of affected ohnologs, compared to other phylogenetically equivalent non-vertebrate nodes and species. While this could be partly due to loss of tissue-specificity in early branching vertebrate species, we suggest that this pattern reflects the increased likelihood of orthogroups with retained ohnologs in vertebrates to evolve tissue-specificity even millions of years after the WGDs that generated the genetic redundancy. If so, this unexpected finding implies that the evolutionary impact of WGDs on phenotypic diversification may go beyond immediate subsequent effects, providing an additional potential explanation for the lag observed between the timing of WGDs and their purported consequences in multiple lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Finally, we assessed the functional impact of the rewiring of tissue-specific transcriptomes. Almost 60% of our inferred tissue-specificity gains occurred in specific species and were often associated with the emergence of unique phenotypes, highlighting the potential of novel tissue-specific expression patterns to underlie organismal novelties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. For instance, we detected a distinctive enrichment in sensory perception of light stimulus in the octopus’ skin, consistent with the unique presence of light-activated chromatophores organs all over the cephalopod’s body surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We also uncovered a significant tendency for developmental genes to retain adult tissue-specific expression in a species-specific manner. Cases like <italic>FGF17</italic> in humans that we reported here point to a potential widespread, functional co-option of ancestral developmental genes within distinct tissue-specific transcriptomes throughout the most recent bilaterian evolution. Future research should elucidate the functional significance of the adult tissue-specific expression of these developmental genes as well as of the myriad of other tissue-specific genes we identified, and how they ultimately contribute to animal evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Genome annotation and sequence files</title><p id="P29">For eight species, we downloaded the GTF and genome FASTA files from Ensembl [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ensembl.org/">https://www.ensembl.org/</ext-link>], selecting the following assemblies and versions: human (<italic>Homo sapiens, Hsa</italic>: hg38, v88), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus, Mmu</italic>: mm10, v88), cow (<italic>Bos taurus, Bta</italic>: bosTau9, v99), opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica, Mdo</italic>: monDom5, v86), chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus, Gga</italic>: galGal6, v99), tropical clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis, Xtr</italic>: XenTro9, v101), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio, Dre</italic>: danRer10, v80), elephant shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii, Cmi</italic>: 6.1.3, v99).

All these samples were dissected from adult animals and the RNA extracted using the most suited protocol for the organism and tissue, namely TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher) or Qiagen RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) (see GEO series GSE205498 for more details on sample extraction and processing protocols). These RNA samples were used to construct standard Illumina RNA-seq libraries at the CRG Genomics Unit, and an average of ~78 million 125-nucleotide paired-end reads were generated for each of them in a HiSeq2500. In the case of octopus, the sequencing was performed at the University of Chicago, with NovaSeq. In total, we generated ~7.6 billion individual reads.

This expression similarity was defined as the average of all pairwise Pearson’s expression correlations across tissues between the target gene and each gene from all other species in the orthogroup (i.e., considering all genes where there are multiple copies), where expression in each tissue was defined as described above.

However, the relaxed approach inferred multiple gains on each branch if the minimum distance between two species or nodes respecting those tissue-specificity cutoffs was higher than 3 nodes (e.g. in human and in chicken, or in Eutheria and in zebrafish). Also, if no inference of gain in an ancestral node could be done by either approach, tissue-specific genes (as defined in the previous section) were considered species-specific gains. Finally, from the combined output of both approaches, we inferred an ancestral bilaterian (or earlier) tissue-specificity whenever a "gain" was identified in both Deuterostoma/Chordata/Vertebrata and Protostoma/Arthropoda/Insecta with either strict or relaxed criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>; “merged” label in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).

The double-optima OU model specifically assumed differences between the species with and without tissue-specificity, which have to be specified a priori, and where the latter group also included all species with inferred losses. To determine which model better fit the data, we compared the Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>; in case of equal AIC weights between the two models, we declared that no optimal model was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>, left panels). Then, for those cases where the double-OU model was the best fit, we checked if expression in the query tissue was higher for the species with tissue-specificity compared to the species without, expecting positive deltas for all cases representing supported tissue-specificity gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>, right panels). Finally, we generated two control groups for each of the test tissue sets, selecting a matching number of best-ancestral orthogroups (either starting from all orthogroups or only from those orthogroups without tissue-specific gains) to which we randomly assigned the tissue-specificity gain labels from the relative test set.

We performed a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) on the expression of the best-ancestral orthogroups, where each component specifically separated the meta-samples of one tissue group from all the others. We selected loadings of each component, which corresponded to orthogroups with the most distinctive expression profile in the isolated tissue compared to the rest. Finally, we required these orthogroups to show the highest median expression (after z-scoring expression within each species) in that particular tissue among both vertebrates and insects. <bold>b.</bold> Number of best-ancestral orthogroups (OGs) included in each ancestral tissue-specific module. <bold>c,d.</bold> Expression profiles across tissues of best-ancestral orthogroups in the ancestral neural- (c) and testis- (d) specific modules.
