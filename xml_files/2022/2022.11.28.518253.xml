A candidate mechanism is the disinhibition of pyramidal cells through vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SOM) positive interneurons. However, the interaction of attentional modulation and VIP-SOM disinhibition has never been directly tested. We used all-optical methods to bi-directionally manipulate VIP interneuron activity as mice performed an attention switching task. We measured the activity of VIP, SOM and parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons identified in the same tissue and found that although activity in all cell classes was modulated by both attention and VIP manipulation, their effects were orthogonal. Attention and VIP-SOM disinhibition relied on distinct patterns of changes in activity and reorganisation of interactions between inhibitory and excitatory cells. Circuit modelling revealed a precise network architecture consistent with multiplexing strong yet non-interacting modulations in the same neural population.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Attention exerts a powerful influence on how cortical circuits process sensory information. There are multiple forms of visual attention including spatial, feature based, and cross modality, and in all these cases attention can modulate visual processing leading to improved behavioural performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Typically, stimulus selectivity in visual cortex increases with attention, and this increased selectivity is believed to underlie the improved behavioural discriminability of attended stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The increase in stimulus selectivity of neurons occurs prominently through changes in stimulus-evoked firing rates. These changes can be increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> or decreases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> in evoked firing rates or combinations of these<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, which ultimately result in more selective stimulus representations. Changes in noise correlations, variability and synchrony between neurons may also play a role in improving the discriminability of stimuli by downstream circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, despite this thorough phenomenological description of the ways in which attention influences visual processing, very little is known about the circuit basis of attentional modulation in visual cortex.</p><p id="P3">Local inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping cortical activity. Cortical activity is processed by interconnected networks of cells containing multiple classes of excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons with distinct molecular, cellular and connectivity properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. VIP interneurons are key regulators of cortical function, most prominently due to their strong inhibition of SOM interneurons which results in disinhibition of excitatory pyramidal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. VIP-SOM driven disinhibition provides useful computational opportunities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. On a longer timescale, VIP-SOM disinhibition gates the plasticity of inputs onto excitatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Better studied, however, is the immediate effect of increasing activity in VIP interneurons, which leads to enhanced firing of local pyramidal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. This effect has been observed across many regions of sensory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, motor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Disinhibitory modulation of sensory cortex through VIP and SOM interneurons has in fact been proposed to be the core mechanism underlying attentional modulation in visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In this account, projections from frontal cortex activate VIP interneurons in V1 which leads to enhanced stimulus-evoked activation of pyramidal (PYR) cells though VIP-SOM disinhibition, and may lead to subsequent improvement in visual behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Attentional modulation in V1 and visual discrimination behaviour may also depend on cholinergic inputs to visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and cortical VIP interneurons are activated by acetylcholine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, raising the possibility of VIP interneurons being a key player in cholinergic visual gain enhancement during attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. This account has parallels with the suggestion that locomotion elevates the gain of visual responses in V1 through VIP-SOM disinhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, the direct interaction of attentional modulation and VIP modulation has never been tested.</p><p id="P5">If attention acts through VIP-SOM disinhibition, then two broad predictions exist. First, attention should have similar effects on pyramidal neurons as manipulating VIP interneurons. As a consequence, the degree to which attention modulates stimulus selectivity should depend on whether the VIP-SOM disinhibitory circuit is activated or not. In other words, there should be an interaction between attentional modulation and VIP-SOM disinhibition. Second, there should be similarities in how attention and VIP-SOM disinhibition modify the activity of different cell classes and the interactions between them.</p><p id="P6">To test these predictions, we used an all-optical approach in V1, where we simultaneously imaged the activity of PYR, PV, SOM and VIP interneurons, while optogenetically manipulating VIP interneurons to mimic physiologically relevant levels of activity, as mice performed a cross-modal attention-switching task. As mice switched between attending to or ignoring the same pair of visual stimuli, we observed robust attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity in V1. We also observed strong enhancement of V1 activity when photoactivating VIP interneurons, confirmed to be through VIP-SOM disinhibition, and a reduction in V1 activity when photoinhibiting VIP interneurons. However, when we combined VIP manipulations with attentional changes, we found that the two modulations did not interact, and instead were orthogonal. The changes induced by these two modulations occurred through distinct mechanisms: while VIP photoactivation led to predominantly enhanced activity in VIP, PV and PYR neurons, and largely suppressed activity in SOM neurons, attention led to heterogeneous changes, marked by a prominent reduction in evoked activity in all four cell classes. Circuit modelling revealed that only a specific network architecture can account for the experimental findings. These results demonstrate that VIP-SOM disinhibition does not underlie attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity in V1. At the same time, they reveal a remarkably versatile cortical circuit, which allows multiplexing of multiple non-interacting signals on the same neural populations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Modulation of stimulus selectivity by attention in V1</title><p id="P7">To study the neural circuit basis of attentional modulation, we trained mice to perform a cross-modality attention switching task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Head-fixed mice switched between blocks of visual discrimination and olfactory discrimination in which they licked a reward spout to obtain a reward in response to one of two visual grating stimuli or odours. During the olfactory discrimination blocks, the same grating stimuli used in the visual discrimination blocks were presented on 70% of trials but were irrelevant to the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Mice attended to and accurately discriminated the grating stimuli in the visual block but ignored the same grating stimuli while successfully discriminating odours during the olfactory blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, behavioural d’ of visual discrimination: visual block, attend visual, 3.47 ± 0.77; olfactory block, ignore visual, 0.55 ± 0.87, Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 7.56×10<sup>-10</sup>; behavioural d’ of olfactory discrimination, 3.90 ± 0.67, n = 50 sessions).</p><p id="P8">We expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP7f<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> in V1 using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and measured responses of layer 2/3 neurons using two-photon calcium imaging during the task. We compared the responses to the same pair of visual stimuli in the attend and ignore conditions, and observed a robust modulation of stimulus responses with attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These response changes modified stimulus selectivity (difference in the responses to the rewarded and unrewarded grating stimuli, normalized by the pooled standard deviation) such that cells preferring both the rewarded and unrewarded grating stimuli showed increased stimulus selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Across the population, we observed individual cells increasing their stimulus selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>) and a broadening of the distribution of stimulus selectivity with attention due to more positive and more negative values, indicating higher preference for the rewarded and non-rewarded stimuli respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Consequently, the absolute stimulus selectivity of the neural population increased significantly with attention, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, average absolute selectivity ignore, 0.35 ± 0.10 median ± IQR, attend 0.61 ± 0.28, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 7.56×10<sup>-10</sup>, N = 50 sessions, 15 mice). The increase in stimulus selectivity could not be accounted for by changes in running or licking behaviour, and remained after removing cells most influenced by running and licking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We restricted the analysis to cells which significantly increased their selectivity for either stimulus with attention and found that a combination of increased responses to the preferred and decreased responses to the non-preferred stimuli led to the increase in average selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p id="P9">These results established that visual stimulus selectivity in V1 was strongly modulated in this attention switching task. A candidate mechanism for this selectivity modulation is VIP interneuron mediated disinhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To test the role of VIP interneurons in attentional modulation, we first asked whether optogenetic VIP activation within physiological levels modified neural activity in the same mice passively viewing stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>VIP activation strongly modulates cortical responses</title><p id="P10">To study the effect of activating VIP interneurons on visual stimulus responses, we expressed the red-shifted excitatory opsin Chrimson selectively in VIP interneurons and GCaMP7f non-selectively in V1 neurons using AAVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We used an all-optical approach where we photoactivated VIP interneurons while measuring the activity of VIP and non-VIP cells in the same local circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the population of all non-VIP cells is dominated by pyramidal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> for analysis of identified cell classes)</p><p id="P11">VIP interneurons were robustly activated by increasing light powers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). For each imaged site, we conducted a calibration session in which we increased the light power until we reached a plateau of VIP interneuron activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and chose a ‘low’ and ‘high’ light power based on the shape of this curve (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>). These light powers were typically 0.6 mW (low, range 0.5 to 0.6 mW) and 1.5 mW (high, range 1.5 to 2.25 mW) although tailored values were selected for each site. We established that our photoactivation was within a physiological range by comparing the response amplitude of VIP interneurons during photoactivation and during spontaneous running bouts. Both low and high light powers evoked activity in VIP interneurons which spanned the activity range naturally observed during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, mean VIP interneuron activity with low and high light power, 1.32 and 1.77 ΔF/F respectively. Mean 75<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of activity during locomotion without photostimulation for all VIP interneurons, 1.23, and 2.06 ΔF/F respectively).</p><p id="P12">We photoactivated VIP interneurons while we passively presented a range of oriented drifting grating stimuli to the mice. We confirmed that VIP interneurons increased their activity at each grating direction with increasing light power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). As a result, non-VIP cell stimulus responses were strongly positively modulated at each direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). By comparing the average responses at each direction, we found that VIP interneuron activation caused a largely multiplicative enhancement in orientation-tuned non-VIP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> right, linear regression here and below, low power: slope = 1.568, intercept = 0.009, high power: slope = 1.634, intercept = 0.032, n = 1044 cells, 8 mice). Identical analysis on control mice with the same light stimulation but no opsin expression did not show any significant changes in activity, ruling out light-evoked artefacts at this light power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). Since a purely multiplicative increase in activity is unlikely to lead to changes in stimulus selectivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, these results indicated that VIP interneurons may not be involved in the stimulus selectivity modulations we observed with attention. However, directly testing this hypothesis required studying VIP activity during the attention-switching task.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Testing the interaction between VIP activation and attention</title><p id="P13">To understand the role of VIP interneurons in attentional modulation, we first asked to what extent the activity of VIP interneurons themselves was modulated in this attention switching task. We compared the attend and ignore conditions and found a small but significant difference in pre-stimulus VIP interneuron activity, with higher activity in the attend condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). However, this could be accounted for by a difference in pre-stimulus running speed in the two blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), and correcting for the pre-stimulus activity resulted in no significant difference in stimulus evoked VIP interneuron activity between the attend and ignore conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). This suggested that VIP interneurons are not important in producing attentional modulation.</p><p id="P14">However, to conclusively determine whether VIP activity underlies attentional modulation, we photoactivated VIP interneurons in randomly interleaved trials while mice performed the attention-switching task with the light-on period from 100ms before the grating stimulus onset until 1.5s after grating stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Photoactivation had no effect on the behaviour itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a, b</xref>) possibly because the contralateral hemisphere was unperturbed. The activity of VIP interneurons during the task was again enhanced with increasing light power, both when the visual stimuli were attended and ignored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, top), and this led to an increase in non-VIP cell stimulus evoked activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, bottom).</p><p id="P15">To study the interaction of VIP activation with attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity, we selected all non-VIP neurons which showed a significant increase in stimulus selectivity with attention. The responses of this population to the two grating stimuli in the ignore and attend conditions, with and without VIP photoactivation showed modulatory effects of both attention and VIP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, cells with preference for the unrewarded stimulus, similar effects seen for cells with a preference for the rewarded stimulus, data now shown). Increasing light power evenly increased average (0 to 1s) activity of this population in both ignore and attend conditions, for both the preferred and unpreferred stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We performed a two-way ANOVA and found a significant main effect for both attention and VIP activation, but no significant interaction effect (rewarded stimulus: main effect for attention p = 1.31×10<sup>-05</sup> and VIP activation p = 1.70×10<sup>-05</sup>, no interaction effect p = 0.688). Similar results of no interaction between attention and VIP activation were obtained for the unrewarded stimulus and from cells with a preference for the rewarded stimulus (data not shown), as well as in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1-6</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Having found no interaction between attention and VIP activation on stimulus evoked responses, we asked whether there was any change in stimulus selectivity with VIP activation in either the ignore or attend condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). We performed a two-way ANOVA on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> (all non-VIP cells which significantly increased their selectivity with attention) and found a significant main effect on selectivity from attention (p = 2.44×10<sup>-11</sup>), but not from VIP activation (p = 0.46) and no interaction effect (p = 0.15). The same result was obtained when taking all non-VIP cells (a significant main effect on selectivity from attention, p = 4.50×10<sup>-4</sup>, but not from VIP activation, p = 0.06 and no interaction effect, p = 0.33). Crucially, in the control mice expressing tdTomato only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), there was also only a significant effect on selectivity from attention (p = 2.69×10<sup>-17</sup>), but not from light delivery (p = 0.36) and no interaction effect (p = 0.48). Thus, attention and VIP-driven disinhibition both induce robust modulation of the same neural population, but the two effects do not interact.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>VIP inhibition leads to a modest suppression of cortical responses during passive viewing</title><p id="P17">Although the above results demonstrated that VIP activation did not interact with attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity, to better understand the role of VIP interneurons in shaping cortical stimulus evoked responses we next studied the effect of inhibiting VIP interneurons. We used a similar all-optical approach, by expressing the inhibitory opsin ArchT in VIP interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). VIP interneurons were progressively inhibited by increasing light powers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As with VIP activation, we conducted a calibration session for each site in which we increased the light power until we reached a floor of VIP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and chose a single light power based on the shape of this curve, typically 1.5mW (range 1.15 to 1.8mW, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We photoinhibited VIP interneurons while passively presenting drifting visual grating stimuli to the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, left). VIP interneurons decreased activity at each grating direction with photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, right, slope = 0.748, intercept = -0.012, n = 122 cells). As a result, stimulus responses of orientation selective non-VIP cells were moderately but significantly inhibited at specific directions, including at the peaks of the tuning curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, slope = 0.965, intercept = -0.005, n = 953 cells). To confirm that we had inhibited VIP interneurons to minimal activity levels, we tested another group of mice in which we presented low contrast grating stimuli which activate VIP interneurons more strongly than high contrast stimuli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. When we combined stimulus presentation with VIP photoinhibition, VIP interneuron activity was reduced to the same level whether they were highly active or less active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). VIP inhibition in both cases was accompanied by reductions in non-VIP cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). This confirmed that our photoinhibition was appropriate for reducing VIP activity to near the minimum physiological levels. Thus, VIP inhibition during passive viewing of visual stimuli led to a modest inhibition of non-VIP cell activity. However, to establish whether VIP interneurons are required for attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity we next studied the effects of inhibition of VIP activity during the attention-switching task.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>VIP inactivation during attention-switching</title><p id="P19">To conclusively rule out the role of VIP interneurons in attentional modulation of stimulus selectivity, we photoinhibited VIP interneurons in randomly interleaved trials while mice performed the attention-switching task, with the light on period from 100ms before the grating stimulus onset until the end of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As with photoactivation, photoinhibition had no effect on the mouse behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c, d</xref>). VIP interneurons were inhibited during the behaviour, both when the visual stimuli were attended and ignored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, top). However, we observed no effect of VIP inhibition on stimulus responses of non-VIP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, bottom). To confirm that there was no deficit in the degree of our photoinhibition, we applied an average of 7.5 mW light power (range 5.7 to 9 mW), higher than the 1.5 mW used so far. We found no further reduction in VIP interneuron activity at this higher light power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the higher light power led to a significant increase in measured neural activity in the tdTomato control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). This revealed the potential for artefactual results with the higher light power, possibly induced through direct retinal activation and subtle changes in behaviour linked to light onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c, d</xref>). These results illustrate the importance of light-only controls in animals performing the full behavioural task and confirmed that our photoinhibition of VIP interneurons at 1.5 mW was close to complete.</p><p id="P20">To study the interaction of VIP inhibition with attention, we selected all non-VIP neurons which showed a significant increase in stimulus selectivity with attention. The response of this population to the two grating stimuli in the ignore and attend conditions, with and without VIP photoinhibition showed no effect of VIP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, average of all cells with preference for unrewarded stimulus). Increasing light power had no effect on the average (0 to 1s) activity of this population in either ignore or attend conditions, for either the preferred or non-preferred stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). We performed a two-way ANOVA for the rewarded stimulus responses and found a significant main effect for attention (p = 0.001) but not for VIP inhibition (p = 0.80), and no significant interaction effect (p = 0.97).

The same result was obtained when taking all non-VIP cells (a significant main effect on selectivity from attention, p = 1.72×10<sup>-10</sup>, but not from VIP activation, p = 0.89 and no interaction effect, p = 0.73).

To address this question, we asked if these two modulations were orthogonal to each other. We performed dimensionality reduction using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and found two axes best separating the visual stimulus-evoked neural activity of the non-VIP population: first between attend and ignore conditions, and second between photoactivation and no photoactivation conditions (VIP activation, VIP inhibition and control) within the ignore condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We found the cosine similarity of these two axes as a measure of the alignment of the attentional and optogenetic manipulations.</p><p id="P24">For comparison, we created a null distribution of cosine similarity between randomly chosen pairs of axes from the dataset based on the covariance of the original data (10,000 samples, same method as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>). We compared the cosine similarity of the LDA axes of modulation by attention and modulation by VIP manipulation for each session to its random mean. In the VIP activation experiment, the angle between attention and VIP modulations had a significantly lower cosine similarity value than the random vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.009, n = 17 sessions), demonstrating that they were significantly less aligned than random axes drawn from the same space occupied by the data.

As a positive control, we confirmed that in all three groups, the vectors separating the two visual stimuli responses from two halves of the data had significantly higher cosine similarity than random vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Chrimson p = 2.93×10<sup>-04</sup>, ArchT p = 6.43×10<sup>-04</sup>, tdTomato p = 0.002. n = 16, n = 17, and n = 17 sessions respectively). These results demonstrate that not only do attention and VIP modulation not interact, but they are also orthogonal to each other.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Distinct mechanisms of changes during attention and VIP modulation</title><p id="P26">Having established that VIP-induced and attention-induced modulations do not interact and are in fact orthogonal, we wished to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying these two modulations and to establish how similar or distinct they were. Although cortical VIP interneurons are known to strongly inhibit SOM interneurons and thus disinhibit pyramidal neurons, these cells are embedded in highly recurrently connected networks with strong connectivity across cell classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. It is thus often not clear how the perturbation of one cell class influences the rest of the network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. In fact, the effect of VIP activation leading to SOM inhibition and thus PYR disinhibition has never been demonstrated in simultaneously measured VIP, SOM and PYR cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P27">To establish the cell class-specific consequences of our optogenetic VIP activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we reidentified the same neurons in co-registered, immunohistochemically stained brain sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> in 4 out of 8 of the same animals expressing Chrimson in VIP interneurons, and detected simultaneously imaged PV, SOM and VIP positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The remaining cells were classified as putative PYR cells. We could thus measure the effect of VIP photoactivation on the activity of multiple simultaneously measured cell classes. VIP photoactivation during passive grey screen viewing led to increasing disinhibition of PYR and PV cells with increasing light power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a-e</xref>). VIP photoactivation during passive presentation of oriented drifting grating stimuli showed, as expected, a strong enhancement of VIP and PYR cell responses. Crucially, at the same time we saw a suppression of SOM cell activity on average, and an enhancement of PV cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b, c, d</xref>). This is consistent with VIP photoactivation leading to disinhibition of PYR and PV cells via direct inhibition of SOM interneurons.</p><p id="P28">The direction tuning curves of each cell class measured during passive viewing were also modulated following a similar pattern, with PYR (high power, slope = 1.452, intercept = 0.042, n = 472 cells), PV (slope = 1.304, intercept = 0.125, n = 40 cells) and VIP (slope = 1.489, intercept = 0.567, n = 85 cells) cell activity largely enhanced and SOM (slope = 0.690, intercept = 0.019, n = 30 cells) cell activity largely inhibited at all stimulus directions during VIP photoactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5f-j</xref>). These results demonstrated that VIP interneuron activation drives network-wide changes in all major cell classes and confirmed that activating VIP interneurons within physiological levels leads to disinhibition of PYR cells through SOM inhibition. The enhanced activity of PV cells with VIP activation demonstrated that the direct inhibition of PV cells by VIP cells was reversed by other network effects, which we explored in a circuit model below.</p><p id="P29">If attention and VIP modulations are indeed orthogonal, we would expect the underlying mechanisms of changes induced by either of them to be distinct. We tested this using different measures. First, as shown above, attention led to both increases and decreases in average stimulus evoked activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>), but VIP activation only induced increases in stimulus evoked activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, d</xref>). Second, we measured noise correlations between the 4 cell classes we had recorded from simultaneously. Noise correlations were measured as the stimulus-independent trial-to-trial co-variability of responses, and thus provided an estimate of mutual connectivity and shared inputs between and within cell classes. We found that attention significantly increased noise correlation between VIP cell pairs and significantly decreased the correlation between PYR and SOM, SOM and VIP and PV and SOM cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>). In contrast, VIP activation significantly decreased noise correlation between PYR, VIP and PV cell pairs as well as between PYR and VIP, PV and VIP and SOM and VIP cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). P-values (uncorrected, unrewarded visual stimulus) for changes with attention are PYR-PYR: p = 0.320, VIP-VIP: p = 0.005, SOM-SOM: p = 0.966, PV-PV: p = 0.123, PV-VIP: p = 0.278, PYR-PV: p = 0.054, PYR-VIP: p = 0.123, PV-SOM: p = 0.014, PYR-SOM: p = 0.019, SOM-VIP: p = 0.005; for changes with VIP photoactivation, PYR-PYR: p = 0.010, VIP-VIP: p = 0.001, SOM-SOM: p = 0.240, PV-PV: p = 0.019, PV-VIP: p = 0.010, PYR-PV: p = 0.067, PYR-VIP: p = 0.032, PV-SOM: p = 0.083, PYR-SOM: p = 0.278, SOM-VIP: p = 0.003.</p><p id="P30">Third, we studied how attention and VIP photoactivation modified stimulus evoked activity across the populations of these 4 cell classes. We found a heterogeneity in the responses to visual stimuli in all cell classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). By measuring the difference in stimulus evoked responses between attend and ignore conditions for each neuron, we found that in the absence of photoactivation, attention led to heterogeneous changes, marked by a prominent reduction in evoked activity in all four cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>). In contrast, VIP photoactivation led to predominantly enhanced activity in VIP, PV and PYR neurons, and largely suppressed activity in SOM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7h</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Fourth, we directly compared the degree of selectivity modulation by attention and activity modulation by VIP activation on neurons from each cell class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7i</xref>). We found no strong correlation in any cell class, ruling out the possibility of a specific subset of cells driving both attentional and VIP-driven changes (Pearson’s correlation coefficients -0.05, 0.03, 0.05, -0.1 in VIP, SOM, PV and PYR cells respectively). In fact, we found a small but significant negative correlation in PYR (p = 3.4×10<sup>-6</sup>) and VIP interneurons (p = 0.015, all other ps &gt; 0.05), suggesting a moderate segregation of attention and VIP modulations across these cell populations. Overall, these results demonstrate that attention changes V1 stimulus processing by heterogeneous changes in activity and correlations across different cell classes, whereas VIP activation drives relatively homogenous enhancement of PYR and PV cell activity along with SOM inhibition. Thus, attention and VIP disinhibition act on the same cortical circuit through distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A circuit model captures the effects of both attention and VIP perturbations</title><p id="P32">Our results raised an important question regarding cortical circuit architecture: How can attention and VIP modulation each profoundly affect the same cell populations and yet not interact? Cortical circuits have structured connections between cell classes and receive targeted bottom-up and top-down inputs. What circuit architecture can account for increased stimulus selectivity through top-down attentional inputs, modulation of PYR, PV and SOM cells through VIP activation, and no interaction between these two effects? To address this question, we developed a theoretical model of the excitatory and inhibitory circuit enabling us to determine what patterns of connectivity and external inputs could explain the results of both attentional and VIP-driven modulations of the same circuit.</p><p id="P33">In this model, we represented the four cell types PYR, PV, SOM, and VIP by their population activity. The activity of each population was determined by baseline activity, bottom-up stimulus-related input, top-down attentional input, and connection strengths with other cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). We used experimentally derived connectivity values from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and used simulation-based inference (SBI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> to determine connectivity values from PYR to all interneurons, SOM to PV cells, bottom-up, top-down and baseline inputs which replicated a number of experimental findings, importantly that of non-interacting attention and VIP modulations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>).</p><p id="P34">We confirmed that the model reproduced the suppression of SOM and enhancement of PYR and PV activity during VIP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). We next compared activity with and without attentional top-down inputs, focusing on PYR and PV cells since these cells showed a robust increase in stimulus selectivity, uninfluenced by overt movements (PYR average absolute selectivity, ignore 0.43 ± 0.77 [mean ± SD], attend 0.49 ± 0.52, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 7.02x10<sup>-21</sup>, N = 1616.

The model reproduced the increase in PYR and PV stimulus selectivity through a combination of increased and decreased responses to the preferred and non-preferred stimuli respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Crucially, the model captured the non-interacting nature of attention and VIP modulations. VIP activation enhanced PYR activity almost equally in the ignore and attend conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>), closely matching the experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This led to small changes in stimulus selectivity with VIP activation, but large selectivity changes with attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The model responses to VIP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8g</xref>) also closely followed experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d-e</xref>), even though this observation was not used to constrain the model. The model thus revealed a precise network architecture capable of sustaining strong yet non-interacting modulations by attention and VIP activation.</p><p id="P35">Our model allowed us to ask which cell class might receive the strongest top-down inputs to account for the data. We explored the parameter distribution which satisfied the data and found that PV cells received the strongest top-down inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8h</xref>). Furthermore, top-down inputs arriving on PYR cells were tightly correlated with those arriving on PV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8h</xref>), suggesting that the relative strength of top-down inputs on PYR and PV cells is highly regulated.</p><p id="P36">Finally, we explored the origin of the experimental finding that VIP activation led to enhanced activity not only in PYR cells but prominently in PV cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7b-d</xref>). The enhancement of PV cell activity with VIP activation may be a result of disinhibition through SOM cells, since SOM cells inhibit PV cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, or a consequence of elevated PYR activity leading to increased PV cell activity through PYR to PV connections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, or a combination of the two effects. Our circuit model allowed us to test which of these scenarios was more likely. In our model, we first set the connectivity weight from SOM to PV cells to zero and compared the response of PV cells with and without VIP activation. We found a minimal effect of deleting the SOM to PV connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8i</xref>). In contrast, when we deleted the connection from PYR to PV cells we found strongly reduced PV responses which were not affected by VIP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8j</xref>). These results suggest that VIP activation first suppresses SOM cells, leading to enhanced PYR activity due to disinhibition, which subsequently increases PV activity through PYR to PV connections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P37">In this study we demonstrate that attention leads to modulation in stimulus response properties of V1 neurons resulting in increased stimulus selectivity. We further demonstrate that VIP-SOM disinhibition leads to strong modulations in V1 stimulus response properties. Critically, however, these two modulations do not interact, and are in fact orthogonal to each other at the population level. Inhibition of VIP interneurons leaves attentional modulation unperturbed, and VIP interneurons themselves are not modulated by attention, confirming the lack of involvement of VIP interneurons in generating attentional modulation. Consistent with this conclusion, attention and VIP modulations are accompanied by distinct patterns of changes of activity and interactions between excitatory and different inhibitory cell classes.

However, it is challenging to test hypotheses about the circuit basis of cognitive phenomena since this requires the measurement and manipulation of neural circuit components as animals perform a cognitive task. In this study we have aimed to advance this approach, by simultaneously measuring the activity of four cell classes while manipulating the activity of one of these cell classes, as animals switched between distinct attentional states. Using this approach, we were also able to calibrate our circuit manipulations to ensure they spanned a physiologically relevant range. As a result, we established that VIP cells are not the route through which top-down attentional signals influence activity in V1.</p><p id="P39">An alternative explanation may be that a specific pattern of individual VIP cell activation needs to be engaged by attentional signals, and our non-specific full-field photoactivation approach is insufficient to rule out the role of VIP interneurons in attention modulation. However, this argument is refuted by our findings that VIP interneuron inhibition resulted in no changes to attentional modulations, and that VIP interneuron responses themselves were not modulated by attention. What alternative local circuits might then be involved in implementing the observed attentional modulations? One possibility is that attention induces selective suppression through PV interneurons, which themselves show strong attentional modulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, and may be capable of enhancing stimulus selectivity and discrimination behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.

Visual stimuli were generated using psychtoolbox-3 and all behavioural tasks were controlled using custom scripts written in MATLAB and with a Teensy microcontroller board.</p><p id="P54">Mice were first habituated to handling and gentle restraint over two to three days and were then head-fixed and trained to run on a polystyrene cylinder (20cm diameter) for a further one to four days. Mice were free to run on the polystyrene cylinder during all awake recordings and their running speed on this cylinder was measured using an incremental rotary encoder (Kübler).</p><p id="P55">Once mice were running reliably on the wheel, they performed one closed-loop visual discrimination behavioural session during which the movement of the mouse on the wheel controlled the movement of visual gratings on the screen. After this closed-loop session all subsequent sessions were with fixed spatial and temporal frequency of the drifting gratings, and mice were trained to run for sustained periods of time to initiate trials - at least 2.8s with an added random duration drawn from an exponential distribution (mean 0.4s). The stimuli used for visual discrimination were two sinusoidal gratings drifting in the opposite direction to the direction of running, with a fixed spatial and temporal frequency of 0.1 cycles per degree and 2Hz respectively. Unless otherwise specified the rewarded and unrewarded gratings were oriented +/-15° relative to vertical, symmetrically on both screens. The stimulus presented on a given trial was selected at random.</p><p id="P56">The mouse could trigger the release of a drop of soya milk when the rewarded grating was displayed by licking the reward spout during the ‘reward period’. The reward period started 1.5s (with added random duration, mean 0.2s) after the rewarded visual stimulus onset and lasted until the offset of the stimulus 1s later. If the mouse licked during the ‘reward period’ the trial was recorded as a ‘hit’, if the mouse did not lick it was recorded as a ‘miss’ and a drop of soya milk was dispensed automatically shortly before the disappearance of the visual stimulus. Miss trials were rare after the first few days of training. A lick at any time when the unrewarded grating was displayed was recorded as a ‘false alarm’ and the mouse was punished with a 4s time-out period, during which the unrewarded grating persisted on the screen and any more licks reset the time-out duration. Ignoring the unrewarded visual stimulus by not licking was recorded as a ‘correct rejection’. In the initial stages of training, to discourage incorrect licking the probability of unrewarded trials was sometimes temporarily increased from 0.5 to 0.7. Mice typically learned the visual discrimination task in 5-10 days, with the threshold for learning defined as three consecutive days of discrimination with a behavioural d-prime score of 2.0 or above. Behavioural d-prime was calculated as: d’ = Φ<sup>-1</sup> (H) - Φ<sup>-1</sup> (F), where Φ<sup>-1</sup> is the normal inverse cumulative distribution function, H is the rate of hit trials, and F is the rate of false alarm trials.</p><p id="P57">After learning the visual discrimination task, mice were trained to perform odour discrimination. The odour discrimination task was identical in structure to the visual discrimination task except that instead of visual stimuli one of two odour stimuli were presented to the mouse via polyethylene tubing positioned above the snout of the mouse. A custom-built flow-dilution olfactometer calibrated with a mini PID (Aurora) delivered 10-20% saturated vapour concentration of two solutions, 10% soy milk (rewarded odour) and 10% soy milk with 0.1% p-Cymene mixture (unrewarded odour). Mice typically started accurately discriminating between the odours after 30-40 trials, after which they were trained to switch between blocks of the olfactory and visual discrimination task.</p><p id="P58">Mice typically learned to perform the attention switching task in a further 1-3 days. In the olfactory blocks, 70% of odour stimuli were preceded by one of the two visual gratings presented in the visual discrimination task. These irrelevant visual stimuli were displayed for a fixed duration of 1.8s, with an onset delay distribution identical to the visual block, and neither grating was rewarded or punished. Mice learned to accurately discriminate between the odours while ignoring, i.e., not licking in response to either irrelevant grating. One of the two odours followed the irrelevant visual grating offset with a delay of 1.5s, plus an added random duration drawn from an exponential distribution with mean 0.2s.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Optogenetic manipulations</title><p id="P59">Expression of the tdTomato conjugated opsin (Chrimson or ArchT) was first verified in each imaging site through two-photon imaging at 1030nm excitation wavelength. Optogenetic light was delivered using a digitally triggered 637nm laser (OBIS 637nm LX, Coherent), through a 200μm diameter 0.39 NA optic fibre (Thorlabs) positioned above the cranial window. To allow for quasi-simultaneous two-photon imaging and optogenetic activation, the laser and stimulus monitors were blanked during the linear phase of the resonant scanner.</p><p id="P60">For each two-photon imaging site an optogenetic calibration session was performed. During these calibration sessions the screens were grey, and 8 light powers (including 0%) were applied in pseudorandom sequence to the imaging window for 1.5s with 5s intervals. The effective maximum output used in mice expressing ArchT was 9mW, and in mice expressing Chrimson was 3mW. The average activity of each ROI in the 1s before the optogenetic laser onset was subtracted from the light period and the resulting baseline corrected activity was used for the calibration plots. Based on the shape of these calibration curves, 2 powers were chosen for the behavioural task for each imaging site: the lowest power producing a saturated or just below saturated response, and a second power with approximately half of this effect.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Direction tuning</title><p id="P61">To examine the effect of the optogenetic light on visual processing in mice passively viewing stimuli, two-photon imaging sessions were conducted while head-fixed mice (free to run on a polystyrene wheel) were shown sinusoidal visual gratings drifting in one of 8 directions separated by 45°, with a spatial frequency of 0.1 cycles per degree and temporal frequency of 2Hz. These visual stimuli were randomly interleaved and one of three laser powers (including 0%, the same as those used in the attention switching task) was selected with equal probability for each visual stimulus presentation. The visual gratings were presented for 2s and the optogenetic laser lasted from 100ms before the stimulus onset to 1.5s after the start of stimulus presentation. There was a 5s interval before the start of the next visual stimulus presentation.</p><p id="P62">Direction tuning curves were constructed for each cell using their mean responses to each direction after baseline correction.

This prevented artefactual results which would occur from selecting the maximum firing rate in one condition (e.g., no light) and comparing this to other conditions (e.g., optogenetic stimulation).

Optogenetic laser powers were interleaved and randomly selected on each trial from 1 of 3 powers (No laser, low power, high power) with equal probability. The optogenetic laser was on from 100ms before stimulus presentation to 1.5s after visual stimulus onset in Chrimson mice, or to the offset of the visual stimulus for ArchT mice. The optogenetic laser was delivered only during presentation of the visual stimuli in both the visual and odour blocks.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P66">Pre-processing of two-photon calcium imaging data was performed using the software Suite2p (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p">https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p</ext-link>) to correct for motion, detect regions of interest (ROIs) and extract the raw fluorescence time series of those ROIs, F(t). Each site yielded between 164 and 688 cells, median = 432 cells. We corrected the calcium traces for out of focus neuropil fluorescence using the neuropil masks identified by suite2p. For each frame we subtracted 0.7 * (neuropil - median neuropil fluorescence). Subsequent analysis unless otherwise specified was done with custom code in MATLAB and Python. Baseline fluorescence F0(t) was computed by smoothing F(t) (causal moving average of 0.75s) and taking the 2.5th percentile of the smoothed data. The change in fluorescence relative to baseline, ΔF/F, was computed by taking the difference between F and F0, and dividing by F0. Video recording (The Imaging Source) of the eye contralateral to the imaging site was performed during all sessions, and the time-points of saccades and blinks identified. Frames in which the mouse made a saccade or blinked were removed from further analysis. To identify VIP interneurons labelled with tdTomato <italic>in vivo</italic>, a brief dual channel recording of the imaging planes in red and green was taken before each imaging session at an excitation wavelength of 1020nm.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Behavioural controls</title><p id="P67">To assess the proportion of neural activity which was attributable to overt behaviour recorded during our task, a linear model was fit using ridge regression to predict neural activity. The model was constructed by combining multiple sets of variables into a design matrix, to capture signal modulation by the following different task or behavioural events: 2 visual stimuli, 2 odour stimuli, reward delivery, licks, running speed, block type, and an interaction term for visual stimuli and block type. Each stimulus/event variable was structured to capture a time-varying event kernel. Variables therefore consisted of a vector of the relevant stimulus/event, and copies of this vector, each shifted in time by one frame for specific durations. For sensory stimuli, the time-shifted copies ranged up to 2s after the original. For motor events (running and licking) the time-shifted copies spanned the frames from 0.5s before until 2s after the original. The model was fit with 5-fold cross validation and the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was calculated based on the predictions of the model on held out data not used during training. We then assessed the predictive power of the behavioural model variables by comparing the R<sup>2</sup> value for the full model to a model without the running and licking predictors, taking the proportion 1-(no behaviour model R<sup>2</sup>)/(full model R<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="P68">To decode block type based on neural activity or running speed the neural decoding toolbox readout.info was used with the max_correlation_coefficient_CL classifier. To separate sessions according to their time-point of divergence in running speed the pre-stimulus baseline speed was subtracted and the first time-point found at which there was a significant difference in running speed between the attended and ignored rewarded visual stimulus trials using Wilcoxon rank sum tests at each time-point.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Selectivity</title><p id="P69">We computed a selectivity index for individual ROIs as the difference between the mean response to each of the two gratings divided by the pooled standard deviation of that ROIs responses. Unless otherwise specified, all selectivity values presented here are from an analysis of the activity in the first 1s of visual stimulus presentation. To calculate ΔSelectivity we took the difference selectivity(attend) - selectivity(ignore). For cells that were negatively selective in the attend condition we multiplied the resultant values by –1, to ensure that cells that became more selective with attention had positive values.</p><p id="P70">To test if an ROI was significantly selective within a certain time window, a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed comparing the activity on trials for the two visual stimuli. ROIs were excluded from further analysis if they displayed selectivity in the period before visual stimuli were presented. To find ROIs that significantly changed their selectivity with attention, an ROI’s selectivity in the attend condition was compared to a distribution produced through bootstrapping using the data in the ignore condition (1000 repeats). If the attend selectivity was below or above the 2.5<sup>th</sup> or 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles respectively of the bootstrapped distribution, then the ROI was considered to have significantly changed its selectivity with attention. To avoid artefactual effects from selecting cells in one condition and testing in another, the test for significance was performed with no light and all light powers pooled.</p><p id="P71">After each behavioural block transition, transient periods of less accurate behaviour were discarded by identifying the trial in each block beyond which behaviour was stably accurate, that is, where mice displayed greater than 75% accuracy on both the go and no-go stimuli for the remainder of the block, and for the odour block, where mice licked in response to fewer than 25% of either of the irrelevant visual gratings for the remainder of the block. Light and no light trials were pooled to identify this point to avoid artefactual results.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Orthogonality</title><p id="P72">Visualisation of the LDA transformation of neural activity was done using the Python library scikit-learn. All other analysis for testing orthogonality was done on axes found in MATLAB using the fitcdiscr function. The alignment of the axes best separating the optogenetic modulation and attentional modulation were found through the cosine similarity of the coefficients of two linear discriminant analysis models. One model separated visual stimulus trials in the odour block from visual stimulus trials in the visual block, both sets of trials without the optogenetic perturbation. The second model separated visual stimulus trials in the odour block without optogenetic perturbation from visual stimulus trials in the odour block with optogenetic perturbation.</p><p id="P73">The cosine similarity for the split data control was found using a similar approach. In the visual block, the rewarded and unrewarded visual stimulus trials were separated into two halves and the coefficients used to calculate cosine similarity were for two models separating the rewarded and unrewarded trials using non-overlapping halves of the data. This process was repeated 50 times for each session and the resulting values were averaged to produce one value for cosine similarity for split data for each session.</p><p id="P74">To ensure that we do not obtain orthogonal axes simply because they lie within a high-dimensional neural subspace, random axes were found using the method from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

There were 14 trial types in total, rewarded and unrewarded odour stimuli, and rewarded and unrewarded visual stimuli in the visual and odour blocks, all at multiple laser powers. The Pearson correlation coefficient was then used to quantify the correlation between responses of pairs of cells for each trial type. Changes in noise correlations between different cell types with attention or optogenetic modulation were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on all sessions for which the post-hoc immunomatching had been successful (n = 4 mice).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Circuit model</title><p id="P76">We modelled a circuit consisting of an excitatory population of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (PYR), and three inhibitory populations, corresponding to PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons.

Optogenetic light stimulation happened at the same time as stimulus presentation. During light stimulation, we set the activity of the VIP population to a fixed value such that the normalized response was 2.0, in the case of VIP activation or 0 in the case of VIP inactivation.

Left to right: VIP n = 85 cells, SOM n = 30 cells, PV n = 40 cells, PYR n = 1567 cells. <bold>c</bold>) Mean of each column of b, showing average change in activity with VIP activation, shading indicates SEM. <bold>d</bold>) Box plots of visual stimulus evoked activity with and without VIP photoactivation, averaged 0 to 1s from visual stimulus onset, for each cell class (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for differences in activity: PYR, n = 1567 cells, p = 4.52×10<sup>-187</sup>; SOM, n = 30 cells, p = 5.71×10<sup>-04</sup>; VIP, n = 85 cells, p = 1.17×10<sup>-15</sup>; PV, n = 40 cells, p = 3.57×10<sup>-08</sup>). <bold>e</bold>) Mean noise correlations between cell pairs belonging to the same or different cell classes, in the ignore and attend conditions, without photoactivation. Error bars represent SEM here and below (n = 11 sessions, 4 mice). Inset: Changes in noise correlations due to attention as indicated by line thickness and colour code. Shorter line segments indicate change in noise correlations between cells of the same type. <bold>f</bold>) Same as e, for noise correlations with and without VIP photoactivation in the attend condition. <bold>g</bold>) Top, difference in mean visual stimulus evoked response with attention (baseline subtracted, unrewarded grating), for each cell type, aligned to visual stimulus onset (dashed line). Cells are sorted by their average activity in the ignore condition (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Bottom, average responses of cells from the top, middle and bottom 10th percentiles of the difference in responses (averaged 0-1s) with attention shown above. Shaded area indicates SEM. <bold>h</bold>) Same as g but for differences in mean visual stimulus evoked response with photoactivation of VIP interneurons (red bar and shading) compared to no photoactivation in the ignore condition. Top, cells are sorted the same as in g, by their average activity in the ignore condition. <bold>i</bold>) Relationship between ΔSelectivity with attention (positive values indicate increased stimulus selectivity with attention) and change in stimulus evoked activity with VIP photoactivation (mean 0-1s, baseline subtracted), for VIP (N = 130 cells), SOM (N = 50 cells), PV (N = 67 cells) and PYR cells (N = 1616 cells, 4 mice). Cells with values greater than the axes limits were pegged to the axes. Significant negative correlations were present only in VIP and PYR cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157801-f007"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Circuit modelling reveals a network architecture for independent attentional and VIP modulations</title><p><bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the model architecture, indicating connectivity between different cell classes, bottom up (stim) and top-down inputs (attention), and VIP photoactivation. <bold>b</bold>) Simulated responses of the 4 cell types to a visual stimulus with and without VIP photoactivation. <bold>c</bold>) Experimental results, average responses to the preferred and non-preferred visual stimuli in the ignore and attend conditions for positively selective cells that significantly increased their stimulus selectivity with attention, for PYR (left, n = 289 cells,) and PV cells (right, n = 15 cells), error bars indicate SEM.
