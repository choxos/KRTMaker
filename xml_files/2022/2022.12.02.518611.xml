To fill this gap, we used a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and the determination of LNP pH gradient to analyze the nanoparticles (NPs) in BNT162b2 (Comirnaty), comparing it with the well characterized pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Comirnaty NPs had similar size to Doxil, however, unlike Doxil liposomes, wherein the stable ammonium and pH gradient enables accumulation of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>C-methylamine in the intraliposomal aqueous phase, Comirnaty LNPs lack such pH gradient in spite of the fact that the pH 4, at which LNPs are prepared, is raised to pH 7.2 after loading of the mRNA. Mechanical manipulation of Comirnaty NPs with AFM revealed soft, compliant structures. The sawtooth-like force transitions seen during cantilever retraction implies that molecular strands, corresponding to mRNA, can be pulled out of NPs, and the process is accompanied by stepwise rupture of mRNA-lipid bonds. Unlike Doxil, cryo-TEM of Comirnaty NPs revealed a granular, solid core enclosed by mono- and bilayers. Negative staining TEM shows 2-5 nm electron-dense spots in the liposom's interior that are aligned into strings, semicircles, or labyrinth-like networks, which may imply crosslink-stabilized supercoils. The neutral intra-LNP core questions the dominance of ionic interactions holding together this scaffold, raising the alternative possibility of hydrogen bonding between the mRNA and the lipids. Such interaction, described previously for another mRNA/lipid complex, is consistent with the steric structure of ionizable lipid in Comirnaty, ALC-0315, displaying free =O and -OH groups. It is hypothesized that the latter groups can get into steric positions that enable hydrogen bonding with the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA. These newly recognized structural features of mRNA-LNP may be important for the vaccine's efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>PEGylated lIPCsomes</kwd><kwd>Doxil</kwd><kwd>Pfizer/BioNTech/BNT162b2/Comirnaty vaccine</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>dynamic light scattering</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd><kwd>nanoindentation</kwd><kwd>force spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>mechanical resilience</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The worldwide use of Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty (BNT162b2) and Moderna's Spikevax (mRNA-1273) vaccines against Covid-19 brought substantial public and scientific interest and scrutiny. They represent a new approach of immunization based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs), wherein the mRNA encodes the virus's spike protein (S-protein). Following translation, the protein presents antigen for the immune system to develop specific immunity against the virus. This approach of vaccination stems from the success of LNPs in gene therapy and lipophilic drug delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> that utilizes ionizable lipids displaying positive charge at low pH (IPC lipids), neutral PEGylated lipids, neutral membrane-forming phospholipids and cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> However, the compact LNPs are very different from the clinically applied bilayer liposomes with clearly discernible internal aqueous compartment. Yet there is little information about the molecular buildup of fully filled LNPs in general, and Comirnaty in particular. Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to employ a combination of state-of-art nanostructure analysis techniques to better understand the structure of Comirnaty in comparison with Doxil, a well-characterized liposome control, whose chemical composition is compared to that of Comirnaty in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P4">We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force spectroscopy to unveil the 3D-shape and nanomechanical properties of Comirnaty, dynamic light scattering (DLS) to ascertain the averaged hydrodynamic size of NPs, cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to image the individual LNPs, their size and shape and internal fine structure, and radiolabel equilibrium measurements to explore the presence of a pH gradient and permeability of the LNP coating layer to small molecules, and to measure intraparticle pH. Our data, taken together with a recent description of IPC lipid clusters binding to mRNA with hydrogen bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> led us to propose a new model of Comirnaty structure wherein the mRNA supercoils are stabilized by hydrogen bonds with IPC-lipids with weaker or absent ionic interactions, and intermittent mono- and bilayered membranes making up the coat.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>AFM images of Comirnaty as administered in people and after storage of expired samples</title><p id="P5">This study focuses on the structure of Comirnaty as administered to people, also noting changes observed after 1 day storage at 4°C, which is irrelevant regarding the human application of the vaccine but reveals information that help understanding the structure of these NPs.</p><p id="P6"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows AFM images of Comirnaty and Doxil NPs under different conditions with regards to storage time and temperature. It is seen, particularly in the 3D reconstituted versions of images (lower panels), that the freshly diluted vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and E</xref>), representing the inoculum used for injection into humans, consists of monodisperse, spherical NPs of about 120-150 nm apparent diameter and 40-60 nm topographical height (54.6±19.3 nm, mean ± SD, n=148), corresponding to slightly flattened surface-adsorbed NPs. One-day storage of diluted vaccine at 4°C, which represents samples not recommended for human use, led to striking differences in sample morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B and F</xref>). Namely, both the size and shape of NPs became heterogeneous, and large flat patches were visible on the supporting surface. Refreezing the stored samples, which, too, is excluded by the manufacturer for human use, led to even more heterogeneous, disperse NPs with substantial variety of fragment shapes in the ~5 to ~300 nm range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and G</xref>). The freshly opened Doxil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D and H</xref>) showed similar monodisperse, spherical NPs as are the freshly suspended Comirnaty NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A and E</xref>) but their topographical height was lower (28.5±7.8 nm, mean ± SD).</p><p id="P7">Regarding the morphological changes of Comirnaty upon storage, as shown by AFM, the increase of particle size without segmentation and losing of smooth surface may be explained by time-dependent association of NPs, most likely via fusion. The decrease of particle size, in turn, suggests that loss of phospholipids has occurred in some liposomes, giving rise of flat patches in the background that correspond to lipid layers stretched on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B, F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DLS analysis of the hydrodynamic size and size distribution of freshly diluted Comirnaty and Doxil</title><p id="P8">As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the freshly diluted Comirnaty and Doxil NPs had essentially similar hydrodynamic size (diameter: 80-85 nm), but the homogeneity of Comirnaty was slightly lower than that of Doxil, as reflected in the higher span of size distribution and higher polydispersity index (Pdi) of Comirnaty NPs compared to Doxil. Also, the surface charge (Zp) of Doxil (-31 +/- 5.1 (mean +/- SD, n=3) was more negative than that of Comirnaty (8.6 +/- 5.3, mean +/- SD, n= 3), as determined in 1.5 mM sodium nitrate. Nevertheless, these data are consistent with the AFM images inasmuch as both preparations consist of spherical NPs of about the same size. As for the discrepancy between the hydrodynamic diameter measured by DLS and topographical height of NPs, measured by AFM, it can be attributed to the different focuses of the 2 methods; global estimate of NP size in solution vs. 3D shape of individual NPs adhered to a surface, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Nanomechanical properties of freshly diluted Comirnaty NPs</title><p id="P9">To explore the nanomechanical properties of vaccine NPs administered to humans, we analyzed the force-distance curves obtained in freshly diluted Comirnaty samples upon NP indentation with the AFM's cantilever. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> shows a representative force curve recorded during an indentation cycle. During tip approach (red curve), following a constant-force region reflecting the lack of load as the cantilever moved towards the NP surface, a rise in force was apparent (phase 1). The distance (cca. 50 nm) at which the force began to rise, corresponds well to topographical height of NPs, indicating the point of contact between the surface-adsorbed particle and the AFM tip. The apparent linear increase of force is a clear sign of elastic compression of the NP. The slope of the linear fit in this region provided a stiffness of ~9 pN/nm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which is slightly smaller than that of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and an order of magnitude smaller than that of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> with roughly the same radius (i.e., liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered membrane liposomes at room temperature, respectively).</p><p id="P10">At a certain distance, a sudden and considerable force drop leading to high negative force values occurred (phase 2) indicating that the particle surface ruptured and resulted in tip attraction. The distance at which rupture took place was ~40% of the contact-point distance (i.e., contact height), suggesting that the particles could be compressed to almost 1/3 of their height during indentation before they lost their mechanical integrity. The force necessary to pierce through the NP surface (~78 pN, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) was 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that in other ordered nanoscale biomolecular systems, such as liposomes (0.6-1.1 nN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> or empty viral capsids (0.6-5.8 nN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P11">Following the negative force regime, a steep rise of force is seen in the force spectra indicating that the tip reached the hard, incompressible glass substrate below the particle. Upon retraction, initially a negative force region is apparent that can be attributed to adhesive forces between the tip and the nanoparticle content. Following this stage, a region containing sawtoothlike transitions appeared in the force trace (marked by red asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The steady decrease in force (which corresponds to increase in pulling force) is likely to reflect molecular strands (RNA) being pulled out of the particles, while the sudden force transitions are probably due to either the unfolding of RNA or the rupture of interactions between the RNA and lipid components (phases 3-4). The thread-like behavior reflects the properties of the RNA strand. The superimposition of retraction force traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) failed to reveal preferred distances at which transitions occur. The number of force sawteeth ranged from a few (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) to several (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C/2</xref>). The mean force associated with the sawtooth peaks was 42.7 pN (see peak force distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), which exceeds the force necessary for opening RNA hairpins (13-14 pN),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> suggesting that the observed transitions are the result of lipid-RNA interactions rather than RNA unfolding events. At the last transition, during which force returned to zero (i.e., no load on the cantilever), RNA was either pulled completely out of the particle or detached from the AFM tip (phase 5).</p><p id="P12">In control force spectroscopic measurements collected during indentation cycles performed on the background, force traces corresponding to wormlike chain pulling (WLC) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

These NPs exhibit a relatively broad size distribution having about 50 to 200 nm diameter. However, mostly, NPs having 50-80 nm diameters were observed, which may suggest a bimodal distribution. Many of the NPs have a solid core with an electron dense interior, distinct from the diffused aqueous background. This appearance may suggest a winding up of mRNA into "supercoils". Note that this interior is different from that in the anti-cancer nano-drug Doxil, where a low-density intra-liposome aqueous phase, similar to the background outside the liposome is surrounding the nano-rod-like doxorubicin-sulfate crystal inside the liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The cryo-TEM images of Comirnaty NPs highlight another phenomenon: the presence of electron-dense surface “caps” covering parts of the NPs (orange arrows), which resemble a bilayer coating, as in Doxil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that these thick semicircle lines are phospholipid bilayers, and that Comirnaty NPs are intermittently coated with phospholipid mono- and bi-layers, or there may be membrane-free surface areas possibly covered with polarized water. Additionally, cryo-TEM images of all samples also included particles having a bi-compartmental structure with a bilayer-coated bulge showing “grain-like” nanostructures attributable to the mRNA (blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A-C</xref>).

This dried and stained sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>) showed a wide variety of odd-shaped LNPs and some molecular details not seen with cryo-TEM were also observed. Higher magnification of some of the globular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>) shows circular and semicircular chains of ~2-3 nm dots lined up in yarn-ball-like lumps. These may be rationalized as mRNA “supercoils” held tightly together by intra- and interchain forces. Zooming into some structures (red arrows) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> we see intertwined helices winding out from NP remains, probably mRNA-containing fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>), and other structures seem to capture the process of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, blue arrows).</p><p id="P18">While the transitional structures could be artifacts in the dried and negatively stained LNPs, breakup and fusion of NPs were also seen in the 1-day stored AFM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), and the possibility of helical chains leaving the LNP was also suggested by the stepwise pulling out of string-like structures from Comirnaty by the AFM tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, these transient nanostructures were seen in samples stained with acidic uranyl acetate, and mRNA-LNPs are known to disintegrate in the acidic milieu of endosomes, the site of mRNA release into the cytosol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Thus, while exposing unforeseen details of LNP core structure, these transient NPs may illustrate the intra-endosomal transformation of LNPs after vaccination, in vivo.</p><p id="P19">Beyond the acidic milieu, the other likely contributing factor to LNP disintegration is the limited stability of the vaccine in water, as reflected in the brief (up to 6h) shelf-life of Comirnaty on RT after dilution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Comparing the trans-membrane pH gradient of Comirnaty and Doxil</title><p id="P20">Transmembrane ion and pH gradients are measures of NP membrane ability to maintain intra-liposome ion (including proton) concentration.

These facts highlight the need to better understand the molecular structure of mRNA-LNPs and, accordingly, better visualize them in schematic model.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Proposal of a new mRNA vaccine specific LNP model</title><p id="P27">According to Buschmann et al., each Comirnaty LNP contains up to 10 mRNA molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Considering the above-mentioned size of Comirnaty mRNA, they cannot fit into 60-150 nm diameter spheres unless they tightly wind up in dense loops or supercoils, just as the DNA fills the nuclei. There exist such vaccine presentations in the public media, showing the mRNA in the vaccine LNPs as balls of yarn, or thread balls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K, L</xref>), but these simplified, fictional models make no attempt to illustrate the details of the membranes and the relationships among the different internal components, most critically the IPC lipids, whose number exceeds that of the mRNA nucleotides 6-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup></p><p id="P28">The analytic and visual data in the present study, taken together with the mentioned size information suggest a new model wherein a single, or multiple copies of mRNA-IPC complexes densely fill up part, or the whole internal space of LNPs, and the IPC lipids, or self-associated IPC clusters, stabilize the tertiary structure of mRNA supercoils via intra- and interloop crosslinks and bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

However, both the hydrogen bonds, which are considered as weak bonds, and the electrostatic bonds, whatever still exists at neutral pH, become weaker as the temperature increases, as occurs during storage of the aqueous dispersion on RT, and even faster, when the mRNA-LNP reaches the temperature of body fluids (37°C).</p><p id="P30">The above weakly stabilized lipoplex model of Comirnaty mRNA-LNP was inspired by a recent study by Rissanou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> showing that an IPC lipid (called DML, details are seen in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), which is very similar to Comirnaty's IPC (ALC 0315) in terms of molecular size and steric positions of free OH- and O= groups, which can theoretically align with similar groups on the purine and pyrimidine bases of single stranded mRNA (red circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P31">For DML, evidence was provided that it can self-associate into clusters that can bind to mRNA both by ionic and hydrogen bonds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and thus stabilize the tertiary structure of the complex in an unprecedented molecular assembly where the mRNA meanders around lipid clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E and F</xref>). We hypothesize that ALC 0315 in Comirnaty may have similar mRNA binding capability and stabilize Comirnaty's mRNA in the delineated supercoil conformation, in a kind of glomerular lattice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Outlook</title><p id="P32">This study provided evidence that the NPs in Comirnaty are not conventional bilayer-coated liposomes, nor are identical to siRNA-carrying LNPs, but represent a unique molecular assembly whose structure can most easily be imagined as mRNA supercoils stabilized by pH and temperature-dependent weak inter- and intramolecular interactions, involving hydrogen and, possibly, ionic bonds. These NPs are “softer” than the standard bilayer liposomes or other LNPs with fuller membrane coverage, which may explain the diluted vaccine's limited stability on ambient temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup></p><p id="P33">Despite its softness, and, hence, limited stability, the vaccine is clearly very effective in inducing an immune response, raising the possibility that the above newly recognized structural features are contributing to, or may be essential for its immunogenic function. Our data may therefore lay the grounds for a paradigm shift in understanding the structure-function relationship in mRNA vaccines, as well as contribute to developing better imaging of LNP core structure.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p id="P34">BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) was from Pfizer/BioNtech, the vaccine used for human vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Further experiments were done with samples (a) stored at 4°C for one day or (b) frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, stored at -20°C for one day and thawed to room temperature. Round coverslips (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) were glued with UV epoxy onto metal AFM specimen disks, and cleaned with ethanol, then methanol.

During force spectroscopy, the cantilever was moved vertically with a speed of 1 μm/s from a height of 500 nm towards the vesicle vertex until a force threshold of 5 nN was reached. Then the tip was immediately retracted with the same speed. Deflection of the cantilever, hence force as a function of cantilever position (force-indentation curve or force curve), was recorded during the process.

In addition to the PDI, a standard measure of homogeneity, we also determined the SPAN, a better measure of distribution broadness than PDI.
