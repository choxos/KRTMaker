Whether this recurrent remodeling influences a specific organ’s aging trajectory is unknown. To address this, we systematically characterized at single-cell resolution the morphological and transcriptional changes that occur in ovary, oviduct, uterus, cervix, and vagina at each phase of the mouse estrus cycle, during decidualization, and into aging. Transcriptional and cell-to-cell communication networks in estrus cycle and aging are enriched for ECM reorganization and inflammation, two essential components of FRT remodeling. We directly link the organ-specific level of these two processes over reproductive lifespan with the gradual, age-related development of fibrosis and chronic inflammation. Our data represent a comprehensive atlas of the FRT lifespan, revealing pathological consequences of incomplete resolution of recurrent inflammation and tissue repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During the estrus cycle the mammalian female reproductive tract (FRT) undergoes extensive remodeling in preparation for ovulation and pregnancy. The physiological changes to the FRT, which occur in response to ovarian steroid hormones, are conserved between humans and other mammals, with the exception of the human-specific spontaneous terminal differentiation of the endometrial stromal cells in the process of decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bellofiore et al., 2018</xref>). These decidualized stromal cells are subsequently expelled during human menstruation. In most other mammals this final step of differentiation can be modeled by pregnancy induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Miller and Takahashi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Rajkovic et al., 2004</xref>). The reproductive cycle influences important functions of other organ systems, including shaping the immune response to infection and neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fernández et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gallichan and Rosenthal, 1996</xref>), yet remains poorly characterized. Prior analyses of mammalian estrus cycle have had a number of limitations: they were often microscopy-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Garry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hickey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Jurgensen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Sato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Schulke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Wang et al., 2000</xref>), analyzed single organs of the FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jemt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Roberson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Saare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), assayed the activity of few genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cornet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Von Wolff et al., 1999</xref>), used bulk tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), and/or have been primarily qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Igarashi et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Although the FRT organs are regulated systemically by sex hormones, they vary extensively in their susceptibility to age-related pathologies. Development of chronic degenerative diseases during aging is triggered by numerous changes in the cell microenvironment and cell-to-cell interactions. Systemic inflammation, known as inflammaging, significantly contributes to age-related morbidities. Inflammation is often accompanied by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in fibrosis. Progressive development of fibrosis with aging can lead to organ function impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Horowitz and Thannickal, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In mammals, many conserved reproductive processes, including ovulation in the ovary, menstruation and decidualization/implantation in the uterus, and the remodeling of the vaginal epithelium throughout the estrus cycle, display hallmark signs of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jabbour et al., 2009</xref>) and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Salamonsen et al., 2002</xref>). The female reproductive tract can resolve these cyclical inflammatory events rapidly and thus re-establish normal reproductive function. Multiple cell types cooperate to fine-tune the complex process of inflammation, with immune cells and fibroblasts playing major roles. Immune cells recognize and eliminate inflammatory triggers, while fibroblasts reorganize the microenvironment through expression of inflammatory cytokines, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and remodeling enzymes. When inflammation is not normally resolved, because of aging or other factors, chronic inflammation and fibrosis can develop. Fibroblasts likely shape inflammation persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>) by failing to return to a homeostatic state, thereby contributing to inflammatory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kirk et al., 2021</xref>). As the main ECM producers, they play key roles in tissue remodeling. Excessive and/or frequent tissue remodeling as a consequence of reoccurring injury can lead to fibrosis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Rockey et al., 2015</xref>), but current models assume that the FRT cyclical remodeling is scar-free.</p><p id="P5">To systematically explore the female reproductive cycle, we characterized at single-cell resolution the morphological and transcriptional changes that occur in ovary, oviduct, uterus, cervix, and vagina at each phase of the mouse estrus cycle, during decidualization, and into old age. Specifically to enable inter-organ comparisons at the same cycle stages, all five FRT organs were simultaneously collected and analyzed from over 20 individual mice. Our analyses newly reveal how the physiological differences between the upper (ovary, oviduct, uterus) and lower reproductive tract (cervix, vagina) are closely mirrored by compositional and transcriptional differences. To explore whether the cyclic inflammation and remodeling that naturally occur during the reproductive lifespan of young mice result in age-related chronic inflammation and fibrosis, we extensively characterized the inflammatory status of fibroblasts and their cell-to-cell communication networks during normal cycling and aging. We determined that transcription factor and cell-to-cell communication networks active in fibroblasts during estrus cycling and aging are enriched for ECM remodeling and inflammation, and are conserved between humans and mouse uteruses. Our analysis reveals that re-occurring cyclic changes in inflammation and ECM activity in each reproductive cycle significantly contribute to FRT aging linking the number of elapsed cycles with the age-related accumulation of fibrosis and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Single-cell characterization of the cycling female reproductive tract</title><p id="P6">We profiled how the female reproductive tract is remodeled during the estrus cycle, decidualization, and aging using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We characterized the cellular composition and transcriptional states present in ovary, oviduct, uterus, cervix, and vagina (with spleen as a control organ) by collecting 378,516 single-cell transcriptomes from normally cycling young mice in each of the four cycle phases (P - proestrus, E - estrus, M - metestrus and D - diestrus), as well as 30,966 cells from early pregnancy and 74,129 cells from acyclic old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-b</xref>, Table S1). All experiments were performed in three to seven biological replicates to allow for the assessment of statistical significance in all comparisons.</p><p id="P7">We analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes from all cycle phases and organs (76,600 cells per organ on average) in young cycling mice to identify cell types and their organ-specificity. To ensure the accuracy of the cell type annotation, we combined two automated approaches with an extensive manual comparison of marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>). These approaches identified approximately fifty cell types, including all expected stromal, epithelial and immune-cell sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>, Table S2). Cell types were defined independently in each organ and all organs were subsequently integrated together for visualization purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">By evaluating the cellular composition of all five FRT organs simultaneously, we identified a collection of cell types shared across the entire FRT, and quantified the extent to which the FRT shows a pronounced shift in its cellular composition between the upper and lower tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c</xref>). The cell types shared across the FRT include stromal fibroblasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, mural cells, a number of T cell subtypes, and endothelial cells, among others.</p><p id="P9">As expected, substantial variation in cellular composition occurs among the FRT organs. For instance, stromal cells outnumber epithelial cells in the upper FRT, whereas epithelial cells are more numerous in the lower reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c,d</xref>). The composition of the immune compartment also profoundly shifts between the upper and lower tracts. The upper tract is characterized by an enrichment of adaptive immune cells, including mucosa-associated T cells, memory T cells, and Natural Killer cells. The lower reproductive tract is dominated by the innate immune system, with a higher proportion of dendritic cells and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c</xref>). In addition, the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages profoundly changes between organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c</xref>). In the uterus and oviduct, wound-healing associated M2 macrophages dominate the cellular landscape, where they are likely involved in hormonally induced tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Madsen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the classically activated and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages dominate the ovary, consistent with previous reports that M1 but not M2 macrophages are required for folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Ono et al., 2018</xref>). M1 macrophages are also prevalent in cervix and vagina, consistent with these organs’ higher exposure to pathogens. Natural killer cells are concentrated in the uterus (and to a small extent in the oviduct), where they have been suggested to regulate decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Sojka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Our analyses identified major cell types present across the entire FRT, including stromal fibroblasts and macrophages; and revealed an anti- vs pro-inflammatory transition between the upper and the lower reproductive tract.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Estrus cycling dramatically remodels the cervix and vagina immune compartments</title><p id="P11">To understand how tissue-environment, hormone state, and intrinsic cell identity combine to shape each organ’s tissue landscape, we compared how the cellular composition of the entire female reproductive tract varies across the cycle in young female mice. We precisely staged the cycle by the emergence of specific cell types in vaginal smears (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>). The correct identification of the phases was confirmed by an unbiased reconstruction of a transcriptional pseudo-time trajectory of uterine fibroblasts, which ordered the mice according to the smear-assigned phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3b</xref>). Indeed, the substantial changes observed in vagina by single-cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) are consistent with the vaginal smears used to stage each mouse’s cycle. For example, the proportion of nucleated epithelial cells (such as BEpC and IEpcC) is at its highest in proestrus and lowest at metestrus (statistically significant by compositional regression, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>, Table S3). We also observed other expected features, including a large expansion of the stroma from proestrus to estrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Jin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Wood et al., 2007</xref>) and an expansion of glandular cells at proestrus in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Sato et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We analyzed the cellular population dynamics from both an organ-specific and cell type specific point of view. To quantify the magnitude of remodeling in each organ, we determined the fraction of each cell type at each phase of the cycle and plotted the cycle inter-quartile range. This comparative approach revealed that vagina has the most cycle-variable cell types, as well as the highest average amplitude of compositional changes in the FRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). The variability in cell composition across the cycle tends to decrease along the FRT: in uterus and cervix fewer cell types vary across the cycle, while oviduct and ovary are relatively invariant in their composition.</p><p id="P13">We then asked how the immune compartment of the female reproductive tract is remodeled across the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4a</xref>). We found that the fraction of immune cells is lowest during proestrus in all organs, and is also low during diestrus in the upper reproductive tract. The vagina and cervix show considerably greater variation in their content of immune cells, with a maximum at metestrus. For vagina, we independently confirmed the sharp peak in immune cell numbers in metestrus by quantifying the fraction of immune cells across the cycle via flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4b</xref>). In the uterus, in contrast, the immune-cell proportion peaks earlier at estrus, followed by a slower decline back to the minimum at proestrus. Interestingly, the immune fraction of the ovary and oviduct remains relatively invariant. Within specific immune cell populations, immune cells in the oviduct transition from M1 during estrus to M2 during metestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3c</xref>). In the uterus, M1 and M2 abundance also peaks during estrus, whereas metestrus is characterized by a specific abundance of NK cells.</p><p id="P14">Our analyses newly quantified how the different organs of the FRT are immunologically distinct. The lower reproductive tract undergoes cyclical, acute immune influx, which is also seen to a smaller but significant extent in the uterus and oviduct, while the ovary maintains an invariant population of immune cells throughout the cycle. Our characterization of the cycle dynamics of cellular abundance can be explored in an interactive online tool (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S40">Data Availability</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Uterus undergoes profound cyclical epithelial/stromal re-modeling</title><p id="P15">Cell proliferation and death can be regulated by systemic steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Wood et al., 2007</xref>). Leveraging on our simultaneous profiling of the five organs of the FRT, we asked whether tissue proliferation/remodeling is synchronized between them. To determine if the relative abundances of stroma and epithelia are coordinated across organs and across the cycle we calculated the ratio of epithelium to stroma across the FRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4c</xref>). In all FRT organs, this ratio is lowest during diestrus and increases on the transition to proestrus; this coincides with the known progesterone minimum at diestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>). With the exception of uterus, FRT organs are relatively stable in the transition from proestrus to estrus and peak at metestrus. In uterus, proestrus profoundly changes the ratio of epithelia to stroma, and therefore we asked if proliferation contributes to these dynamic changes. We derived proliferation scores using the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>), which revealed that proliferation rates of epithelia are highest during the estrogen (E2) surge at proestrus and lowest at metestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). In contrast, stromal proliferation peaks at estrus and metestrus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4d</xref>), coinciding with peak progesterone (P4) levels, which promotes stromal proliferation and inhibition of the E2-induced epithelial proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The most notable contrast in tissue remodeling is between vagina and uterus, providing a high-resolution quantification for the current models obtained from histopathological analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Sato et al., 1997</xref>). In vagina, there are cell type specific changes within the epithelial compartment across the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>) which do not impact the overall balance of epithelia to stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). In contrast, the uterus shows strong changes in its epithelial to stromal ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In sum, our data reveals how proliferation and immune activation are precisely regulated during the cycle. The regulation of cell type abundances and immune infiltration in the FRT is highly organ specific, despite their equal exposure to circulating hormones.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Tissue morphological changes are tracked by gene expression</title><p id="P18">We considered the possibility that organs such as ovary and oviduct, where cell abundances are relatively stable across the cycle, might instead show substantial changes in transcription. We scored the magnitude of transcriptional change between phases of the cycle for each cell type in every FRT organ using optimal transport analysis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). This analysis revealed that cycle–related variation in cell type abundance is accompanied by a corresponding scale of transcriptional change. Vagina and cervix are high in both cell type variability and gene expression; in contrast, the cells in uterus, oviduct, and ovary show less of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,h</xref>). When considered by cell types, we observed the same effect: the abundance of immune cells closely corresponds to their functional activation, which we orthogonally measured by single-cell scoring of inflammation markers and cytokine gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>, Table S9), in agreement with total cytokine and chemokine concentration found in vaginal and uterine lavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hickey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Sonoda, Y. et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Our data show that organs with the largest morphological changes also have the largest transcriptional changes across all cell types, suggesting a positive feedback loop interaction between morphological and transcriptional change.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fibroblast functions are dynamically regulated throughout the cycle, but not coordinated between organs</title><p id="P20">Fibroblasts are key regulators of wound healing and inflammation in multiple organs, we therefore asked if fibroblasts play the same functional roles in the cycling FRT organs, and whether these roles are coordinated between them. We first used over-representation analysis (ORA) to identify the functional pathways enriched among cycling genes with significant differential expression between any two adjacent phases of the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, Table S7, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>). This revealed that ECM remodeling and Tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) regulation of inflammation are core programmes of fibroblasts during the cycle. However, the activity of these two specific functional pathways is often out of phase or even anti-correlated between organs, despite equal exposure of the organs to circulating hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The activation of inflammatory pathways in fibroblasts shows two organ-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, Table S9, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>): in vagina, cervix, and oviduct, inflammatory activity peaks at metestrus, and in uterus and ovary at proestrus. Thus, the vaginal immune cell infiltration we previously observed at metestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) is accompanied by fibroblast inflammatory activation. In contrast, ECM organization shows no coordinated pattern across FRT organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Compared to the other organs, uterus has the most extensive ECM remodeling which peaks at proestrus and reaches its minimum during estrus.</p><p id="P22">Our data confirms that cycling fibroblast programmes are similar between organs, yet often out of phase, suggesting that fibroblast functions are regulated by a combination of systemic and local cues.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cell-to-cell communication and transcription factor activity reveal high inflammation in the lower FRT and extensive ECM remodeling in the uterus</title><p id="P23">Fibroblasts coordinate organ function and homeostasis via communication with other cell types through ligand– receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">DeLeon-Pennell et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore performed cell-to-cell communication analysis to identify the organ-specificity and activity of ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). We first focused on how ligands from all cell types converged on fibroblasts, by calculating communication scores as the product between a and b, where a is the expression of ligands averaged over all cell types in all phases (the ‘ambient’ ligand expression), and b is the expression of receptors averaged over fibroblasts in all phases.</p><p id="P24">Vaginal and cervical fibroblasts have the highest communication scores for pro-inflammatory Interleukin 1 beta (<italic>Il1b</italic>) and <italic>Tnf</italic>; and the lowest scores for anti-inflammatory Interleukin 10 (<italic>Il10</italic>), Interleukin 11 (<italic>Il11</italic>) and Transforming growth factor beta (<italic>Tgfb</italic>) cell-to-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a</xref>, Table S4, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>). In contrast, uterine fibroblasts receive primarily anti-inflammatory signaling, and oviduct and ovary have a mixture of anti- and pro-inflammatory signaling.
