Data on livestock movements can therefore be harnessed to guide policy on targeted interventions for controlling infectious livestock diseases, including Rift Valley fever (RVF) — a vaccine-preventable arboviral fever. While detailed livestock movement data are available in many countries, such data are generally lacking in others, including many in East Africa, where multiple RVF outbreaks have been reported in recent years. Available movement data are imperfect, and the impact of imperfect movement data on targeted vaccination is not fully understood. Here, we used a network simulation model to describe the spread of RVF within and between 398 wards in northern Tanzania connected by cattle movements, on which we evaluated the impact of targeting vaccination using imperfect movement data. We show that pre-emptive vaccination guided by only market movement permit data could prevent large outbreaks. Targeted control (either by the risk of RVF introduction or onward transmission) at any level of imperfect movement information is preferred over random vaccination, and any improvement in information reliability is advantageous to their effectiveness. Our modelling approach demonstrates how targeted interventions can be carefully applied to inform animal and public health policies on disease control planning in settings where detailed data on livestock movements are unavailable or imperfect due to a lack of data-gathering resources.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tanzania</kwd><kwd>livestock networks</kwd><kwd>network measures</kwd><kwd>metapopulation model</kwd><kwd>Rift Valley fever</kwd><kwd>targeted vaccination</kwd><kwd>imperfect information</kwd><kwd>robustness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Infectious diseases are an important challenge facing livestock production systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) particularly in developing countries, due to their substantial impact on livestock health and welfare, and in terms of economic losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Worldwide, infectious diseases of animals that affect humans (zoonoses) are responsible for over 2.5 billion cases of illnesses in humans, with an estimated 2.7 million deaths every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Due to the impacts of many factors — including climate change, urbanisation, globalisation, changing eating habits, deforestation, and human-wildlife interaction — human and animal populations are at high and increasing risk of zoonotic disease transmission, emergence, and re-emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Infectious diseases, including zoonoses, can spread within and between livestock populations by various routes, including direct contact, via vectors such as mosquitoes, consumption of contaminated animal products, and livestock movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Livestock movements, for trading and grazing, play a significant role in disease spread between populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). For instance, the 2001 foot-and-mouth (FMD) outbreak in the UK was primarily driven by long-distance movements of livestock between holdings and local transmission within holdings at the early stage of the epidemic before a movement ban was implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Vaccination is an effective measure for controlling infectious disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, to design an efficient vaccination strategy for infectious disease control, it is crucial to understand the behaviour of disease transmission within and between populations. Decisions about where to impose a disease control strategy rely on a range of factors, including the specific pathogen, the outbreak type (whether it is a common source or propagated outbreak), the size of the target population, the contact network connecting the population, the resources available, and the effectiveness of the control strategy. Network-based modelling is a way of describing the interplay between infectious disease transmission and the contact network pattern, as well as providing a means of testing the impact of interventions in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Targeted vaccination strategies that exploit the hierarchy of nodes’ connectivity in a network are highly effective when the complete structure of the network is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, our knowledge of the network structure of populations is usually imperfect due to incomplete or unreliable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In reality, network studies rely on observed networks that differ from the true network connecting the population under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Such error can substantially impact network measures, which might considerably affect their performance in epidemic control on the true network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), therefore motivating analyses to understand how different network measures are impacted by imperfect information.</p><p id="P5">Tanzania is one of the countries in East Africa where infectious diseases, including zoonoses, pose a challenge to livestock and human health and welfare. Several efforts have been made to reduce the burden of dangerous zoonotic diseases, including rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF), and brucellosis in Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). For example, in 2010, the Tanzanian government launched a nationwide vaccination campaign against rabies, following many other countries aiming to meet the global target for eliminating human deaths caused by rabies by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). As resources are often limited in low-income countries such as Tanzania, insights from modelling analyses can help guide such vaccination campaigns to yield the greatest impact on disease outbreaks.</p><p id="P6">Livestock are typically managed in distinct units, which in Tanzania comprise herds and flocks that are kept in households or multi-family compounds within villages. Livestock units are linked by movements, many of which go through markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), forming a complex network of nodes (representing populations of livestock) and links (representing livestock movements between populations). Such networks can be modelled using a meta-population framework, which allows us to test the impact of targeted vaccination strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Many researchers have investigated the impact of network-based vaccination strategies on epidemic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Many of those studies are either based on theoretical (model) networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) or real-world networks generated from developed countries, where livestock movement data are rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). So far, however, few studies have used network structure in African livestock setting to study vaccination strategies for infectious disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we investigate the effectiveness and robustness of various vaccination strategies under imperfect knowledge of network structure. To do this, we simulated the spread of RVF virus using a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model on both theoretical networks (generated by simple network models, including random, scale-free and small-world) and a network of livestock movements across three regions in northern Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), upon which we tested the impact of simulated targeted vaccination. Theoretical networks were included to test the robustness of our conclusions to network structure. We focused on RVF as an exemplar because it is an important vaccine-preventable livestock infection where we can build on previous studies of the role of livestock movements in the spread of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The aims of this study were: first, to model the effectiveness of epidemic control using network-informed vaccination strategies; and second, to investigate how their performance varies under imperfect knowledge of the network.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><label>2</label><title>Methods And Materials</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Overview</title><p id="P8">This <italic>in silico</italic> study followed five basic steps: 1) generate a cattle movement network; 2) simulate the condition of imperfect information about the network; 3) use different network-targeted strategies to select nodes for vaccination under imperfect network information; 4) simulate multiple scenarios of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus transmission over the network with selected vaccinated nodes; and 5) compare mean outbreak size after one year under various vaccination strategies and levels of imperfect network information. We begin this section by describing the study area and how cattle movement networks were generated, followed by a description of the network-based vaccination targeting strategies (using degree, betweenness, and PageRank centrality measures) and risk-based strategies (the risk of RVF introduction into the cattle population, derived from an index for indicating rainfall) that were considered in this study.

Livestock production in these regions is predominantly carried out for food, income, and social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). A detailed description of the study area and its livestock practices is given in de Glanville et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). There are various complex socio-economic reasons for livestock movement in northern Tanzania, including access to natural resources such as grazing, water, and salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), exchange of livestock as gifts and payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), and trade movements through the market system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Network generation</title><p id="P10">This study exploits the multiplex network of cattle movements in northern Tanzania generated by Chaters et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The multiplex (which we shall refer to here as the “data-driven” network, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) contains two layers: a movement network of cattle through markets and a network connecting adjacent wards. In the first layer, Chaters et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) market movement permit data were used to generate a static network of cattle movements between 398 wards within three regions (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara) in northern Tanzania, where the number of cattle moved is based on the estimates of the number moved in a month. A <italic>ward</italic> is an administrative unit of a mean area 243 km<sup>2</sup> containing a mean human population of 12 000 and a mean cattle population of 9 000 across all 398 wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The market permit data were collected as part of the SEEDZ (Social, Economic and Environmental Drivers of Zoonoses in Tanzania) project, the protocols and procedures of which were approved by the ethics review committees of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC/832) and National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR/2028) in Tanzania, and in the UK by the ethics review committee of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences at the University of Glasgow (39a/15). Approval for study activities was also provided by the Tanzanian Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) and by the Tanzanian Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, as well as by regional, district, ward and village-level authorities in the study area.</p><p id="P11">The cattle movement network data were aggregated spatially at the ward level because the destinations recorded on the movement permits could not typically be located at a finer scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). A spatial network, created by connecting each ward to all its spatially adjacent wards, was added to the market movement network, as a means of accounting for contacts that occur between wards through sharing of grazing and water sources, and movements of animals through gifting and private sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We used the combined monthly market movement networks to generate a static directed weighted network over a year, which was then used to calculate network measures. The spatial network was excluded from the calculation of network measures because we expect targeting strategies would be guided by market network data in real policy situations.</p><p id="P12">We generated unweighted theoretical networks with an equal number of nodes (398) and mean degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) as the monthly “unweighted mean market movement” network to explore the effect of varying network structures on results. These included Erdős-Rényi (ER) random networks, scale-free networks, and small-world networks. Only the information on whether there was a market movement of cattle between wards in the data-driven network was used to generate the unweighted mean market network.</p><p id="P13">For random networks, we use the Erdős and Rényi <italic>G</italic>(<italic>N, M</italic>) model with <italic>N</italic> = 398 nodes and <italic>M</italic> = 2×398 links, resulting in random networks with mean degree 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To generate small-world networks, we followed the model proposed by Watts and Strogatz. First, arrange nodes (wards) in a 1-dimensional circular lattice (a ring) such that each node is connected to two nearest neighbours on either side.

The giant strongly connected component (GSCC) size of networks created by this algorithm is generally 1. To obtain networks with a larger GSCC size, we reshuffled the network’s links while preserving the degree distribution. The summary statistics of networks generated are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

In contrast, cattle movements in the theoretical networks were based on the mean number of animals moved through market. In each simulation scenario, we select a proportion of nodes for vaccination based on the strategy of interest. Since we are only interested in successful epidemics, we seeded infection in five wards based on disease introduction risk (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and with 10 infected cattle in each of those wards, to reduce the probability of stochastic extinction, as less intensive seeding resulted in many failed simulations. For each ward selected for disease introduction, seeded cases were uniformly distributed between grids of the ward, and the epidemic was allowed to spread locally and through cattle movements within and between wards, respectively. The numbers of animals in each state were updated at daily time steps. All simulations were implemented using the SimInf package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>) within the R statistical software environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.7</label><title>Vaccination strategies</title><p id="P23">To explore the impact of vaccination on RVF virus transmission dynamics, a proportion of nodes (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) were selected for pre-emptive vaccination (i.e. in anticipation of a higher risk of disease outbreaks), at 75% within-node coverage (the proportion of cattle to be vaccinated in each ward to achieve herd immunity, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></inline-formula>).

Here, we considered four vaccination strategies. These included three network-based strategies, where nodes with high degree, betweenness, or PageRank centrality rank are targeted for vaccination, and a risk-based strategy motivated by habitat suitability for disease occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The aim of comparing network-based against risk-based strategies was to understand whether the risk of introduction of disease is a better determinant of outbreak size than the risks associated with propagation across the network. We also considered random vaccination and a no-vaccination scenario to establish two baseline measures for comparison to targeted vaccination scenarios.</p><p id="P25">The effectiveness of vaccination strategies under perfect information was measured in terms of percentage reduction in the mean number of wards with at least one infected bovid (MNWIC) under each vaccination scenario relative to the MNWIC under the no-vaccination scenario across all 400 simulations.

In this study, we used a meta-population model to simulate the spread of RVF virus on livestock movement networks, examined the impact of network-based and risk-based vaccination strategies, and explored how imperfect information affects their effectiveness. This research addressed the common real-life problems in veterinary research — incomplete and patchy data about livestock movement patterns — arising from Tanzania and many other countries.</p><p id="P35">The major finding of this investigation is that the loss of effectiveness of targeted vaccination strategies with increasing data imperfection is approximately linear regardless of network structure. Essentially, any improvement in information reliability is beneficial.</p><p id="P36">Additional results showed no universally optimal targeting strategy across all network structures and proportions of vaccinated nodes. Nevertheless, vaccination by betweenness and degree are generally the most effective network-based strategies. This observation is robust to very different network structures and corroborates the results of other research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Hébert-Dufresne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) used SIR and SIS models to compare the effectiveness of targeted immunisation strategies (degree, betweenness, community membership) on 17 networks, including World Wide Web, US power Grids and Co-authorship networks (MathSci and arXiv). Similarly, Eames et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>) studied the impact of preventive vaccination on a weighted contact network using a SIR model. Keeling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) compared pre-emptive vaccination with a combination of reactive vaccination and culling during an ongoing epidemic using a stochastic farm-based simulation model of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. They found that vaccinating high-risk farms (based on the largest cattle farms) before an epidemic efficiently reduces the potential for a major outbreak. In our data-driven network, the effectiveness of betweenness and degree were similar when the proportion of vaccinated nodes was lower than 30%. Above 30%, degree vaccination dominates over betweenness. In this case, the choice of vaccination strategy depends on the resources available. Even though the data-driven network is fully connected with GSCC of 398, the outbreak size was smaller than that of the small-world with GSCC of 388 network. A possible explanation for this circumstance might be because up to 34% of the link weights in the data-driven network are significantly less than 1, representing lower onward transmission risk through those links.</p><p id="P37">Under perfect information, we noted a crossover point between the effectiveness of network-based (degree and betweenness) and risk-based vaccination in the data-driven network. For example, when a small proportion of wards are vaccinated (&lt; 30%), both degree and betweenness vaccination work better than risk vaccination. However, when the proportion of vaccinated wards is higher, risk vaccination outperformed all network-based vaccination. This evidence suggests that if our knowledge of network information were perfect, there might be scenarios where vaccinating the points of RVF virus introduction into the system is preferred over vaccinating the points of onward transmission. In scenarios where we can only cover 20% of wards, our findings show there is a noise level at which the effectiveness of degree is no different from the effectiveness of risk vaccination. Again, this observation suggests that if our knowledge of network information is imperfect, depending on how well we know the highly central and high-risk wards, we might choose one strategy over the other when we can only vaccinate a few wards. Because this result is not robust to changing network structures, we are unable to extrapolate it to all networks, so it must be interpreted with caution. For instance, in theoretical networks, all targeting strategies are perfectly linear with increasing noise and there is no crossover.</p><p id="P38">There are some potential limitations of this study. First, the network used in this study is generated based on the outcome of Chaters et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and it is not an exact representation of the Tanzanian cattle movement system. Secondly, the number of nodes used to generate theoretical networks was kept very small to mimic the data-driven system, which might affect our ability to generalise results. Thirdly, we did not evaluate the impact of the bias and error associated with noise in the risk of RVF, as expressed through NDVI. Whilst NDVI can be accurately measured, its correlation with the emergence of RVF is not fully known and thus our strategy of targetting introduction into the highest NDVI wards may have relevant inaccuracies.</p><p id="P39">Lastly, our model did not consider mosquito-vector dynamics. This decision was due to insufficient data about the abundance and activities of specific mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes</italic> species) capable of transmitting the RVF virus. It is evident that mosquitoes contribute to keeping the RVF virus within the enzootic cycle by transmitting the virus from host to host, leading to the persistence of RVF. Our model can be extended to explicitly include mosquito population dynamics and multiple hosts where data are available. We recommend future studies on this topic, with additional complexities such as a detailed RVF virus transmission model, livestock movement system at a finer scale (e.g., village-level), and various intervention strategies (e.g., movement bans).</p><p id="P40">In conclusion, our study provides a framework to examine the hypothesis that the well-studied targeted strategies, which are highly effective under perfect information, might be ineffective under imperfect information. We hope this work will contribute to a new or existing framework for carefully designing and planning network-driven intervention strategies for infectious livestock disease control, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where missing livestock movement data severely limits opportunities for network-targeted interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS161330-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d31aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Divine Ekwem for his helpful discussion and input.</p><sec id="S17"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), the Economic &amp; Social Research Council (ESRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory, under the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems (ZELS) programme (BB/L018926/1).
