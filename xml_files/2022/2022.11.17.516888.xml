including BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. The subvariants BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 are expected to become predominant in many countries in November 2022. They carry an additional and often redundant set of mutations in the spike, likely responsible for increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Here, we established a viral amplification procedure to easily isolate Omicron strains. We examined their sensitivity to 6 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to 72 sera from Pfizer BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals, with or without BA.1/BA.2 or BA.5 breakthrough infection. Ronapreve (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) and Evusheld (Cilgavimab and Tixagevimab) lost any antiviral efficacy against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1, whereas Xevudy (Sotrovimab) remained weakly active. BQ.1.1 was also resistant to Bebtelovimab. Neutralizing titers in triply vaccinated individuals were low to undetectable against BQ.1.1 and BA.2.75.2, 4 months after boosting. A BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough infection increased these titers, which remained about 18-fold lower against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1, than against BA.1. Reciprocally, a BA.5 breakthrough infection increased more efficiently neutralization against BA.5 and BQ.1.1 than against BA.2.75.2. Thus, the evolution trajectory of novel Omicron subvariants facilitated their spread in immunized populations and raises concerns about the efficacy of most currently available mAbs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Successive sub-lineages of Omicron have spread worldwide since the identification of BA.1 in November 2021 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Probably more than 80% of the population were infected by one or another Omicron subvariant in less than one year <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, without efficient protection against infection conferred by vaccination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The incidence of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals has thus increased with Omicron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. All Omicron lineages exbibit considerable immune evasion properties. BA.1 and BA.2 contained about 32 changes in the spike protein, promoting immune escape and high transmissibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. BA.5 was then predominant in many countries by mid-2022 and was responsible for a novel peak of contaminations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. BA.4 and BA.5 bear the same spike, with 4 additional modifications when compared to BA.2. The neutralizing activity of sera from COVID-19 vaccine recipients was further reduced against BA.4/BA.5 by about 3-5 fold compared to BA.1 and BA.2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Novel sub-variants with enhanced transmissibility rates, derived from either BA.2 or BA.4/BA.5, rapidly emerged and should become prevalent in November 2022. Their geographical distribution is heterogeneous, but they carry an additional limited set of mutations in the spike. For instance, BA.2.75.2, derived from BA.2, was first noted in India and Singapore and comprises R346T, F486S and D1199N substitutions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. BA.4.6 was detected in various countries, including USA and UK, and carries R346T and N658S mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As of November 2022, BQ.1.1 became the main circulating lineage in many countries. It also carries the R346T mutation found in BA.2.75.2, along with K444T and N460K substitutions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The R346T mutation has been associated with escape from monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and from vaccine-induced antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. This convergent evolution of the spike suggests that the different circulating SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages faced a similar selective pressure, probably exerted by preexisting or imprinted immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. A characterization of these new viruses is needed to evaluate their potential impact.</p><p id="P4">A few recent articles and preprints reported an extensive escape of these Omicron subvariants to neutralization, studying sera from individuals who received three or four vaccine doses, including a bivalent booster <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Most of these studies were performed with lentiviral or VSV pseudotypes. In one preprint <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses carrying spikes from Omicron sublineages in an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 backbone were generated, but they might behave somewhat differently than authentic isolates.</p><p id="P5">Here, we identified and used a highly permissive cell line to amplify BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 isolates. We analyzed the sensitivity of these strains to approved mAbs, to sera from Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine recipients, and to individuals with BA.1/BA.2 or BA.5 breakthrough infections.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid isolation of Omicron subvariants with the IGROV-1 cell line</title><p id="P6">SARS-CoV-2 strains are classically isolated and amplified in Vero E6 or Vero-TMPRSS2+ cells. Vero cells are african green monkey kidney epithelial cells that were derived in the 1960s. They are defective in type-I interferon production and sensitive to many viral species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, upon serial passages in Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may acquire adaptive spike mutations, with modification or deletion of the furin-like cleavage site, resulting in phenotypic changes in plaque assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Omicron isolates are growing less efficiently in Vero E6 and Vero-TMPRSS2+ cells than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, probably because Omicron relies more on endocytic proteases and less on TMPRSS2 than other variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This may explain why infectious viral loads measured in nasopharyngeal swabs from Omicron-infected individuals appeared lower than those infected with Delta, despite an enhanced transmissibility of Omicron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We thus sought another cell line that may be more adapted to isolation and replication of Omicron subvariants than Vero cells. To this aim, we screened a panel of cells and observed that IGROV-1 cells were highly permissive to Omicron. IGROV-1 cells originated from an ovarian carcinoma and were established in 1985 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. IGROV-1 cells naturally express low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We compared the permissibility of Vero-TMPRSS2+ and IGROV-1 cells to Omicron and Delta. We titrated infectious viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs from 53 Delta and 81 Omicron (BA.1) infected individuals collected at the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (HEGP) in Paris. The characteristics of the patients (age, sex, days post onset of symptoms, vaccination status) appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Nasopharyngeal swabs were serially diluted and incubated with either Vero-TMPRSS2+ or IGROV-1 cells. After 48h, cells were stained with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 N monoclonal antibody. Foci of infected cells were scored with an automated confocal microscope. A representative experiment with Delta and Omicron positive samples demonstrated a high sensitivity of IGROV-1 to Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The 134 samples were ranked according to their viral RNA levels measured by RT-qPCR, from low to high Ct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). With Delta-positive samples, there was no major difference in infectious viral titers calculated with Vero-TMPRSS2+ or IGROV-1 cells which inversely correlated with Ct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). We did not detect infectious virus in samples with Ct&gt;27. About 35% of Delta positive samples carried infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d,e</xref>). The situation was different with Omicron BA.1 positive samples. We did not detect Omicron-infected Vero-TMPRSS2+ cells, even in samples with low Ct, at this early time-point (48h). In contrast, 52% of the samples from Omicron-infected individuals were positive when titrated on IGROV-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d,e</xref>), confirming that these cells are particularly sensitive to Omicron BA.1.</p><p id="P9">We next isolated BA.4.6 and BQ.1.1 variants from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at HEGP using IGROV-1 cells. As with BA.1, numerous foci of infected cells were detected at 2 days post-infection (p.i.) and supernatants were harvested at days 2 or 3 p.i., yelding high titers with the S-Fuse reporter cells. S-Fuse cells form syncytia and become GFP+ upon infection, allowing overnight measurement of viral infectivity and neutralizing antibody activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Sequences of the variants after one passage on IGROV-1 cells identified BA.4.6 and BQ.1.1 (Pango lineage B.1.1.529.4.6 and B.1.1.529.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1, respectively according to Nextstrain, GISAID accession ID: BA.4.6: EPI_ISL_15729633 and BQ.1.1: EPI_ISL_15731523), indicating that no adaptative mutations were generated during this short culture period. As expected, BA.4.6 included R346T and N658S mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and BQ.1.1 carried R346T, K444T and N460K substitutions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The spike mutations in the main Omicron subvariants are depicted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">We also isolated a BA.2.75.2 variant from a nasopharyngeal swab from the National Reference Center of UZ/KU Leuven (Belgium). The virus was initially amplified by two passages on Vero E6 cells, but the resulting viral titers were low. We thus performed one supplementary passage on IGROV-1 cells, which significantly increased the titers to 4x10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml in 48 hours. Sequencing of the virus confirmed the presence of BA.2.75.2 (Pango lineage B.1.1.529.2.75.2, according to Nextstrain, GISAID accession ID: E EPI_ISL_15731524). When compared to BA.2.75, the BA.2.75.2 spike protein contained 3 additional mutations, R346T and F486S in the RBD, and D1199N in the HR2 (Heptad Repeat 2) region, located in the S2 domain and involved in fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Syncytia were observed in BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1-infected S-Fuse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). The three variants generated syncytia of similar size, that were smaller than those formed by the ancestral D614G strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). It will be worth further examining whether other Omicron subvariants may display different fusogenic potential in different cell types.</p><p id="P12">Altogether, these results show that IGROV-1 cells are highly sensitive to Omicron. They allow a rapid titration of infectivity present in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected individuals, as well as a one-passage amplification of Omicron subvariants. Future work will help determining the underlying cellular mechanisms and whether entry or other steps of the viral cycle are facilitated in IGROV-1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neutralization of BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 by approved monoclonal antibodies</title><p id="P13">Several anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure therapy in individuals at risk for severe disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

Prophylaxis based on Ronapreve (Imdevimab + Casirivimab) or Evusheld (Cilgavimab + Tixagevimab) cocktails provided about 80% protection against symptomatic infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Post-infection treatment with Xevudy (Sotrovimab) reached 85% efficacy in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalization or death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 escaped neutralization from a large part of these mAbs, leading to changes in treatment guidelines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As of mid-2022, Ronapreve and Sotrovimab were no longer approved and a double dose of Evusheld was recommended. Bebtelovimab is another potent mAb, similarly effective against ancestral strains and BA.1 and BA.2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, currently only available in United States <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">We thus assessed with the S-Fuse assay the sensitivity of BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 to mAbs that are currently authorized (Cilgavimab, Tixagevimab and Bebtelovimab) or were withdrew because of Omicron escape (Sotrovimab, Casirivimab and Imdevimab). As controls, we included the ancestral D614G strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Cilgavimab and Tixagevimab, alone or in combination, as well as Casirivimab, lost any neutralization activity against the three Omicron variants. Imdevinab inhibited BA.4.6 (IC50 220 ng/ml) but was inactive against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1. Bebtelovimab was efficient against BA.4.6 and BA.2.75.2 (IC50 2.7 and 4.3 ng/ml, respectively) but did not neutralize BQ.1.1. Sotrovimab was the only mAb active, albeit weakly, against BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. With Sotrovimab, the IC50s ranged from 2,874 to 19,391 ng/ml, which represents a 45-to-300-fold increase compared to D641G.</p><p id="P15">These results demonstrate that the prevalent BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 strains are resistant or weakly sensitive to currently approved mAbs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cohort design</title><p id="P16">We collected 72 sera from a cohort of 35 health-care workers, in Orleans, France.

The characteristics of the participants are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. The participants, that were not previously infected at the time of inclusion, received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine within an interval of 21-28 days and a booster dose 164 to 314 days later. 30 out of 35 individuals experienced a pauci-symptomatic breakthrough Omicron infection 60 to 359 days after the third injection. Screening by PCR or whole viral genome sequencing identified the Omicron subvariant responsible for the breakthrough infection. A first group of 16 individuals was infected between December 2021 and mid-June 2022, a period when BA.1 and BA.2 were successively dominant in France <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

Eighteen individuals were analyzed early (1 month post third dose) and ten individuals at a later time-point (4 months post third dose). We measured the potency of their sera against BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. We used as controls the D614G ancestral strain (belonging to the basal B.1 lineage), as well as BA.1 and BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We calculated the ED50 (Effective Dose 50%) for each combination of serum and virus. One month after the booster dose, ED50 were high for D614G (ED50 of 5x10<sup>3</sup>) and were decreased by 8- and 15-fold for BA.1 (ED50 of 7x10<sup>2</sup>) and BA.5 (ED50 of 3x10<sup>2</sup>) respectively, confirming the antibody escape properties of these previous sublineages. With BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1, the ED50 were low and within the range of those observed with the parental BA.5 strain. BA.2.75.2 neutralization titers were even lower (11-fold lower than BA.1). A similar trend was observed at a later time-point.

Eighteen individuals were analyzed at 3 months. Among them, 11 individuals were resampled 8 months after infection to evaluate the evolution of the humoral response. After 3 months, a strong augmentation of neutralization against D614G and BA.1 was observed, with ED50 above 10<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Compared to BA.1, the Nab titers were reduced by about 7-fold against BA.5 and BA.4.6 (ED50 of 1.5x10<sup>3</sup> and 1.8x10<sup>3</sup>, respectively) and reduced by 18-fold against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (ED50 of 6x10<sup>2</sup> and 7x10<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Neutralizing titers differently declined depending on the viral isolate. Eight months after infection, titers remained high against D614G and BA.1 (ED50 of 8x10<sup>4</sup> and 3x10<sup>4</sup>, respectively). The decline was stronger against BA.5 and BA.4.6 (ED50 of 4x10<sup>2</sup>) and even more marked against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (ED50 of 2x10<sup>2</sup>). Therefore, post-vaccination infection by BA.1/BA.2 led to an increase in Omicron-specific neutralizing antibody titers, with disparities between variants. The anti-BA.1 response was higher than against BA.5 and BA.4.6, whereas BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 were less sensitive to neutralization.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Impact of BA.5 breakthrough infections on neutralization of Omicron subvariants</title><p id="P20">The distinct neutralization profile of BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 after BA.1/BA.2 infection led us to examine the consequences of a BA.5 breakthrough infection on neutralization.

We identify IGROV-1 cells as being highly permissive to Omicron, through reasons that remain to be determined. Omicron is less replicative and fusogenic than Delta in various human cell lines including Vero, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 and U2OS-derived S-Fuse cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the evolution of Omicron sublineages towards increased transmissibility is associated with greater fitness in human primary cells. BA.1 potently replicates in nasal epithelial cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. BA.4 and BA.5 replicate more efficiently than BA.2 in alveolar epithelial cells and are more fusogenic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.

We did not observe an enhanced cell-cell fusogenicity of BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 compared to BA.5, at least in S-Fuse cells, but it will be worth further examining viral fitness and fusion of these strains in IGROV-1 or primary cells.</p><p id="P23">Our results show that IGROV-1 cells recapitulate the permissibility of primary human nasal or alveolar cells to Omicron strains. Future work will help understanding viral entry pathways and replication in IGROV-1 cells. Whatever the underlying mechanisms, these cells proved useful to amplify BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 in a single passage, avoiding or minimizing the risk of selection of culture adaptative mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. IGROV-1 cells are also sensitive to previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. Combining viral isolation in IGROV-1 cells with the S-Fuse neutralization assay provides a rapid procedure to evaluate the properties of novel and forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</p><p id="P24">We demonstrate that the currently approved or recently withdrawn therapeutic mAbs lost most of their neutralization potential against these Omicron subvariants. Evusheld no longer neutralized BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. Bebtelovimab was active against BA.2.75.2 and BA.4.6. but not against BQ.1.1.

Ronapreve was active against BA.4.6 but not against the prevalent BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 isolates.

Sotrovimab also displays non-neutralizing antiviral activities, including ADCC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Sotrovimab remains clinically active against BA.2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

Overall, our results are in line with a recent preprint using lentiviral pseudotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and raise important concerns regarding the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of currently approved mAbs.

One month after a first booster, ED50 displayed a 10- to 80-fold decrease compared to the ancestral D614G strain. At 4 months post vaccination, neutralization was undetectable for BA.2.75.2 and slightly above background for BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. These results suggest an abbreviated efficacy of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine against the three variants, extending our previous results with BA.1 and BA.5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

In contrast, when using tests based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus carrying spikes from different Omicron sublineages, it was observed that bivalent mRNA booster may broaden humoral immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These discrepancies may be due to differences in experimental systems, the delay between booster administration and blood sampling and/or variation in immune imprinting across cohorts. Future work with authentic field isolates and well-characterized sera, combined with real-world vaccine efficacy data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, will help characterizing the interest of bivalent vaccines against Omicron subvariants.</p><p id="P26">We observed a dichotomy of the neutralizing response after BA.1/BA.2 or BA.5 breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals. In both cases, the Nabs were particularly high against D614G, highlighting the role of immune imprinting in anamnestic responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, after BA.1/BA.2 infection, sera also potently neutralized BA.1 but there was a 6 to 18-fold reduction in efficacy against BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1. Conversely, after BA.5 breakthrough infection, titers were higher against BA.5-derived variants than against BA.1 or BA.2.75.2. It has been reported that vaccinated individuals infected during the first Omicron wave showed enhanced immunity against earlier variants but reduced nAb potency and T cell responses against Omicron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. This was not exactly the case in our study, indicating that in addition to imprinted memory, responses targeting novel antigens can be generated. Besides the RBD, antibodies targeting other regions of the spike, such as the NTD or S2 region may also broaden the humoral response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The interval between prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and booster vaccination impacts magnitude and quality of antibody and B cell responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This raises important questions regarding the frequency of booster doses, particularly in the presence of Omicron variants with greater immune evasion properties.</p><p id="P27">There are several limitations to our study, notably the limited number of individuals analyzed. However, the differences between strains and categories of individuals were sufficiently marked to reach statistical significance. We did not consider the effect of innate and cellular immunity on BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6. and BQ.1.1 strains. We focused our work on Pfizer vaccine recipients and did not assess the neutralization conferred by a fourth dose. We did not characterize other Omicron subvariants, such as XBB, a recombinant virus between two Omicron strains (BJ.1 and BM.1.1). Future studies will help evaluating long-term immune responses to Omicron subvariants after infection and/or vaccination.</p><p id="P28">In summary, we show here that the few convergent mutations present in the spike of BA.2 or BA.5 subvariants led to resistance to most of available therapeutic mAbs and strongly impaired the efficacy of vaccine-elicited antibodies. Breakthrough infections in triply vaccinated individuals stimulate cross-neutralizing responses with distinct efficacy depending on the variant responsible for the infection.
