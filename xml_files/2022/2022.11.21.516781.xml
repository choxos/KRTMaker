Although nerve injury is known to cause transcriptional dysregulation, how this differs across neuronal subtypes and the impact of sex is unclear. Here, we study the deep transcriptional profiles of multiple murine DRG populations in early and late pain states while considering sex. We have exploited currently available transgenics to label numerous subpopulations for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptomic analysis. Using bulk tissue samples, we are able to circumvent the issues of low transcript coverage and drop-outs seen with single cell datasets. This increases our power to detect novel and even subtle changes in gene expression within neuronal subtypes and discuss sexual dimorphism at the neuronal subtype level. We have curated this resource into an accessible database for other researchers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/">https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/</ext-link>). We see both stereotyped and unique subtype signatures in injured states after nerve injury at both an early and late timepoint. While all populations contribute to a general injury signature, subtype enrichment changes can also be seen. Within populations, there is not a strong intersection of sex and injury, but previously unknown sex differences in naïve states-particularly in A<italic>β</italic>-RA + A<italic>δ</italic>-LTMRs - still contribute to differences in injured neurons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chronic pain conditions affect up to 25% of the global population.

These neurons encompass a diverse collection of subtypes that are grouped by various factors, each intrinsically related. These include size, myelination, conduction velocity, projection patterns, end organ innervation, and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dubin and Patapoutian (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Handler and Ginty (2021)</xref>).</p><p id="P4">More recently, single cell and single nuclear RNA-seq in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Usoskin et al.

Gene expression differs between these broad neuronal subpopulations and is indeed predictive of their functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zheng et al. (2019)</xref>). The diversity across subtypes is lost during bulk RNA-seq, due to the consolidation of all subtypes together. In single cell datasets, pseudo-bulk samples can be generated for each cluster, but this relies on a well-defined clustering that can be lost after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nguyen et al. (2019)</xref>). As such, changes at a subtype level remain unclear in painful states, and is the focus of the current study through the use of transgenic labelling and deep RNA-seq across populations.</p><p id="P5">Understanding sexual dimorphism in pain states is also a fundamental clinical issue. Females are much more likely to be living with chronic pain, and treatment efficacy can be sex-dependant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Greenspan et al.

In naïve states, quantitative sensory testing has also highlighted heightened pain sensitivity in females to a battery of acute noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bartley and Fillingim (2013)</xref>). The case for studying sexual dimorphism is not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Berkley (1992)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Unruh (1996)</xref>), but historical biases within the research community resulted in a predominantly male focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shansky (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mogil (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wald and Wu (2010)</xref>).</p><p id="P6">More recent female-inclusive studies have revealed clear mechanistic differences between sexes at the immune and nervous system level.

We have studied the molecular changes in five populations: <italic>Scn10a</italic>-expressing DRG, peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors, as well as C-LTMRs and <italic>Ntrk2</italic>-expressing A-LTMRs. In a naïve state, we find subtype-specific sexual dimorphism in a small number of genes. This does not translate to a strong interaction of sex and injury, as the injury response seems to be consistent across sexes at the neuronal transcript level. We also see both stereotyped and unique subpopulation signatures in injured states after nerve injury at both an acute (3 day) and late (4 week) timepoint, with notable changes in C-LTMR and NP populations, as well as a distinct transcriptional program in A<italic>β</italic>-RA + A<italic>δ</italic>-LTMRs by 4 weeks compared to the other subtypes in the study.

Across subpopulations, most genes are expressed to similar levels in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). DEGs are defined here as an FDR &lt; 0.05 and an absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change (LFC) &gt; 1. From this, only six genes were significantly regulated between males and females in all populations, each X- or Y-linked (<italic>Kdm5d</italic>, <italic>Uty</italic>, <italic>Ddx3y</italic>, <italic>Eif2s3y</italic>, <italic>Tsix</italic>, <italic>Xist</italic>). <italic>Gm29650</italic>, which is also sex-linked, was differentially expressed in 4/5 populations. The only other DEG shared across any subtypes is <italic>Sprr1a</italic>, which is more highly expressed in male nociceptors and non-peptidergic nociceptors, and may reflect differences in naïve cells, or minor wounds from in-cage fighting which occur at higher rates in males.</p><p id="P21">This absence of a large sensory-neuron wide sex signature is consistent with previous work in mice, where all but one DEG reported in adult, lumbar DRG were X- or Y- linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith-Anttila et al. (2020)</xref>). Nine autosomal genes were found to be regulated in sacral DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith-Anttila et al.

Across populations, many genes hit an FDR &lt; 0.05, but moderated fold changes suggest a negligible effect (near 0 LFC) in these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplemental Table 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">5</xref>). The majority of DEGs are seen in lowly expressed genes within unique neuronal subtypes. We see predominant transcriptional changes within A<italic>β</italic>-RA + A<italic>δ</italic>-LTMRs (202 genes with FDR &lt; 0.05, LFC &gt; 1), with few differences in the other populations. Here, RNA-seq and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization validation of <italic>Kcnj11</italic> and <italic>Kcns1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>) suggest they are more strongly expressed in female TRKB+ LTMRs. <italic>KCNS1</italic> has previously been suggested as a marker of LTMRs in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tavares-Ferreira et al.

For other genes, such as <italic>Npy</italic>, gene expression increases from 3 days to 4 weeks, where it is significantly higher than contralateral levels, suggesting a more long term change.</p><p id="P28">In a more acute state, GO analyses show enrichment in the regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, and inflammatory response after injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 10</xref>). Many of these processes remain enriched at 4 weeks, even with the overall reduction in DEGs. GSEA enrichment at 3 days also shows downregulation of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation paired to a positive enrichment of inflammation, receptor regulator activity, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 11</xref>). When comparing ipsilateral samples over time, GO analyses also suggest functional changes. Three day injured samples show enrichment of apoptotic process, cytokine response and, and positive regulation of gene expression. In a later state, there is an enrichment for protein import, long-term memory, and the regulation of long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these results suggest we are accurately capturing injury signatures across our dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Injury phenotypes by subtype</title><p id="P29">A major strength of this study is the ability to probe subtype specific patterns in a murine model of neuropathic pain.

We have built on this with added data after injury, giving insight to possible nociceptor-enriched transcription factors involved in injury. For example, <italic>Isl2</italic> encodes Insulin related protein 2 and is regulated after injury in our dataset. It also shows regulation in human patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, suggesting cross-species, cross-model target for future experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hall et al.

When comparing all ipsilateral samples, we see a reduction in NP and C-LTMR enrichment more chronically. Population data was pooled for GSEA analyses across timepoints, so changes in gene signatures can be difficult to interpret. For example, if we are working with the assumption that injured NP cells die after SNI, as suggested in West <italic>et al</italic>. 2020, and hinted at by the loss of IB4-binding terminals after nerve injury in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bailey and Ribeiro-Da-Silva (2006)</xref>), the ipsilateral NP samples by 4 weeks are likely to contain primarily intact neurons (opposed to cell bodies from transected afferents). The significant reduction of an NP signature over time may thus result from changes in the intact NP neurons, or a bias in the general nociceptor population, which shows enrichment for both PEP and NP nociceptors in a naïve state. C-LTMRs show a similar pattern to NP, although we have not queried the loss of this population to the same extent as NP. Together, this is an interested area for future follow-up, as cell loss has also been documented in human patients with neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hall et al. (2022)</xref>).

Using an LFC cutoff of 1, we see significant upregulation of multiple injury genes, and a significant enrichment of a general injury signature in the ipsilateral samples across all subtypes.

The consequence of this is unclear, with multiple, non-mutually-exclusive hypotheses available. For example, do nociceptors develop a more LTMR-like signature?

Do A<italic>δ</italic>-LTMRs show a more injured phenotype in naïve states? We cannot conclusively exclude this latter possibility, but key injury genes are not present in the gene set curated from Zheng and colleagues, and our contralateral <italic>Ntrk2</italic> samples are negatively enriched for our general injury signature at both timepoints.

The pooled library was diluted to 10 nM for storage. The 10 nM library was denatured and further diluted prior to loading on the sequencer. Sequencing was performed over three independent runs, and merged after quality control. Paired end sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq6000 platform using the S2/S4 reagent kit v1.5. Samples were sequenced with a 150 bp read length, at a depth of 30 million reads per sample. Raw data is available on GEO (GSE216444).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="S23"><title>Overview</title><p id="P70">Reads were mapped to the GRCm38 (mm10) Mouse Genome using STAR alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dobin and Gingeras (2013)</xref>).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 5000 ENSEMBL genes ranked by standard deviation. Sample distances are proportional to Mahalanobis distance, and ellipses show the 95% confidence interval of a condition’s gene expression distribution. Hierarchical clustering was done on transformed counts using Euclidean distances and complete linkage. Gene enrichment within neuronal subtypes was calculated using VST counts, and was defined as genes with a subpopulation mean within the top 75% of expressed genes, across contralateral samples.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Custom GSEA</title><p id="P74">Deep RNA-seq of naïve DRG subpopulations has been previously performed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zheng et al.

Within each subpopulation, genes with a mean rlog above the 95% quantile cut-off were curated into a ‘gene set’ for subpopulation enrichment.
