The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not include ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors. Here we focus on very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions, evaluating how well they can be expected to describe the structure of a protein in a particular environment. We compare predictions with experimental crystallographic maps of the same proteins for 102 crystal structures. In many cases, those parts of AlphaFold predictions that were predicted with very high confidence matched experimental maps remarkably closely. In other cases, these predictions differed from experimental maps on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation, and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. Overall, C<sub>α</sub> atoms in very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions differed from corresponding crystal structures by a median of 0.6 Å, and about 10% of these differed by more than 2 Å, each about twice the values found for pairs of crystal structures containing the same components but determined in different space groups. We suggest considering AlphaFold predictions as exceptionally useful hypotheses. We further suggest that it is important to consider the confidence in prediction when interpreting AlphaFold predictions and to carry out experimental structure determination to verify structural details, particularly those that involve interactions not included in the prediction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Protein structure predictions using AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, RoseTTAFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, and related methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> are far more accurate than previous generations of prediction algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, bringing much closer to reality the biological understanding that could be derived from knowing the three-dimensional structures of all macromolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

Using comparisons that focus on local accuracy, predictions obtained with AlphaFold have been assessed as having “atomic accuracy”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, as having accuracies competitive with “the best experimental results”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and being of comparable quality as an experimental crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. It has been argued that AlphaFold predictions might be more accurate than estimated by comparison with models in the PDB, or even more accurate than the deposited models, because the deposited models are poorly defined in some places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This reasoning notes that side-chain positions and loops are sometimes not clear in crystallographic electron density maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and in such cases a difference between an AlphaFold prediction and a deposited model would not indicate an error in the prediction. On the other hand, analyses carried out by the DeepMind team and others show that AlphaFold predictions vary substantially in their global and local agreement with deposited models and also in their coverage at the highest levels of confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, with only 36% of residues in the human proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and 73% of residues in <italic>E. coli</italic> modeled with very high confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

We put these results into context by examining how closely one crystal structure in the PDB can typically be reproduced by another crystal structure containing the same components, but crystallized in a different space group (resulting in different crystal contacts).</p><sec id="S1"><title>Comparing AlphaFold predictions with crystallographic electron density maps</title><p id="P6">We used a set of crystallographic electron density maps determined without reference to deposited models as standards for evaluation of AlphaFold predictions. The density maps were obtained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> using iterated AlphaFold prediction and model rebuilding with X-ray crystallographic data deposited in the PDB. For the present work we selected a high-quality subset of 102 models and maps from this analysis consisting of those that had free R values of 0.30 or better. The density maps in our analysis do not have any bias towards deposited models, as no information from deposited structures was used to compute these maps. Therefore, if features of a prediction are incompatible with the density maps and different from the deposited model, they are likely to be incorrect representations of the actual molecule in the crystal.</p><p id="P7">AlphaFold predictions are produced with residue-specific confidence metrics (pLDDT) which are estimates of the local accuracy of the prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

The density map is less clear in this region than in other parts of the map. A break in main-chain density at D102 suggests that the chain adopts multiple conformations in this region. It is possible that the conformation in the AlphaFold prediction could be one of these alternative conformations, though not a dominant one as it does not appear in the density map.</p><p id="P12"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> illustrates a case where the AlphaFold prediction is distorted relative to the density map (PDB entry 7naz).

To determine whether this occurs for many AlphaFold predictions, we “morphed” each AlphaFold prediction to make it more similar to the deposited model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Materials and Methods</xref>). This process reduces differences between predictions and deposited models that arise from either distortion or alternate locations of domains within chains. After morphing each predicted model, the predictions agree more closely with the electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, solid bars, mean map correlation of 0.67 vs 0.56 before morphing), but still much less closely than the deposited models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, hatched bars, mean map correlation of 0.86).</p><p id="P15">If two models are related by a long-range distortion or alternate locations of domains, inter-atomic distances that are short will be similar in the two models, while those that are long will differ. We quantified this relationship by comparing inter-atomic distances in predicted models with matching distances in deposited models and examining the median differences as a function of distance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> shows that this median inter-atomic distance deviation between deposited models and moderate-to-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions (pLDDT above 70) is about 0.1 Å for atom pairs that are close (between 4 Å and 8 Å apart) and increases to 0.7 Å for distant atom pairs (48 Å – 52 Å), indicating a typical distortion of about 0.5-1 Å over this range of distances. As a reference, we analyzed 926 pairs of high-resolution structures in the PDB that had identical sequences but were obtained in different crystallographic space groups (so that crystal contacts influencing conformation would differ). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> shows that atom pairs in these matching structures had distances that differed by a rms of 0.1 Å for nearby residues and 0.4 Å for distant ones, about half the values found for AlphaFold predictions.</p><p id="P16">As a third method of assessing distortion and differences in domain relationships in AlphaFold predictions, we compared them with the corresponding models from the PDB, calculating the rmsd of C<sub>α</sub> atoms both before and after applying the distortion field described above. For this analysis we used all 215 structures analyzed in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> shows the distribution of C<sub>α</sub> rmsd values for the AlphaFold predictions; the median rmsd is 1.0 Å. After applying the distortion field, the median rmsd is reduced to 0.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, the median rsmd distortion applied was 0.6 Å). For matching pairs of structures in the PDB crystallized in different space groups, the median C<sub>α</sub> rmsd was only 0.6 Å, and this could be reduced to 0.4 Å by applying a distortion field (median rms distortion applied of 0.2 Å). Overall, the C<sub>α</sub> coordinates in AlphaFold predictions are considerably more different from PDB entries than deposits of high-resolution structures of the same molecule in different space groups are from each other (median rmsd of 1.0 Å vs 0.6 Å), and a substantial part of this difference consists of long-range distortion.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Comparing AlphaFold side-chain predictions with experimental density maps</title><p id="P17">As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, AlphaFold predictions often contain at least some regions that are similar to deposited structures, but even in these regions many details often differ. We used the 102 electron density maps described above along with deposited models to evaluate side-chain conformations (the locations of atoms in side chains relative to the atoms in the main chain that they are connected to), an important local feature of a structural model. In order to analyze the local side-chain structure and remove confounding effects from domain shifts or distortions, we grafted the side chain from each residue in an AlphaFold prediction onto the corresponding main chain atoms residue of the deposited model. This yielded a composite model with the main-chain coordinates of the deposited models and side-chain conformations corresponding to the AlphaFold predictions.</p><p id="P18"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a local portion of PDB entry 7vgm, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> shows the AlphaFold prediction superimposed on the deposited model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref> shows the same region with the grafted side chain and the composite model. The positions of several of the side chains in the AlphaFold model (e.g., R32, D62, E530, E533, R494) are different from those in the deposited model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> shows the deposited model for 7vgm along with the density map obtained for PDB entry 7vgm, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> shows the AlphaFold model superimposed on the same density map. Even though the density map was obtained with the AlphaFold prediction and without reference to the deposited model, all the side chains in the deposited model match the map closely. In contrast, side chains in the AlphaFold prediction that were different from those in the deposited model do not match the density map, both before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>) grafting, indicating that these side-chain conformations are likely to be incorrect.</p><p id="P19">We carried out this side-chain grafting procedure for 102 AlphaFold predictions and the corresponding deposited models. For each pair of side chains, we examined the agreement between atomic positions in that side chain and the corresponding optimized density map. We identified pairs in which the AlphaFold side-chain prediction differed substantially from the deposited model (rmsd of side-chain atoms &gt; 1.5 Å). Then based on estimates of the uncertainty of density values in each map and of the number of independent points sampled by side-chain atomic positions in that map, we identified AlphaFold side-chain predictions that differed from the deposited model and were highly unlikely (p &lt; 0.01) to be as compatible with the density map as the deposited model. We considered these AlphaFold side-chain predictions to be incompatible with the experimental data.</p><p id="P20">Overall, we found that 20% of the side chains in moderate-to-high confidence residues of AlphaFold predictions and not involved in crystal contacts had different conformations than in the corresponding deposited model (at least 1.5 Å rmsd), and one third of these (7% overall) were clearly incompatible with the experimental data. As the number of clearly-incompatible residues identified by our method is a lower estimate, we expect that the actual level of disagreement between AlphaFold predictions and conformations of the molecules in the crystals is somewhere between the 7% that are clearly incompatible with the data and the 20% that differ from the deposited models.</p><p id="P21">To put the fraction of side-chain positions in AlphaFold predictions that are incompatible with the experimental data into perspective, we carried out a similar analysis, but using the set of high-resolution structures from the PDB containing the same components but crystallized in a different space group. For these tests we used experimentally-based density maps (2mFo-DFc maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> calculated using one model from each pair. Here, only 6% of the side chains differed by 1.5 Å rmsd, and only 2% were in conformations that were experimentally incompatible with the corresponding conformations from the other set. Therefore, at a detailed level as well as an overall level, the differences between AlphaFold predictions and these crystal structures are substantially greater than for pairs of crystal structures determined in different space groups.</p><p id="P22">We then analyzed whether the 7% of residues in AlphaFold predictions that were incompatible with experimental data included residues with functional significance. We extracted all the residues that were explicitly mentioned in the 49 publications describing the 102 analyzed structures, yielding a total of 733 named residues. Of these, 53 (7%) were among the residues we identified as being incompatible with experimental data, the same percentage that we found for all residues. For example, residues R32, D62, R497 and E533 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> are all in this group of functional residues that are incompatible with experimental data.</p><p id="P23">As functionally significant residues are constrained by evolution, it might have been expected that the evolutionary covariation that forms a central element of AlphaFold prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> would be stronger than average. On the other hand, these same residues are more conserved than average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, possibly balancing that effect. In our small sample, we do not see a substantial effect either way, rather we find that side chains for residues in AlphaFold predictions with functional significance are about as likely to be incompatible with experimental data as other side chains.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Using confidence (pLDDT) to estimate errors in AlphaFold predictions</title><p id="P24">As AlphaFold predictions can differ substantially from corresponding experimental models, straightforward methods to estimate coordinate uncertainties of these predictions would be useful. As a first step, we superimposed AlphaFold predictions on corresponding deposited models and determined the distance between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms in the predicted and deposited models, as well as the confidence (pLDDT) for the predicted C<sub>α</sub> atom.</p><p id="P25"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the distribution of prediction errors for various ranges of the confidence measure. For comparison, the dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the distribution of differences between matching C<sub>α</sub> atoms in pairs of structures containing the same components but crystallized in different space groups. The median prediction error for high-confidence (pLDDT &gt; 90) residues was 0.6 Å, while for residues with pLDDT between 80 and 90 it was 1.1 Å, and for those between 70 and 80 it was 1.5 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>). By comparison, matching C<sub>α</sub> atoms in pairs of structures in different space groups differed by a median of 0.3 Å. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> shows that morphing one member of each pair as described above reduces the differences over all confidence ranges, but differences between matching pairs of structures in the PDB are reduced similarly.</p><p id="P26">The significance of the median coordinate errors found above depends on what the coordinates are going to be used for<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. If coordinates are intended for use in comparing distantly-related structures to infer evolutionary and structural relationships, where typical differences among structures may be large (for example, 2 – 3 Å), median coordinate errors of 1.1 Å may have little effect on the analysis. On the other hand, the same coordinate errors might substantially affect an analysis involving docking of a ligand to identify specific protein-ligand interactions.</p><p id="P27">We note the distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> do not resemble the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution expected for random 3-dimensional Gaussian errors (there is an excess kurtosis of over 200 for errors in prediction vs an expected value of 0.1). The distributions have a small fraction of values that are very large (long tails in the distributions), so describing uncertainties in terms of rms errors may not ordinarily be effective. Instead, it may be more useful to note the median errors described above as a measure of typical errors, and to also take into account the percentage of instances where the error is very large (i.e., completely wrong). The definition of very large errors will depend on the situation, but often atomic positions that deviate by more than 2 or 3 Å are of limited value.</p><p id="P28">For the structures analyzed here, about 10% of C<sub>α</sub> atoms with pLDDT over 90 are found to be in error by over 2 Å, along with 22% of those with pLDDT between 80 and 90, 33% of those between 70 and 80, and 77% of those with pLDDT under 70 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>). For comparison, just 5% of C<sub>α</sub> atoms in the matched pairs of structures in the PDB crystallized in different space groups we analyzed differ by over 2 Å.</p><p id="P29">The extent of agreement between AlphaFold predictions and experimental data found here is consistent with results of the uncertainty quantification carried out by DeepMind during the development of AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. That analysis showed that estimated model accuracy (pLDDT) was an unbiased predictor of actual model accuracy (LDDT), and that the correlation between pLDDT estimates and actual LDDT was about 0.76. The uncertainty quantification further estimated that 7% (for pLDDT &gt; 90) to 30% (for 70 &lt; pLDDT &lt; 90) of side chains have a χ<sub>1</sub> angle deviation of at least 40°. Such a deviation typically leads to an rmsd of side-chain atoms of over 1.5 Å. In our analysis, the average pLDDT was 94, with 12% of residues having a pLDDT between 70 and 90. Therefore, the errors estimated in AlphaFold development are generally consistent with our observation that between 7% and 20% of side chains with pLDDT of 70 or above are incompatible with experimental data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P30">While AlphaFold predictions are often astonishingly accurate (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>), we find that many parts of AlphaFold predictions are incompatible with experimental data from corresponding crystal structures. In particular, our results show that AlphaFold predictions are not better representations of the contents of a crystal than the models deposited in the PDB, as the deposited models agree much more closely with experimental data where the predicted and deposited models differ. Our results also show that even very high confidence AlphaFold predictions differ from corresponding models deposited in the PDB by about twice as much as pairs of high-resolution structures in the PDB that were crystallized in different space groups, indicating that AlphaFold predictions are in error by more than the amount that might be expected due to flexibility. We note that as AlphaFold prediction does not take into account the presence of ligands, ions, covalent modifications, or environmental conditions, it cannot be expected to correctly represent the many details of protein structures that depend on these factors.</p><p id="P31">A confidence metric (pLDDT) is produced for each AlphaFold prediction. This confidence metric was examined in detail by the DeepMind team and was shown to be unbiased (equally likely to be too low or too high) and to have a good correlation to the LDDT metric that it estimates (Pearson’s correlation of 0.76)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This confidence metric can therefore be a very useful residue-specific indicator of the accuracy of a prediction. For the structures examined here, the parts of AlphaFold predictions that had very high confidence (pLDDT &gt; 90, 86% of residues in the analysis) were generally quite accurate (median C<sub>α</sub> coordinate difference from deposited model of 0.6 Å). It is important to note, however, that about 10% of residues predicted with very high confidence differed from the deposited model by over 2 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Despite their limitations, AlphaFold predictions are already changing the way that hypotheses about protein structures are generated and tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed, even though not all parts of AlphaFold predictions are accurate, they provide plausible hypotheses that can suggest mechanisms of action and allow designing experiments with specific expected outcomes. Using these predictions as starting hypotheses can also greatly accelerate the process of experimental structure determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. AlphaFold predictions often have very good stereochemical characteristics, making them excellent hypotheses for local structural features. For example, for the 102 structures analyzed here, the mean percentage of residues with “favored” Ramachandran configurations was 98%, greater than that of the corresponding deposited models (97%), and the mean percentage of side-chain conformations classified as outliers was just 0.2%, compared with 1.5% for deposited models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Such AlphaFold predictions with highly plausible geometry could be used in later stages of experimental structure determination as potential conformations for segments of structure that are not fully clear in experimental density maps.</p><p id="P33">All these capabilities are very likely just the beginning of an age of increasingly broad use of AI methods in structural biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. AI approaches will surely be extended from proteins to include nucleic acids, ligands, covalent modifications, environmental conditions, interactions among all these entities, and multiple structural states. The accuracies of these predictions and of the uncertainties associated with them are very likely to improve continuously as additional factors are included and as databases of sequence and structural information expand. The resulting predictions will be increasingly useful structural hypotheses that will form a solid foundation for experimental and theoretical analyses of biological systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS157558-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Funding</title><p>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory grant DE-AC02-05CH11231 (PDA)</p><p>National Institutes of Health grant GM063210 (PDA, JSR, RJR, TCT)</p><p>Wellcome Trust grant 209407/Z/17/Z (RJR)</p><p>Phenix Industrial Consortium (PDA)</p></ack><sec id="S17" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p id="P34">Input data for deposited models were taken from the Protein Data Bank.
