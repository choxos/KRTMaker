It is catalysed by the divisome, a multi-protein complex with more than 20 components that spans the cell envelope in bacteria harbouring a cell wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Central to the divisome is the peptidoglycan-synthesising protein complex FtsWI, with the transglycosylase (TG) FtsW polymerising glycan strands from its substrate Lipid II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and the transpeptidase (TP) FtsI crosslinking peptide stems, thus forming a covalent mesh between glycan strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Septal peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after activation of the divisome glycosyltransferase-transpeptidase pair FtsWI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, in particular through an interaction with the heterotrimer FtsQBL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P2">Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the catalytic divisome core complex FtsWIQBL from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals the intricate details of the periplasmic interfaces within FtsWIQBL, including the positioning of FtsI by the coiled coil of FtsBL, as well as a transmembrane domain containing FtsWIBL but not FtsQ. With our structure we are able to provide molecular mechanisms of a multitude of known mutations that interfere with divisome activation and regulation. Finally, we reveal a large conformational switch between presumably inactive and active states of the FtsWI core enzymes.</p><p id="P3">Our work is foundational for further structural, biochemical and genetic studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bacterial cell division. Since the divisome peptidoglycan synthase is essential for cell division in most bacteria, and is absent in eukaryotic cells entirely, it is a key target of important antibiotics and antibiotic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and we suggest that our structure will help to accelerate these efforts.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Cryo-EM structure of the core divisome complex FtsWIQBL</title><p id="P4">To solve the structure of the core divisome complex, we initially purified the <italic>Escherichia coli Ec</italic>FtsWIQBL complex expressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>).

Density for the FtsQ transmembrane helix (FtsQ™) was not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). The detergent micelle density was subtracted from the final reconstruction and the position of the complex in the membrane was approximated using the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OMP) webserver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b, c</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The periplasmic domains of the <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL complex extend about 70 Å away from the membrane in a Y-shape, with the FtsI transpeptidase domain (FtsI<sup>TP</sup>) and the FtsQ β-domain (FtsQ<sup>β</sup>) located on opposite arms of the Y, and FtsBL connecting them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Interestingly, only FtsQ<sup>β</sup> is well-resolved, while density for the FtsQ polypeptide-transport-associated domain (FtsQ<sup>POTRA</sup>) is only visible in low-resolution maps at high contour level, and density for FtsQ™ is completely absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d</xref>). FtsQ<sup>POTRA</sup> adopts a slightly different orientation relative to FtsQ<sup>β</sup> compared to previously determined X-ray structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d</xref>). Taken together, this shows that FtsQ is tethered to FtsWILB only via its FtsQ<sup>β</sup>-FtsB interaction, while FtsQ<sup>POTRA</sup> and FtsQ™ are flexibly attached in the current complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). As FtsQ™ is not visible, we assume it is not in the micelle that contains the other TM segments but might be surrounded by detergent molecules separately. While it has been previously reported that FtsB dimerises and could thus facilitate the dimerisation of core divisome components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we find no evidence for higher oligomeric species in our cryo-EM data, and in our current structure dimerisation would be hindered by the presence of FtsI or FtsQ.</p><p id="P7">FtsL and FtsB have similar folds, each consisting of a long α-helical coiled coil, followed by a short α-helix and a β-strand. Interestingly, the FtsB α-helical coiled coil is interrupted by a small, conserved loop just above FtsB™ that might aid with sterically maintaining the correct insertion depth in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). FtsB and FtsL interact with each other over their entire lengths through mainly hydrophobic interactions, e.g. between FtsL<sup>α1</sup> and FtsB<sup>α2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The transglycosylase FtsW and transpeptidase FtsI share two interfaces. The first interface is in the membrane, where FtsI™ interacts with TM8 and TM9 of FtsW – an interaction that closely resembles that of the previously reported RodA-PBP2 elongasome complex from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic><sup><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></italic></sup>. The second interaction site is located between the extracellular loop 4 of FtsW (FtsW<sup>EC4</sup>) and the linker between FtsI™ and FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup>. Due to the flexibility of FtsI in this region, not all contacts could be determined unambiguously.</p><p id="P9">It has been previously reported that the cytoplasmic tail of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsL is required for the recruitment of FtsW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In the structure presented here, the FtsL cytoplasmic tail could not be traced unambiguously. This could either point towards a transient interaction during recruitment or species-specific differences in the recruitment due to the size of the cytoplasmic tail (11 residues in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> vs. 34 residues in <italic>E. coli</italic>). However, we clearly observe FtsL-FtsW interactions in the periplasm (FtsW<sup>EC1</sup> and FtsL<sup>α1</sup>), and within the membrane through FtsW<sup>TM1</sup> and the upper three turns of FtsL<sup>TM1</sup>. In the latter, the lower part of FtsL™ twists away from FtsW, due to its gyrating coiled-coil interaction with FtsB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>FtsIQBL interactions in the periplasm</title><p id="P10">FtsL and FtsI form an extensive interface in the periplasm, with a total buried surface area of 1035 Å<sup>2</sup>. The FtsL-FtsI interaction is facilitated by two sites: FtsL<sup>α1</sup>-FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup>, involving anchor and head subdomain residues in FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup>, and FtsL<sup>α2,β1</sup>-FtsI<sup>TP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Moving along the FtsL coil, the first mainly hydrophobic and neutral interactions occur between FtsL<sup>α1</sup> (residues L41-L48) and the anchor subdomain of FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup> (residues I58, R193, Q208-215, R193, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, panel 1). FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup> slightly wraps around FtsL<sup>α1</sup>, forming a hydrophilic interaction site (FtsI H61 with FtsL R51, D52 and Q55, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> panel 2). The final, and mainly hydrophobic, interaction site on FtsL<sup>α1</sup> involves residues A56-S66 and residues located mainly in the FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup> head subdomain (L64, P72-P78, F151-P156, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> panel 2). Importantly, no direct interaction was observed between the FtsB coiled coil and FtsI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The second FtsL–FtsI interaction site is located on top of the periplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> panel 3): FtsL<sup>α2,β1</sup>-FtsI<sup>TP</sup>. H71 of FtsL<sup>α2</sup> stacks against Y229 of FtsI<sup>TP</sup> and is flanked by additional residues in FtsB (E79, L80), FtsI (R233) and FtsL (E75). An additional hydrophobic interface site is formed by several proline residues in both FtsL and FtsI<sup>TP</sup> [P556, P557 (FtsI) – M94 (FtsL); P557, G478, P477 (FtsI) – P89 (FtsL); R551 (FtsI) - P87 (FtsL)]. Interestingly, FtsB<sup>α3</sup> and FtsB<sup>β1</sup> frame a loop in FtsQ between β-strands 11 and 12, forming the only interaction site between FtsI, FtsB and FtsQ [N554 (FtsI) – N265 (FtsQ) – Q91 (FtsB); R226 (FtsI) - P264 (FtsQ); R226 (FtsI) – H78 (FtsB, backbone), R551 (FtsI) – L80 (FtsB, backbone)]. FtsI adopts a structure very similar to previously reported crystal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, with only minor changes in the FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup> domain, indicating that FtsL binding does not cause large rearrangements in FtsI<sup>TP</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Only a few FtsL-FtsQ contacts are present, however FtsL completes an extended β-sheet formed between FtsQ<sup>β</sup> strands β5 to β12 and FtsB<sup>β1</sup>, by contributing its last β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> panel 3). The FtsB-FtsQ interaction recapitulates that of previously determined crystal structures where only small parts of FtsB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> were resolved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>). In addition, the cryo-EM structure shows an interaction between FtsB<sup>α2</sup> (starting from E53) and FtsQ<sup>β</sup> loops (R183, S212-R214, R231). Interruption of the FtsB-Q interface with inhibitors based on the minimal interface could be expected to also disrupt the interface in the context of the divisome core complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Comparison with RodA-PBP2 structures and structure predictions</title><p id="P13">Cell elongation in rod-shaped bacteria is facilitated by the elongasome that, like the divisome, polymerises and crosslinks PG, but is positioned throughout the cell envelope by MreB filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. RodA, the elongasome’s transglycosylase is related to FtsW and has previously been structurally characterised using X-ray crystallography both on its own and as a RodA-PBP2 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (the latter being homologous to FtsWI). The structures of <italic>Pa</italic>FtsW determined here and <italic>Tt</italic>RodA are very similar, with the exception of TM7, which appears to be somewhat flexible in the cryo-EM structure, straighter with respect to that of <italic>Tt</italic>RodA and closer to TM5 than in <italic>Tt</italic>RodA-PBP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4c</xref>). It has been postulated that the movement of TM7 could open a cavity for the binding of the lipid tail of Lipid II to RodA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and the location of TM7 in <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL creates such a cavity. The putative catalytic residue D275A is located in a deep, highly conserved cleft, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>, that we suggest might harbour the sugar moieties of Lipid II during the transglycosylase reaction.</p><p id="P14">The most striking observation when comparing <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL with <italic>Tt</italic>RodA-Pbp2 is the difference in the relative orientations of the TP with respect to the TG domain, despite the fact that the structures of the single proteins superimpose well on their own. Alignment of both complexes on the FtsW/RodA subunits places <italic>Pa</italic>FtsI<sup>TP</sup> and <italic>Tt</italic>PBP2<sup>TP</sup> almost opposite to each other, requiring a ~130° rotation of <italic>Pa</italic>FtsI<sup>TP</sup>/<italic>Tt</italic>PBP2<sup>TP</sup> for their interconversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). The reason for this large difference is unclear, but is possibly caused by the presence of FtsQBL in our divisome structure and the absence of binding partners such as MreCD in the elongasome structure. Alternatively, the differences could be intrinsic to the elongasome and divisome complexes or reflect different, distinct states in the regulatory/catalytic cycle of the enzyme complexes.</p><p id="P15">We used AlphaFold 2 multimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (AF2) to predict <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL and many large-scale and fine features observed in the <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL structure are predicted correctly by AF2, including the lack of an interaction between the membrane-embedded FtsQ™ and FtsWIBL™. However, in the AF2 model the periplasmic FtsIQBL interaction site is rotated upwards by about 30°, moving FtsI<sup>TP</sup> closer towards where the peptidoglycan layer is located (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). Furthermore, a small rearrangement in the anchor subdomain FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup>-FtsL<sup>α1</sup> shifts the interacting residues on FtsI<sup>pedestal</sup> from 208-212 to 203-206. To understand the implications of these differences, both structures were fitted into a to-scale model of the cell envelope of <italic>E. coli</italic>, produced from a cellular electron cryo-tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Using the cryo-EM structure, the active site of FtsI<sup>TP</sup> does not reach the peptidoglycan layer, but does so in the more extended AF2 model. Since AF2 uses evolutionary couplings between amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, in addition to protein structural features that correlate with sequence, it more likely predicts the active state of FtsWIQBL that one would expect to be selected for during evolution, and not the substrate-free form we determined experimentally. Thus, the cryo-EM structure and AF2 prediction may represent the inactive (apo) and active (catalytic) states of the divisome core complex, respectively. Since our sample is active in vitro, we assume that substrate binding by Lipid II might play a key role in the interconversion of the two states. Recently, a study on RodA-PBP2 reported a similar upswinging mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, which indicates that the concept of regulating the TP activity via restricting its access to the PG layer might be conserved between the divisome and the elongasome. However, significant differences exist between divisome and elongasome regarding the conformation before the upswinging motion and most likely also between the signals required to initiate this conformational change.</p><p id="P16">FtsN has been reported to trigger constriction in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. It is the last protein to be recruited to the division site in <italic>E. coli</italic> and its recruitment is dependent on the presence of earlier divisome proteins, including FtsA, FtsQ and FtsI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, we have not been able to generate a biochemically-stable <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsN-FtsWIQLB complex and previous studies reported that the addition of the FtsN periplasmic domain did not yield an increase in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> TG activity <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></italic></sup>. Whether FtsN activates the core divisome beyond the TG activity levels seen here through binding of FtsQLB, or whether the <italic>in vitro</italic> sample cannot be further activated will need further investigations including addition of other divisome components, e.g. FtsA, FtsN and/or DedD, as well as the substrate Lipid II. It is also possible that FtsN is involved in regulating TP activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interactions that affect divisome regulation</title><p id="P17">The Constriction Control Domain (CCD) of the divisome was identified previously from a set of mutations that allow partial or complete bypass of the requirement for FtsN in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In our structure these residues cluster at the top of FtsL<sup>α1</sup> and FtsB<sup>α2</sup>, with the FtsB CCD mutations facing FtsQ<sup>β</sup>. Furthermore, in close proximity are the Activation of FtsWI (AWI) residues on FtsL<sup>α1</sup> that display a dominant-negative phenotype when mutated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The CCD residues of FtsB<sup>E56</sup> (<italic>Ec</italic>E61G/A/K/V/H) and FtsL<sup>Q65</sup> (<italic>Ec</italic>E88K/V) point inwards into a positively charged cavity formed by three arginine residues (FtsQ<sup>R214</sup>, FtsQ<sup>R231</sup>, FtsB<sup>R75</sup>), flanked by FtsL<sup>T69</sup> (<italic>Ec</italic>D93G, CCD residue) on one side and FtsB<sup>E64</sup> (<italic>Ec</italic>D59V, CCD residue) and FtsB<sup>T71</sup> on the other side. This interface contains many charged and highly conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), and removal of a charge or introduction of the opposite charge could well result in destabilisation of the interface and potentially increased flexibility of the protein.

To further our understanding of divisome recruitment and regulation, in the future larger divisome complexes will need to be assembled. For example, divisome interactions with FtsA, through FtsN, FtsK and possibly FtsQ have the potential to modify the conformations, oligomeric states and activities of the core complex and its enzymes.</p><p id="P22">We report the structure of the essential bacterial cell division complex and important antibiotic target FtsWIQBL from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and show that <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL forms a stable Y-shaped complex that harbours intrinsic TG activity. Our <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL structure is able to explain many subunit contacts that have previously been shown to be important through loss-of-function and bypass mutations. In addition, the generated AF2 model reveals a different, likely catalytically competent state that allows for peptidoglycan crosslinking by FtsI. While our analysis hints at the nature of the catalytic state, further research is needed to resolve more states and their associated conformation changes, which possibly requires the addition of activating proteins such as FtsA and/or FtsN as well as the substrate Lipid II and its derivatives or products as ligands. It will be particularly exciting to resolve the enzymatic mechanism of the FtsW TG since it is a very promising drug target for novel antibiotics. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the divisome, the inclusion of upstream and downstream proteins e.g., FtsEX, FtsK, PBP1b, and DamX will also be necessary. Our work is an important milestone in the 25-year quest for a molecular understanding of the ancient, near ubiquitous and medically important process of FtsZ-based bacterial cell division.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Cloning</title><sec id="S8"><title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> FtsWIQLB</title><p id="P23">Cloning, expression and purification of <italic>Pa</italic>FtsWIQBL (Uniprot: Q9HW00 (FtsW), G3XD46 (FtsI), G3XDA7 (FtsQ), Q9HVZ6 (FtsL), Q9HXZ6 (FtsB)) were adapted from a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">1</xref></sup>.

The sample was resuspended in 5 mL water, stirred for 2 h at room temperature and then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. The filtrate was pipetted into a tared tube, frozen on dry ice and then freeze dried. The residue was dissolved in water to make a 10 mM stock, aliquoted and stored at -20°C.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Transglycosylase activity assay</title><p id="P40">Lipid II used to monitor glycosyltransferase activity of the protein complex was dried using a nitrogen stream and dissolved in an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The reaction and detection of glycan strands was adopted from previously published protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">22</xref></sup>.

Proteins were heat inactivated for 2 min at 95°C. Lipid II and glycan strands were labelled by incubating the reaction with 26 μM <italic>Sa</italic>Pbp4 and 20 mM BDL for 1 h at 25°C. An equal volume of Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer was added and the mixtures were heat inactivated for 3 min at 95°C. Glycan strands were separated from Lipid II on a 4-20% Criterion TGX polyacrylamide gel (Bio Rad), run for 45 min at 200 V. After blotting onto PVDF membrane, the blot was incubated for 2 h in Superblock blocking buffer TBS (Thermo Scientific), followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of IRDye800CW Streptavidin (LI_COR Bioscience) in TBS buffer at room temperature for 1 hr. The blot was washed three times in PBS buffer and bands were visualised using an Odyssey CLx imaging system (Li-COR Bioscience).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Electron cryo-tomography of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells</title><p id="P41">A culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain B/r H266 expressing plasmid pRBJ212<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">23</xref></sup> were grown in LB media at 37°C, 180 rpm to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Cells were concentrated 10x by centrifugation and mixed with 10 nm protein A gold fiducials in a 1:10 ratio. 4 μL of this mixture was applied to 200-mesh copper grids with a Quantifoil R2/2 support film, back-blotted and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a manual plunger. Cells were thinned for electron cryo-tomography by cryo-focused ion beam milling (cryoFIB) using a Scios dual beam FIB-SEM (FEI). Before milling, grids were sputtered with a protective layer of organic platinum using the gas injection system. Lamellae were milled in a stepwise fashion, gradually reducing the beam current as the lamellae were thinned, starting at 1 nA and polishing at 30 pA and at a nominal milling angle of 10°. CryoET was carried out on a Krios microscope (ThermoFisher) equipped with a Gatan imaging filter and K2 camera. Tilt series were collected using serialEM software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">24</xref></sup>, using a bidirectional tilt scheme from -10° (to flatten the lamella) with a 2° increment and a total dose of 112 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, divided over 56 images, each with 10 frames. The pixel size was 3.7 Å and the defocus target was -5 μm. Frame alignment and tilt series alignment were performed using IMOD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">25</xref></sup> and a 2x binned aligned tilt series was generated. The aligned tilt series were used to generate a SIRT reconstruction using tomo3D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">26</xref></sup>, which was then low-pass filtered to 20 Å.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157436-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d72aAdJbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the MRC LMB electron microscopy facility for excellent EM support and T.

The complex contains 14 transmembrane helices – ten from FtsW and one each from FtsIQLB. The transglycosylase FtsW catalyses the polymerisation of GlcNAc-MurNAc disaccharides from Lipid II. The transpeptidase FtsI crosslinks the peptides from the nascent chain to adjacent peptides in the peptidoglycan layer between residues three and four.
