(CWs) represent a global and escalating health burden causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Estimated to cost Medicare up to $96.8 billion pa and with a profound paucity of effective therapeutics, novel interventions to rescue the stalled healing response of CWs are urgently needed. In this study, we assess the impact of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) agonism on acute wound healing using a selective agonist, BMS-470539 (MC1R-Ag). MC1R-Ag accelerated wound closure and reepithelialisation in wildtype but not MC1Re/e mice, which harbour a non-functional receptor. MC1R-Ag improved wound perfusion and lymphatic drainage by promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, reducing local oxidative stress and inflammation with a knock-on effect of reduced scarring. To assess whether manipulating MC1R would be of benefit in pathological healing, we developed a novel murine model of CWs. By combining advanced age and locally elevated oxidative stress, factors shown to be present in most human CWs regardless of category, resultant wounds expand into the surrounding tissue, generate exudate and slough. Histological comparisons to human CWs demonstrate robust recapitulation of the hallmarks of human disease, including hyperproliferative epidermis and fibrinous exudate. Leveraging this model, we demonstrate that topical administration of MC1R-Ag, following ulcer debridement, rescues the stalled healing response, whereas abrogation of MC1R signalling in MC1Re/e mice exacerbates CWs. Collectively, we highlight MC1R agonism as a candidate therapeutic approach for acute and CWs and remove a critical barrier in CW research by providing a novel preclinical model.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Skin is a fascinating and complex barrier organ comprising multiple layers and cell types that are functionally distinct. Repair of adult cutaneous wounds is typically described in terms of four overlapping, sequential phases: coagulation, inflammation, proliferation/migration and remodelling, culminating in scar formation. Most wounds progress through the phases of healing uneventfully, with the magnitude of the inflammatory response linked to the extent of the resultant scar. However, a growing number of wounds fail to progress through the healing phases in an orderly and timely manner, resulting in a persistent open skin ulcer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These chronic wounds (CWs), including venous leg ulcers (VLU), diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and pressure ulcers (PU), become ‘stuck’ in a chronically inflamed state, unable to heal effectively. CWs represent a global and escalating health burden due to a sharp rise in worldwide incidence of key comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity and advanced age. CW complications include infection, amputation, sepsis and death; hence they impose substantial morbidity and mortality on the individual, healthcare systems and society, with approximately £12 billion pa spent by the NHS on 3.8 million wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Whilst many other fields have made inspiring leaps in understanding their respective pathologies, resulting in the development of promising therapeutics, research into CWs has long been neglected. Firstly, access to human wound biopsies is not trivial since the necessary infrastructure to obtain these is not readily available to many researchers. Secondly, the lack of a humane animal model that faithfully recapitulates the key features of human CWs has severely hampered CW research. These issues have therefore compromised innovation in new therapies, clinical practices and biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To remove a major barrier for CW research, we have developed an ethical, reproducible, genetically tractable model that reproduces key features of human CWs, including hyperproliferative epidermis, parakeratosis, spongiosis, vasculitis, fibrinous exudate, erythrocyte extravasation, wound expansion and slough generation. We specifically sought to develop a model that is broadly relevant across the ulcer categories of VLU, DFU and PU, rather than specifically modelling a certain category. Whilst each type of CW is associated with certain comorbidities, for example PU with conditions causing immobility; at their core they share key features. The overwhelming majority of skin ulcers develop in the over 50s, with 95 percent occurring in the over 60s. In addition, VLU, DFU and PU have been shown to exhibit high levels of wound bed oxidative stress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). We therefore used aged animals (18 months) and local elevation of oxidative stress to develop our preclinical model.</p><p id="P5">This novel model enables the <italic>in vivo</italic> study of candidate therapies to rescue derailed healing responses. Herein, we explore the therapeutic potential of Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) agonism for treatment of acute and chronic wounds. MC1R is a GPCR expressed peripherally in melanocytes and immune cells, with roles in pigmentation and regulation of anti-oxidative stress mechanisms following UV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). With a functional MC1R, eumelanin, a black pigment, is preferentially produced. A highly polymorphic gene, <italic>MC1R</italic> loss-of-function SNPs result in preferential production of the yellow-orange pigment, phaeomelanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The eumelanin-to-phaeomelanin ratio determines skin and hair colour in humans and coat colour in other mammals. A connection between MC1R and the red-hair phenotype was first established by Valverde et al in 1995, however, since then, variants of MC1R have been linked to an increased risk for skin cancer, UV damage, photoaging and more recently with increased severity of post-burn hypertrophic scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Several studies have explored the role of the receptor in inflammatory responses, including animal models of arthritis. These works have demonstrated that delivery of an MC1R agonist can dampen immune cell recruitment and/or activation and thus inflammation, which in the case of the arthritic joint can prevent cartilage degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). To date, no studies have explored the role of MC1R in acute and chronic skin wounds, however, Muffley <italic>et al</italic> have described dynamic spatial localisation of MC1R during cutaneous wound repair, including expression by keratinocytes and immune cells in the acute wound bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that MC1R-Ag promotes acute wound angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis whilst accelerating wound closure and reducing scarring. We also provide the first description of a</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MC1R accelerates wound healing with reduced scarring</title><p id="P6">To investigate the role of MC1R in wound repair, we used a model of full-thickness excisional skin injury to the dorsal skin of C57Bl/6J wildtype mice. In agreement with Muffley <italic>et al</italic>, we found that <italic>e</italic>xpression of <italic>mc1r</italic> and endogenous ligand precursor <italic>pomc</italic> was induced in acute wounds, peaking at 1 day post-injury (dpi) and declining to healthy skin levels by 7 dpi in both young (8 w old) and aged (18 m old) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). To investigate the role of MC1R in cutaneous wound repair we used a MC1R selective agonist, BMS-470539 (MC1R-Ag) as the endogenous agonist αMSH is also a ligand for MC3R and MC5R. MC1R-Ag or vehicle control were administered topically to 4mm full-thickness excisional wounds immediately after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Macroscopic analysis revealed accelerated wound closure in MC1R-Ag-treated wounds, with maximum differences at 3 and 7 dpi (Vehicle 7dpi, 16.6 ± 3.8%; MC1R-Ag, 7dpi, 4 ± 2.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B, C</xref>). Key repair parameters were assessed, including epithelial tongue length and scab presence as measures of reepithelialisation. An epidermal tongue is the portion of epidermis that has proliferated and migrated under the scab and was found to be significantly longer at 3 dpi with MC1R-Ag-treatment (Vehicle, 270 ± 19 μm; MC1R-Ag, 399 ± 22 μm <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the dynamic changes in epidermal thickness during wound healing, we demonstrate that harnessing MC1R results in earlier proliferation of wound edge epidermis (peak at 3 dpi vs 5 dpi with vehicle-treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), this was followed by a quicker reduction in epidermal thickness by 7 dpi (Vehicle, 140 ± 8 μm; MC1R-Ag, 93 ± 9 μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). Since re-epithelialisation was completed earlier in MC1R-Ag-treated wounds, this resulted in reduced scab presence at 7 dpi (Vehicle, 71 ± 8.5%; MC1R-Ag, 18 ± 7% of wounds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G,H</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Physiological skin repair culminates in formation of a scar, which predominantly consists of linear bundles of collagen fibers, as opposed to normal dermis, which exhibits a basketweave appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). To quantify scarring we measured collagen fiber orientation using a novel app, FIBRAL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1-2</xref>). Unwounded skin exhibited abundant collagen with largely randomly-oriented fibers corresponding with a low alignment index (0.152 ± 0.024 ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I-K</xref>). In vehicle-treated day 7 wounds, collagen was laid down in a more linear fashion resulting in a high alignment. Wound treatment with MC1R-Ag, however, resulted in collagen deposition with a more random orientation closer to unwounded dermal collagen organisation, which equated to reduced alignment in comparison to vehicle-treated wounds (0.39 ± 0.036 MC1R-Ag vs 0.58 ± 0.045 vehicle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I-K</xref>). We also assessed collagen quantity in Picrosirius Red-stained wound sections, finding that treatment with MC1R-Ag accelerated the rate of collagen deposition (66.9 ± 1.85% MC1R-Ag vs 56.5.2 ± 3.64% vehicle vs unwounded 74.5 ± 6.17%). Thus a downstream consequence of wound MC1R-Ag treatment is reduced scarring through improved collagen deposition quality and quantity to levels approaching unwounded skin.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MC1R modulates the wound environment during healing</title><p id="P8">Wound repair from the late stages of fetal development onwards is accompanied by robust recruitment of innate immune cells to the wound. The optimal balance between sufficient leukocyte recruitment to combat any invading microorganisms versus excessive pathological inflammation, which contributes to scarring, is of critical importance in any tissue repair response or therapeutic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). We monitored leukocyte recruitment dynamics during dermal wound repair, finding that MC1R-Ag administration inhibits neutrophil recruitment to excisional cutaneous wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, MC1R-Ag increased F4/80<sup>+</sup> MΦ recruitment to day 7 wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), however we noted that MΦ distribution in the skin adjacent to the wound was limited by MC1R-Ag treatment, unlike vehicle-treated day 7 wounds where an F4/80<sup>+</sup> infiltrate is present in the wound adjacent dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). We noted no clear change in wound MΦ morphology, however, a marked improvement in erythrocyte clearance (Prussian blue<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) was observed, along with significantly reduced wound TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) and oxidative stress (dihydrorhodamine<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that MC1R agonism modulates the wound microenvironment, possibly resulting in a shift towards the repair phase (proliferation/migration and remodelling).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Harnessing MC1R drives angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis at sites of cutaneous repair</title><p id="P9">Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are processes that principally occur either during early development or during wound repair or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Wound angiogenesis is required to enable delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the metabolically demanding repairing tissue, with impaired angiogenesis observed in aberrant healing scenarios including DFUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Lymphatic vessels are thought to be important in wound healing as they drain interstitial fluid to reduce tissue swelling and permit the transportation of immune cells to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We therefore investigated the effect of MC1R-Ag on angiogenic and lymphangiogenic responses during cutaneous wound repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). As we and others have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), the time course of angiogenesis preceded that of lymphangiogenesis with angiogenic sprouting occurring as early as 3 dpi, peaking at 7 dpi and vascular remodelling, including trimming of superfluous vessels occurring thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The lymphangiogenic response, however, was evident at 7 dpi, and appeared to still be ongoing at our latest time point 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Wound treatment with MC1R-Ag profoundly enhances the angiogenic (155%) and lymphangiogenic (216%) responses with increased vessel density over vehicle-treated wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Vessel width analysis reveals that MC1R-Ag administration results in increased lymphatic vessel width but equivalent blood vessel widths in comparison to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). OCT angiography was performed to verify if the CD31<sup>+</sup> cell areas detected via immunofluorescence staining were functional, perfused blood vessels. Indeed, notable wound bed perfusion is detectable 7 dpi with MC1R-treatment and declines thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). To determine whether MC1R-Ag was improving wound vascularisation via direct MC1R-mediated effects on endothelial cells, we employed a microvascular endothelial cell tube formation assay. MC1R-Ag significantly increased readouts of <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis, including total mesh area, branching interval and total segment area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). MC1R knockdown using siRNA demonstrated that these angiogenic effects of BMS-470539 are mediated by MC1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S5</xref>). To assess wound lymphatic vasculature function, we employed a lymphatic drainage assay, whereby Evans Blue dye injected into wounds was quantified in skin-draining lymph nodes. We confirm that the observed increase in lymphatic vessel area translated to improved lymphatic drainage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Collectively, we demonstrate that BMS-470539 acts via endothelial cell MC1R to drive angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, resulting in improved wound bed blood supply and lymphatic drainage.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lack of functional MC1R impairs acute wound healing</title><p id="P10">In humans and mice, lack of a functional MC1R due to spontaneous mutation, results in preferential production of the yellow-orange pigment, phaeomelanin in the skin and hair. To establish the impact of MC1R on wound healing, we generated 4 mm wounds in MC1Re/e mice, which harbour a non-functional receptor (ginger hair; C57Bl/6J background) and in wildtype (black hair; C57Bl/6J) mice. We discover that lack of functional MC1R profoundly impairs healing, with significantly delayed wound closure detectable at 1, 7, 10 and 14 dpi (7 dpi – MC1Re/e, 27.4 ± 2.1%; C57B/6J, 7.36 ± 0.83% of initial wound area; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). Scab loss, an indicator of complete reepithelialisation, is also delayed with 95% of MC1Re/e wounds retaining a scab at 7 dpi in comparison to 68.8% of wildtype control wounds (MC1Re/e + vehicle, 95 ± 5.1%; MC1Re/e + BMS-470539, 90.2 ± 6.1%; C57Bl/6J, 68.8 ± 7.84; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). MC1R agonist, BMS-470539, is unable to impact the wound healing response in MC1Re/e mice.</p><p id="P11">We have established that harnessing MC1R using a selective agonist, BMS-470539, drives wound bed vascularisation and promotes acute wound repair with reduced scarring. However, acute wounds typically heal without complications, therefore we asked whether MC1R agonism would be of benefit in the context of non-healing wounds.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Development of a preclinical chronic wound model</title><p id="P12">CWs represent a major unmet need and exhibit profoundly impaired wound vascularisation, which is thought to be an important determinant of wound outcome. We reasoned that administration of MC1R-Ag in a preclinical CW model would allow us to determine whether harnessing this pathway holds merit as a novel intervention for pathological healing. To get to this point, we first needed to develop a humane model that reproduces the hallmarks of human CWs, both on a macroscopic level (eg. exudate, slough, wound expansion) and a microscopic level (eg. hyperproliferative epidermis, extravasated erythrocytes, fibrinous exudate, parakeratosis). We specifically sought to develop a model that is broadly relevant across the ulcer categories of VLU, DFU and PU, rather than specifically modelling a certain category. Whilst each type of CW is associated with certain comorbidities, for example PU with conditions causing immobility; at their core they share key features. The overwhelming majority of skin ulcers develop in the over 50s, with 95 percent occurring in the over 60s. In addition, VLU, DFU and PU have been shown to exhibit high levels of wound bed oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Taking inspiration from the advantages and limitations of current murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), we developed our unique model using aged animals and local elevation of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">A 4 mm excisional wound was made to the dorsal skin of aged mice, topical Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) inhibitor, mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) was applied, following by a transparent Tegaderm dressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The wounds expanded into the surrounding tissue 5-fold over the first 7 dpi with the tissue taking on a macerated (white) appearance (approx. 1 dpi), followed by a thin red border appearing around the macerated area at 3 dpi but absent by 7 dpi. The wounds produced exudate and slough, stabilised at this size for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A-B</xref>) and were well tolerated by the animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Wound architecture was compared between the well established acute excisional wound model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-D</xref>), the new CW model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G-H</xref>) and a cohort of 44 human CWs (28 VLU, 9 DFU, 7 PU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). During successful skin repair, at only 1 dpi a scab has formed as a result of haemostasis, reepithelialisation is not evident, provisional matrix has been deposited and a rich PMN infiltrate is notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, at 14 dpi, reepithelialisation is complete, scab loss has occurred, few PMN remain and the wound bed is well vascularised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In human CWs we find that fibrinous exudate, hyperproliferative epidermis, PMN infiltrate and vasculitis are consistently present, being identified in 86-100% of DFU, VLU and PU. Hypogranulosis (78-100%), extravasated erythrocytes (71-100%), parakeratosis (57-78%) and spongiosis (67-100%) were also common histomorphological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Hemosiderin deposition proved to be the most variable feature, found in all VLU, 56% of DFU but none observable in PU.

In our preclinical CW model, macroscopic and histomorphological analysis revealed excellent recapitulation of hallmarks of human CWs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G,H</xref>). Notable, were a severe lack of granulation tissue formation, substantial and persistent fibrinous exudate, presence of extravasated erythrocytes and subcutaneous fat necrosis. Major disturbance to epidermal physiology was evident through hyperproliferation, spongiosis and parakeratosis, along with a complete failure of wound reepithelialisation.

To assess a potential therapeutic intervention, we therefore debrided the wounds 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Topical vehicle-control and MC1R-Ag were administered in a pluronic hydrogel immediately after debridement and at each subsequent dressing change 3 and 5 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Vehicle-treated debrided wounds mimicked the hallmarks of human CWs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B,C</xref>), including extravasated erythrocytes, PMN infiltrate, fibrinous exudate, spongiosis, parakeratosis, a lack of wound vascularisation and absence of reepithelialisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B,C</xref>), whilst exhibiting a partial stimulation to healing, evident as a 30% reduction in wound area at 14 dpi. However, MC1R-Ag treatment following debridement rescued the healing response, with an additional 33% reduction in wound area over debridement alone. Here, we observed partial reepithelialisation, as evidenced by formation of epithelial tongues, minimal fibrinous exudate was present and a vascularised granulation tissue formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B,D</xref>). In contrast, MC1Re/e CWs produced copious wound exudate both pre and post-wound debridement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E,H</xref>) such that 88% exhibited notable exudate 14 dpi in comparison to 56% of vehicle-treated wildtype wounds. Presence of wound exudate was reduced with MC1R-agonist treatment with only 20% of wounds displaying visible exudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F,H</xref>). Importantly, NETosis, spongiosis and hemosiderin deposition were notable features of MC1Re/e CWs, but extravasated erythrocytes were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In this study, we assessed the impact of harnessing MC1R on acute wound healing using a selective agonist, BMS-470539. MC1R agonism resulted in accelerated wound closure and reepithelialisation in wildtype but not MC1Re/e mice which harbour a non-functional receptor. MC1R-Ag improved wound perfusion and lymphatic drainage by promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, reducing local oxidative stress and inflammation with a knock-on effect of reduced scarring. Our data suggest that MC1R enables wounds to transition to the proliferative phase quicker to effect efficient healing. Surprisingly we noted minimal effects on leukocyte recruitment, however, it is entirely possible that some of the impact on wound healing may be through modulating leukocyte phenotype or via leukocyte lineages out with the scope of this study. Nevertheless, MC1R-Ag acts directly on endothelial cells to drive microvascular endothelial cell sprouting and mesh formation and may therefore hold promise for pathologies characterised by poor vascularisation.</p><p id="P17">MC1R activation also has potential anti-fibrotic properties. Collagen alignment plays a significant role in scar quality, with a disordered collagen architecture being characteristic of an unwounded dermis. Using simulations and multi-scale mathematical modelling, McDougall <italic>et al</italic> derived equations to elucidate the molecular cause of alignment during collagen deposition. Their results suggest that a localised chemoattractant gradient, with greater effects on only those fibroblasts in the vicinity of the wound, produces a collagen pattern that is highly disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). This could be the driver behind reduced collagen alignment in MC1R agonist-treated wounds; macrophages were more restricted to the wound site and could thus provide localised chemoattractants. The inflammatory profile at the wound site and in the neighbouring unwounded dermis could be more comprehensively analysed for mediators known to modulate fibroblasts biology, to further elucidate the mechanism of the observed effect of MC1R-Ag on scarring.</p><p id="P18">Given that the majority of acute wounds heal without complication, and CWs represent a profound and escalating burden to individuals and healthcare systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), we sought to develop a preclinical CW model to act as a platform for testing of novel interventions such as MC1R-Ag. Equally importantly, the provision of such a model has long been recognised as essential to better understand the disease process without the risk of clinical harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Here, we utilised the mouse as our model organism, since they are amenable to genetic manipulation, reproduce rapidly and are easy to house and maintain.</p><p id="P19">As described by Frykberg and Banks, CWs have variable underlying pathologies, including diabetes, immobility, venous stasis and can be divided into categories based on these, such as DFU, PU and VLU. However, almost all CWs occur in the over 50s and exhibit elevated oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Whilst CWs also typically exhibit pathological alterations in the balance of various MMPs and TIMPs, manipulation of these pathways is not trivial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We therefore developed our model by combining advanced age and locally elevated oxidative stress, which proved to accurately mimic many of the hallmarks of human CWs. The model can now be used to study CW development and persistence with the view of identifying novel tractable targets for therapeutic gain.</p><p id="P20">Inevitably, every preclinical model has limitations and it is important to be aware of these, particularly when translating findings to the clinic. With respect to the preclinical CW model we have described here, the key considerations are concerning the unavoidable differences in skin anatomy between mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In human, the epidermis and dermis are thicker and the skin is firmly adherent to the fascia, whereas in mouse, the skin is typically not adherent to the underlying fascia. We note that in our model and the context of chronic inflammation, the wounds can adhere to the fascia. Indeed, others have noted a major contribution of fascia-derived fibroblasts to murine acute wound scarring, though in this scenario the wound is only temporarily adherent to fascia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Here, we deliberately avoided generating a diabetic chronic wound model, conscious of the need for a model broadly applicable to all categories of human CWs and to the limitations of murine diabetes models, which are typically monogenic and include leptin abnormalities, unlike human type 2 diabetes, which is polygenic, multifactorial and absent in leptin aberrations. In addition, the duration of human CWs has always posed a challenge with respect to preclinical model development. It is simply not ethical nor feasible, due to the short lifespan of mice, to model CWs that persist for many years as they can in human. Instead, we model the development and shorter-term persistence of CWs in our murine model, consciously choosing time points that provide a comparison to the well-published acute wound model. In doing so, we provide the opportunity We are however encouraged by our histomorphological analysis, which revealed many of the same features of human CW epidermis, including clear epithelial hyperproliferation, failure to reepithelialise and parakeratosis.</p><p id="P21">The cellular and molecular mechanisms behind skin repair and scar formation and particularly development and persistence of CWs have yet to be fully elucidated, this study suggests that targeting MC1R may represent an effective strategy to rescue failed healing and reduce acute wound scarring, potentially by enabling wounds to transition to the proliferative phase quicker. We anticipate that our novel model will become a valuable tool to interrogate ulcer formation and persistence along with testing of novel interventions, whilst the discovery of MC1R agonists role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of this pathway for wound healing.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>BMS-470539</title><p id="P22">MC1R agonist, BMS-470539, was synthesised by Mimotopes (Minneapolis, USA), reconstituted (1 mM in PBS + 0.1% BSA) and stored at -80°C for up to 6 months.

To undertake this, we developed a MATLAB code which first isolated collagen fibrils from non-fibrous tissue using a colour-based segmentation algorithm. First, the user selected image is converted from an RGB image to a two-dimensional matrix of type <italic>m</italic> × <italic>n</italic> × 3. Where <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> represent the row and column indices respectively. Our code (which we name FIBRAL) converts the image colour space from RGB to L*a*b to more accurately predict small colour differences, key for PSR staining in which small variation detection is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Both the full a-channel and positive range of the b-channel were isolated and superimposed. This new matrix was transformed into grayscale with contrast and brightness increased by 20% and 5% respectively.</p><p id="P36">To determine the spatial distribution of collagen fibres, a two-dimensional Fourier transformation was performed on the image. This data was transformed from cartesian to polar coordinates by grouping predominant frequency-component orientations of the fibres in 1-degree increments from 0 to 180 degrees. The total intensity at each angle was calculated by summing the grayscale intensity values of each pixel contained within the group. Large intensity values represented the summation of multiple sinusoidal waves with large amplitude signifying major fibre alignment along the respective orientation. From this data, a comparative analysis can be conducted whereby the dot product was calculated using each permutation of resulting vectors (parallel vectors would provide a dot product of 1, with orthogonal vectors presenting a dot product value of -1). All results were normalised to lie between 0 and 1 with a directionality quotient of 1 representing a parallel field of fibres and a directionality quotient of 0 representing full fibre orientation across all angles in the tissue. The code was validated against images with dominant fibre orientations and combinations thereof.
