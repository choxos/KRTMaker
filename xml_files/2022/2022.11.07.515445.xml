Assisted by a network of citizen scientists across the United Kingdom, we show that 1 in 20 viable aerosolized spores of this mold are resistant to the agricultural fungicide tebuconazole and 1 in 140 spores are resistant to the four most used azoles for treating clinical aspergillosis infections. Season and proximity to industrial composters were associated with growth of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> from air samples, but not with the presence of azole resistance, and hotspots were not stable between sampling periods suggesting a high degree of atmospheric mixing. Genomic analysis shows no distinction between those resistant genotypes found in the environment and in patients, indicating that ~40% (58/150 sequenced genomes) of azole-resistant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> infections are acquired from environmental exposures. Due to the ubiquity of this measured exposure, it is crucial that we determine source(s) of azole-resistant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>, who is at greatest risk of exposure and how to mitigate these exposures, in order to minimize treatment failure in patients with aspergillosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The cosmopolitan mold, <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, causes a spectrum of chronic and acute life-threatening diseases in humans. The widespread occurrence of resistance to first line clinical azole drugs in environmental isolates, alongside molecular epidemiology linking azole-resistant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> (<italic>ARAf</italic>) sourced from patients and the environment, argues that a substantial burden of treatment failure is due to environmental azole exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The numbers of patients in the United Kingdom (UK) presenting with infections that are resistant to one or more of the clinical azoles is increasing in diverse patient groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The significantly elevated case fatality rates where invasive aspergillosis is caused by AR<italic>Af</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) further highlights the importance and breadth of this emerging problem.</p><p id="P3">The widespread use of broad-spectrum agricultural fungicides, founded on the same demethylase inhibitor (DMI) chemistry as the clinical azoles, has long been argued to drive the evolution of environmental resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This hypothesis has found broad support from surveillance demonstrating environmental hotspots of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> growth alongside high frequencies of resistance where this saprotrophic mold has the potential to grow in the presence of agricultural DMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Yet, despite its increasingly wide detection in the environment worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), little is known about the extent to which humans are exposed to <italic>ARAf</italic>. The mold is adapted to airborne dispersal and most humans inhale large numbers of viable spores every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Owing to the potential clinical consequences of their inhalation, occupational exposures to these spores are legislated in countries such as the UK, especially in green-waste recycling and composting processes that have the potential to generate high levels of inocula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, occupational monitoring does not include assessing exposures to AR<italic>Af</italic>. Surveillance has shown hotspots of environmental resistance in environments including both home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and industrial compost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), urban environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), greenhouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and horticultural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Nonetheless, there is little insight into population-wide exposures of at-risk individuals to aerosolised AR<italic>Af</italic> occurring beyond these heterogeneous environmental foci.</p><p id="P4">Given the dynamic nature of the atmosphere and the potential for season to affect the biology of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> spore production, meaningful assessment of human exposure to AR<italic>Af</italic> needs to be undertaken at a population level in a cost-effective manner that spans yearly seasonal variation. To meet this need, a UK-wide campaign was launched using social media, and used to recruit a network of citizen scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These individuals then used simple passive air samplers to collect airborne spores of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> synchronously across a 6–10-hour time period on the days matching the northern hemisphere seasonal equinoxes and solstices between 2018 and 2019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). This activity resulted in a total of 1,894 air samples being collected that, whilst being clustered owing to greater sample collection in areas of high population density, achieved a near UK-wide distribution at each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). These air samples were incubated on growth media using the highly selective temperature of 43°C and 919 (49%) yielded a combined 2,366 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> colonies. Of these, secondary screening on media containing 6 mg/L of the commonly-used agricultural fungicide tebuconazole (TEB; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)) identified 111 TEB-resistant isolates, comprising 4.7 % of the total isolates recovered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This frequency is similar to that (~4%) measured at the Rothamsted Research station in 2016 suggesting an incidence that is relatively stable across recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Of the TEB-resistant isolates, 12 failed to sequence using the <italic>cyp51A</italic> promoter and coding region primers and were re-identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as the related species <italic>Aspergillus lentulus</italic> (<italic>n =</italic> 10) and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 2). For the 99 TEB-resistant isolates confirmed to be <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>, clinical breakpoints then showed that 85 (86%) were resistant to itraconazole (ITZ), the first-line clinical drug for chronic infections, 63 (64%) were resistant to voriconazole (VCZ), the first-line agent for invasive infections, 18 (18%) were resistant to posaconazole (PCZ) and 82 (83%) were resistant to isavuconazole (ISZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of note, 50 (51%) of AR<italic>Af</italic> were resistant to three medical azoles and 14 (14%) were resistant to all tested medical azoles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), identifying a UK-wide aerosolized exposure to drug-resistant variants of this pathogen.</p><p id="P5">In order to examine the genetic basis of the TEB-resistant phenotype, we genotyped the canonical locus that confers azole-resistance, the sterol-demethylase gene <italic>cyp51A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Environmental azole resistance in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> is most commonly due to within-gene point mutations in <italic>cyp51A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) that are twinned with expression-upregulating tandem repeats (TRs) in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Genotyping confirmed that the most common aerosolized resistance-associated polymorphisms were TR34/L98H (59%) and TR46/Y121F/T289A (6%). We further found that 30% of TEB-resistant isolates did not contain any polymorphisms in the <italic>cyp51A</italic> promoter or coding regions suggesting the existence of alternative resistance mechanisms as have previously been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This is of concern in the clinical setting as only the two former mutations are picked up by commercially available PCR diagnostic methods, although previously unidentified mutations leading to resistance will be picked up by phenotypic testing of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) providing that there is an isolate available to test.</p><p id="P6">Subsequently, we determined the extent to which aerosolized AR<italic>Af</italic> matched those previously recovered and sequenced from the UK terrestrial environments and patient cohorts by sequencing the genomes of 62 AR<italic>Af</italic> isolates from the summer 2018 air sampling round (21 wild-type; 41 TEB-resistant). These data were then combined with those resulting from prior UK-wide genomic surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) in a phylogenetic analysis. The resulting tree showed that aerosolized isolates were broadly distributed throughout the UK phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and were drawn from both previously described clades <italic>A</italic> (which contains the majority of AR<italic>Af</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)) and ‘<italic>B</italic>’ (which is mainly sensitive to asignificant effect on whetherzole fungicides). Principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) corroborated our conclusion that there was no clear differentiation between aerosolized isolates when compared to those from clinical and terrestrial sources, and nucleotide diversity (π) tests showed that the observed genetic diversity separating these groups was not significantly different (one-tailed t-test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.12591). We did, however, note two clusters of aerosolized isolates that were largely unrepresented in our previous surveillance, suggesting a temporally dynamic aspect to the UK population genetic structure of this fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). When mapped against the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> reference genome <italic>Af293</italic>, each pair of isolates across the combined dataset were, on average, separated by 24,000 SNPs, a figure that was marginally lower (23,250 SNPs) when considering only aerosolized isolates. Significantly, the genotype of an aerially sourced AR<italic>Af</italic> isolate grouped within a previously identified UK-wide clonal subclade of genotypes, Clade A<italic>A</italic>. Isolates in this clade all bear the hallmark TR34/L98H resistance allele and are widely found in the environment and infecting patients. From these genomic data, we concluded that the genotypes of AR<italic>Af</italic> recovered from the UK aerobiome are largely (but not exclusively) representative of those azole-resistant genotypes recovered from patients. Moreover, these data indicate that ~40% (58/150 sequenced genomes) of AR<italic>Af</italic> infections are acquired from environmental exposures.</p><p id="P7">We next sought to explain the spatial occurrence of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> and AR<italic>Af</italic> using logistic regression to determine which cardinal environmental variables (season, maximum daily temperature, land cover classification and proximity to nearest industrial composting facility with open windrow or outdoor activity (OW/OA)) affected their likelihood. Individually, each variable was found to have a significant effect on whether a sample grew the mold (season χ<sup>2</sup> = 50.3, df = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; maximum daily temperature χ<sup>2</sup> = 29.3, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; land cover classification χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.4, df = 7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; proximity to nearest OW/OA composting facility χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.1, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Negative binomial regression then determined which environmental variables affected the number of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> colonies grown, with sampling round (χ<sup>2</sup> = 35.9, df = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and proximity of sampling location to the nearest OW/OA composting facility (χ<sup>2</sup> = 10.2, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) showing significant associations. Subsequently, Average Nearest Neighbour (ANN) tests found sampling locations in each sampling round to be clustered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) and Getis-Ord Gi* spatial clustering analysis detected hotspots (high-) and coldspots (low-prevalence) of airborne AR<italic>Af</italic> in each sampling round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-H</xref>). However, none of the included environmental variables were found to affect the number of AR<italic>Af</italic> grown from the air-samples, and the detected clusters were not stable between sampling rounds.</p><p id="P8">In parallel to our aerosol sampling, a soil-sampling campaign was conducted by citizen scientists during the 2019 summer solstice, resulting in the recovery of a high burden of AR<italic>Af</italic> from garden soils totaling 736 (14%) resistant isolates from 246 locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). There were 46 participants from which both soil and at least one air sample were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Of these, 23 (50%) grew AR<italic>Af</italic> colonies from either an air sample or soil sample, but only 3 (7%) grew AR<italic>Af</italic> colonies from both. Moreover, there were no locations from which AR<italic>Af</italic> was isolated from an air sample more than once. Taken together, these observations lead us to conclude that the locally dynamic nature of atmospheric flows means that our bioaerosol sampling strategy does not capture the presence of local AR<italic>Af</italic> soil hotspots. The corollary of this observation is that atmospheric mixing leads to the UK population being, on average, equally exposed to this bioaerosol. Based on our air sampling data and this assumption, we estimate that the cumulative exposure of each individual across the UK to AR<italic>Af</italic> averages 22 (95% CI: 6-38) days per year.</p><p id="P9">Importantly, while our study only reports on aerosolized spores collected in the UK, this exposure is not restricted to the UK. Recruitment of citizen scientists attracted several participants from outside the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) with air samples from Germany, France and The Netherlands growing viable AR<italic>Af</italic>. Fungal spores are readily dispersed across intercontinental scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), and our population genetic studies of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> has shown that its worldwide distribution is unstructured, with no evidence for isolation-by-distance effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Moreover, the usage of DMIs in agriculture is widely increasing where measured (e.g., ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)), and environmental azole-resistance has been detected in every country in which it was monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) indicating that AR<italic>Af</italic> has achieved a global occurrence. Yet, to date, there has been no attempt to systematically measure population-wide exposures to AR<italic>Af</italic> more globally. This is changing, and in 2022 the pan-South American LatAsp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.latasp.com">https://www.latasp.com</ext-link>) surveillance study commenced, mirroring the essential features of our Citizen Science campaign, with the aim of determining the continent-wide incidence of AR<italic>Af</italic>. Nonetheless, identifying the ecological hotspots that ultimately cause the miasma of azole-adapted mould that we document will require spatially downscaled approaches if they are to be mitigated.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title><italic>Culturing</italic> Aspergillus fumigatus <italic>from UK air samples</italic></title><p id="P10">Air samples from which <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> isolates were cultured for this study were collected in four sampling rounds of a citizen science project that took place between June 2018 and March 2019.

Growth of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> or AR<italic>Af</italic><sup>-</sup> from a sample was categorized as 0/1 and logistic regressions (“glm” function; family = “binomial”) were performed. Significant improvement on the null model, as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using chi-squared test, determined which environmental variables were included in the regression model. Reduced Akaike information criterion (AIC) score and significant improvement on the null model were used to choose the regression model with the best fit. Results were considered significant when p &lt;= 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Spatial clustering analysis</title><p id="P22">ArcMap 10.7 was used to investigate the spatial distribution of all sampling locations and the samples that grew AR<italic>Af</italic>. Sample locations were georeferenced and projected using the British National Grid (EPSG:27700) coordinate reference system.</p><p id="P23">The Average Nearest Neighbour (ANN) test was used to determine whether the sampling locations in each sampling round, and across all sampling rounds, were randomly distributed or spatially autocorrelated. This test measures the distance between each sampling location and the next closest sampling location and compares this to the distance that would be expected if the locations were randomly distributed throughout the study area (the UK). If the observed mean distance is less than the expected mean distance, the spatial distribution of the observed data is considered spatially clustered. Alternatively, if the mean distance is greater than the expected distribution, the features are considered dispersed. In both scenarios, ANN ratios were used to establish the type of spatial pattern (<italic>i.e</italic>. clustered, dispersed or random) and associated p values &lt;0.05 were used to establish statistical significance.</p><p id="P24">A local indicator of spatial autocorrelation was used to detect and geographically identify hotspots of azole resistance in the UK. First, sampling locations were geospatially aggregated within a gridded hexagon structure (cell area 115km<sup>2</sup>). For each cell, the total number of collected samples and the total number of azole-resistant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> samples were extracted and used to calculate sample positivity (%). Cells with zero sample locations were removed prior to analysis. Then, a Getis Ord Gi* analysis was conducted to identify statistically significant hotspot cells based on sample positivity. This approach was used to generate local z scores for each cell, with statistically significant high and low values indicating hotspots and coldspots, respectively. For this analysis hot- and coldspot cells were generated and grouped using three different significance values (90, 95 and 99%).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Average exposure simulation analysis</title><p id="P25">Assuming that any location could potentially be AR<italic>Af</italic> positive at some point in time, we conducted a simulation based on 1,000,000 individuals, each having a respiratory rate extracted from a normal distribution with a mean of 9L/min and a standard deviation of 2L/min. To match the air sampling campaigns conducted, we considered 1,095 time periods of 8 hours over a period of one year (365 days). The probability of each individual being exposed to AR<italic>Af</italic> was based on a truncated normal distribution of mean 5.86% and standard deviation of 2.80%, set with 0 as the lower bound.
