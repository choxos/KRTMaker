Here we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multi-channel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing non-invasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain-body communication in its entirety in health and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The spinal cord is an important interface for reciprocal brain-body communication in sensory, motor and autonomic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Traditionally, it has been portrayed as a relay station, yet recent studies challenge this long-held view, for example in the somatosensory domain, where a high degree of neuronal complexity and circuit organization has been delineated in animal models, suggestive of extensive integrative processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Such advances are important in order to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of spinal processing, especially considering the spinal cord’s central role in numerous neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] as well as in treatment approaches for spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] or biomarker development for analgesic drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. While there is a continuous development of sophisticated spinal recording technologies in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], such progress is missing in human neuroscience and knowledge on processing in the human spinal cord is consequently very limited, thus presenting a missing link in a comprehensive understanding of brain-body communication in health and disease.</p><p id="P3">Approaches such as reflex recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] allow for useful assessments of the processes occurring within the human spinal cord, yet they only provide an indirect picture and more direct assessments via neuroimaging techniques are highly desirable. Several factors make the spinal cord a very challenging target for non-invasive neuroimaging however: it has a small diameter, is located deep in the body in close proximity to inner organs such as the heart and lungs, and is protected by the vertebral column and muscle layers. Consequently, there is a lack of well-established and readily-available approaches to interrogate human spinal cord function. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] comes with major technical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and is fundamentally limited by its indirect link to neuronal activity via neurovascular coupling and ensuing low temporal resolution. Magnetospinography (MSG) on the other hand is a non-invasive method that directly measures the magnetic fields generated by neuronal populations in the spinal cord with high temporal precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], yet no commercially available systems have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Both approaches are therefore only pursued by a small number of research groups and additionally require major investments in large-scale equipment, preventing their widespread use in human neuroscience.</p><p id="P4">Here, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes these issues. It is based on an enhancement of methodology established several decades ago during the development of non-invasive electrospinography (ESG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. These studies recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from the human spinal cord via surface electrodes placed on the skin over the vertebral column and reported SEPs with a post-synaptic origin in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. While useful in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], due to technical challenges this line of research has however largely subsided in experimental neuroscience, with only a handful of studies recording such spinal SEPs non-invasively in healthy human volunteers in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. To improve upon these approaches and expand the insights ESG can offer, we leveraged the developments that have occurred in recording capabilities and processing techniques for neurophysiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]: we developed a non-invasive approach that allows for recording spinal signals with high temporal precision (10 kHz) as well as extensive spatial coverage (multi-channel montage of 39 surface electrodes placed over the neck and trunk in two dense electrode grids) and combined this with concurrent recordings of the input to (peripheral nerve action potentials, NAPs) and output from the spinal cord (brainstem and cortical SEPs). Furthermore, we developed dedicated artifact-correction techniques to enhance the spinal signal-to-noise ratio and employed multivariate analysis approaches that allowed for increased robustness as well as extraction of spinal cord responses at single-trial level.</p><p id="P5">This approach thus provides a direct and easily-accessible electrophysiological window into a previously missing link of brain-body communication relevant for several domains in human neuroscience. Here, we chose the domain of somatosensation as test-bed and employed this approach in two complementary studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), in both of which we recorded signals from the cervical and lumbar spinal cord, in order to allow for the generalization of our findings across upper and lower limb representations. Most importantly, this approach allowed us to directly investigate whether integrative processes already occur at the level of the human spinal cord, i.e. at the first station of central nervous system processing. In a final proof-of-principle experiment, we furthermore assess the possibility of using this non-invasive approach to detect nociceptive spinal cord responses in humans.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Delineating somatosensory responses along the neural hierarchy (Experiment 1)</title><p id="P6">As a first objective, we aimed to replicate previously-reported somatosensory responses along the neural hierarchy, with a special focus on the spinal cord and thus simultaneously recorded peripheral NAPs as well as SEPs from the spinal cord, brainstem and cortex to upper and lower limb stimulation. In the hand-mixed condition, we extracted the peripheral N6 (origin: median nerve), the peripheral N9 (origin: brachial plexus), the spinal N13 (origin: dorsal horn), the brainstem N14 (likely origin: cuneate nucleus) and the cortical N20 (origin: primary somatosensory cortex). In the foot-mixed condition, we extracted the peripheral N8 (origin: tibial nerve), the spinal N22 (origin: dorsal horn), the brainstem N30 (likely origin: gracile nucleus) and the cortical P40 (origin: primary somatosensory cortex).</p><p id="P7">Replication was successful at all recording sites, where we observed response amplitudes that were highly significant at the group level (N = 36) and exhibited consistently large effect sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>); to furthermore ensure the robustness of these results, we replicated them in Experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Grand-average time-courses at the group-level are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and delineate the temporal progression of the neurophysiological signal along the processing hierarchy, providing a robust and comprehensive view on somatosensory processing from periphery to cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterizing spinal SEPs in detail (Experiment 1)</title><p id="P8">Next, we aimed to provide a spatial, temporal and spectral characterization of spinal responses. First, the grand-average time-course of the potentials obtained from single, anatomically-defined target electrodes exhibited a tri-phasic shape with an initial positive deflection, a main negative deflection (at 13ms and 24ms, respectively) and a slowly decaying late positive deflection (red trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Second, our multi-channel set-up allowed for the first time to estimate the potentials’ spatial topography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>), which showed a radial dipole at peak latency, with a centre over the spinal cord, close to the spinal segments targeted by the electrical stimulation at wrist and ankle. Importantly, the topographies show that N13 and N22 responses are consistently limited to the relevant electrode-grid (cervical for upper-limb and lumbar for lower limb stimulation), with no evidence for responses in the irrelevant electrode grid, thus presenting a spatial double-dissociation. Third, grand-average time-frequency plots delineated responses with a frequency between ~50-320 Hz at the cervical and between ~50-250 Hz at the lumbar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>), demonstrating the fast nature of these potentials.</p><p id="P9">Considering recent findings on the complexity of somatosensory processing in the dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], we then went beyond the classical spinal SEPs and assessed whether we could detect responses that occur later than the early N13 or N22 components. Using a cluster-based permutation approach, we did indeed find statistical evidence for such late components: we identified a positive cervical cluster directly after the N13 component (17-35ms, p = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and two lumbar clusters after the N22 (positive: 28-35ms, p = 0.002; negative: 126-132ms, p = 0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>); two out of these three late potentials did also replicate in the independent sample from Experiment 2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>). Taken together, these results provide a comprehensive characterization of spinal SEPs, including responses that occur beyond the initial processing sweep in the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Enhancing sensitivity via multivariate spatial filtering (Experiment 1)</title><p id="P10">A main aim of our approach was to enhance the sensitivity for detecting spinal cord SEPs via a multi-channel setup and corresponding multivariate spatial filtering analyses, which provide two important benefits. First, multivariate spatial filtering approaches are able to enhance the SNR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], which is critically important in scenarios such as the low SNR spinal recordings carried out here. Second, by reweighting the multi-channel signal on a participant-specific basis, they are able to account for between-participant differences of anatomy and physiology. This point is especially relevant in the spinal cord, where our results demonstrate that already at the group-level the anatomically-defined target channel (red dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B and F</xref>) does not necessarily capture the strongest deflection of the cervical N13 (slight rostral shift) or the lumbar N22 (slight caudal shift). With individual spatial shifts being even stronger, this indicates a necessity of having a grid of electrodes and correspondingly tailored analyses in order to be able to account for heterogeneity in source location and orientation.</p><p id="P11">We applied a variant of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to the preprocessed data of the cervical or lumbar ESG grid, which is a multivariate method that takes information from all sensors of interest into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. By finding participant-specific spatial filters that maximize the correlation between two multivariate datasets (here: single SEP trials and the trial-averaged SEP), it computes multiple orthogonal projections, of which we selected the strongest one with a temporal peak at the expected latency and a corresponding spatial pattern with the expected dipole orientation. The resulting group-level cervical N13 and lumbar N22 were similar in shape and latency but clearly exceeded the noise level compared to the single-electrode signal (black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>), also resulting in a significantly higher SNR (more than two-fold increase in lumbar data; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4E</xref>), with a large majority of participants showing increased SNR after CCA. Most importantly, the CCA-induced SNR enhancement of the evoked responses allowed for the extraction of cervical and lumbar SEPs at the single-trial level in all participants: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-D and 4F-H</xref> shows single-participant SEPs at the single-trial level, comparing the CCA projected data (right subpanels) with single-electrode data (left subpanels), clearly demonstrating the increase in signal-to-noise level in CCA-cleaned data. This indicates that taking the information from many channels into account provides a fundamental sensitivity increase for detecting even very weak – i.e. trial-wise – spinal responses.</p><p id="P12">Furthermore, in order to demonstrate that CCA is not creating artefactual signal due to overfitting, we carried out a control analysis. More specifically, in each participant we i) trained CCA on a random selection of 50% of the trials (underlying data: band-pass filtered, anterior-electrode re-referenced, epoched; time windows: 8-18ms for median and 14.5-29.5 for tibial nerve stimulation;), ii) saved the time-course of the first component, iii) repeated this procedure a thousand times and iv) then calculated all pair-wise absolute correlations between the obtained component time-courses (in the CCA training time-window). This procedure was also carried out on resting-state data, using identical trial timings. At the group level, we then compared the correlation strength between task-based data and resting-state data via a paired t-test. The main idea of this procedure was to demonstrate that correlations between subsampled CCA components would be substantially stronger in the presence of repeated evoked responses compared to CCA performed on the data from the resting-state data where we do not expect repeated evoked responses. For median nerve stimulation, we obtained a group-average absolute correlation of 0.98 (range across participants: 0.76 – 1) in the task-based data and a group-average absolute correlation of 0.58 (range across participants: 0.46 – 0.73) in the resting-state data; for tibial nerve stimulation, the respective values were 0.96 (range: 0.61 – 1) for task and 0.50 (range: 0.37 – 0.68) for rest. Importantly, component correlations were significantly higher in task-based data than in resting-state data (median nerve stimulation: t = 27.80, p &lt; 9.5e-26; tibial nerve stimulation: t = 25.06, p &lt; 3.1e-24; one-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Detecting spinal SEPs to sensory nerve stimulation (Experiment 2)</title><p id="P13">Electrical mixed nerve stimulation at the wrist or ankle – as employed in Experiment 1 – produces the strongest SEPs in the somatosensory system, but is not an ecologically valid type of stimulation (e.g., due to antidromic conduction). To get one step closer towards natural stimulation, in Experiment 2 we additionally stimulated purely sensory nerve fibers of the fingers and toes (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Using this more specific type of stimulation, we did indeed observe clear spinal SEPs, though now with an increased latency (4.3 and 7.6 ms delay for upper and lower limb stimulation, respectively) and reduced amplitude (approximately two-thirds for both upper and lower limb stimulation) compared to mixed nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Such a pattern of results was similarly observed in peripheral NAPs and cortical SEPs for both finger and toe stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and was also confirmed statistically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Similar to the above-reported mixed nerve results, applying CCA to spinal data resulted in an enhancement of sensory nerve SNR, allowing us to study characteristics of those responses as detailed in the following sections.</p><p id="P14">A first such example concerned a trial-by-trial investigation of our data (based on fitting linear-mixed-effects models), assessing whether changes in response amplitude across the processing hierarchy (from peripheral over spinal to cortical levels) would be fully explained by the stimulation condition or whether additional predictive links between the hierarchical levels would be detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>). In brief, we observed that the effects of different stimulation types propagated through the somatosensory processing hierarchy, jointly affecting the amplitudes of peripheral NAPs, spinal cord responses, and initial cortical potentials. Interestingly however, in the foot stimulation condition, additional condition-independent effects of spinal amplitudes on cortical amplitudes were observed, providing first evidence for a trial-by-trial spino-cortical link.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Probing integrative processing along the somatosensory hierarchy (Experiment 2)</title><p id="P15">Finally, we aimed to study a well-known phenomenon of integration in sensory processing, namely attenuation or gating effects, which are for example observed when stimulating two adjacent fingers: a neuronal response following simultaneous stimulation of both fingers is attenuated compared to the sum of neuronal responses to single finger stimulation. This effect of integrative processing is well studied at the cortical level and has been hypothesized to occur subcortically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], yet unequivocal evidence for such integration occurring already at the spinal level is currently lacking. Therefore, we investigated attenuation effects along the processing hierarchy (i.e. at peripheral, spinal and cortical levels) and expected i) that peripheral NAPs would not show attenuation effects (considering that there are no synaptic relays yet), ii) that cortical SEPs would show such effects (replicating previous observations) and, most importantly, iii) that the enhanced sensitivity offered by our multi-channel spatial filtering approach would allow for uncovering such effects already at the spinal level.</p><p id="P16">We therefore obtained CCA-extracted amplitudes of cortical and spinal SEPs as well as peripheral NAPs to single-digit and simultaneous digit stimulation. CCA training and component selection was based on mixed nerve data (which have a higher SNR than sensory nerve data) and the chosen spatial filter was then applied to all sensory nerve conditions, ensuring independence of selection and testing. Using these unbiased amplitudes, we assessed the attenuation effect via interaction-ratios (IR): the IR is a measure that quantifies the amplitude reduction of the simultaneous digit stimulation compared to the arithmetic sum of the single-digit stimulations for each participant. Consistent across both upper and lower limb conditions, we obtained clear evidence for attenuation effects not only at the cortical (N20 and P40), but also at the spinal level (N13 and N22); importantly, such effects were not evident at the peripheral level (N6 and N8; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). While cortical effect sizes of attenuation effects were strongest, spinal effect sizes were already substantial, i.e. in the medium to large range (Cohen’s d of 0.5 for lower limb and 1.1 for upper limb). Taken together, our results indicate that robust attenuation effects in somatosensation are not an exclusively cortical phenomenon, but already occur at the level of the spinal cord, i.e. after the first synaptic relay.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Providing a resource for future experiments (Experiments 1 and 2)</title><p id="P17">Looking ahead, we also aimed to provide a resource for the planning of future experiments by establishing the robustness of the obtained spinal responses. Towards this end, we investigated how many trials are needed to obtain peak amplitudes significantly different from zero at the single-participant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-H</xref>; left panels) and determined the joint minimal number of trials and participants needed for a significant effect at the group-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-H</xref>; right panels) using resampling approaches.</p><p id="P18">The most immediately apparent effect is that no matter which outcome is considered, there is a clear order in the level of robustness across the different stimulation conditions, with mixed nerve stimulation giving more robust results than sensory nerve double-stimulation, which in turn leads to more robust potentials than sensory nerve single-stimulation. Thus, whereas in the mixed nerve condition with one target channel, one is almost guaranteed to obtain a significant group-level effect with e.g., ~10 participants and ~200 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>), many more trials and / or participants would be required in the latter conditions to obtain a significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-H</xref>). Despite this overarching trend, there is however also clear inter-individual variability in responses (cf. participant #1 and participant #13 in the hand-mixed condition, where approximately 100 vs 1000 trials were necessary to obtain a significant result in a majority of repetitions).</p><p id="P19">Another effect that is clearly visible is the beneficial effect of the CCA approach on the robustness of spinal SEPs: in contrast to employing an anatomically-defined target channel, employing CCA required smaller numbers of trials to obtain significant results for each participant in a consistent manner (but note that CCA was trained on the entire mixed-nerve data). While this is already visible at the individual-participant and group-level in the mixed nerve conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>), it becomes even more apparent in the more SNR-limited sensory nerve conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-H</xref>). For instance, for single-digit stimulation of the index finger and an anatomically defined target channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>), the use of 24 participants and 1000 trials was necessary to obtain a significant group-averaged result with a probability of 0.8. In contrast, with the use of CCA (trained on 2000 trials of mixed-nerve data), either the same number of participants with only ~200 trials or 15 participants with ~500 trials were already enough to achieve similar results. These results thus allow researchers to make an informed decision on how to set up future experiments in terms of within- and across-participant factors.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Recording of nociceptive spinal cord responses (Experiment 3)</title><p id="P20">In a final proof-of-principle experiment (N=7), we aimed to provide an example of the usability of this approach by recording spinal cord – and simultaneously also cortical – responses to nociceptive heat-pain stimulation (induced via a CO<sub>2</sub>-laser). At the group level, we observed the canonical laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), i.e. the cortical N1 and N2P2 components, with the expected latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a</xref>). Most importantly, we also observed a distinct LEP at the spinal level, consisting of a negative deflection at 52ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8b</xref>). This response could only be obtained by making use of our multi-channel set-up and spatial filtering approach, since it could not be detected in single electrode signals. Notably, this group-level response was consistent across data splits (four-fold split depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c</xref>) and observed – with slight latency jitter – in every single participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Here, we report the development of a multi-channel electrophysiology approach to non-invasively record spinal cord responses with high precision and sensitivity, incorporating these responses within a comprehensive picture of processing along the somatosensory hierarchy (from peripheral nerves to somatosensory cortex). Across two separate experiments, we provide generalizable results by assessing spatiotemporal response properties in both the cervical and lumbar spinal cord, i.e. the targets of upper and lower limb projections. A central aspect of our approach concerns a reliable extraction and identification of spinal responses in a multivariate way, that is, reweighting the multi-channel signal on a participant-by-participant basis using CCA, which enables single-trial estimation of spinal cord SEPs. In order to allow researchers from various fields to seamlessly build upon our results, we make all data as well as analysis code openly available and also carry out replication and robustness analyses, hoping to provide a status quo of what is currently feasible with multi-channel electrospinography.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Detailed characterization of spinal cord potentials</title><p id="P22">Spinal cord SEPs have been studied intensively in the last century, starting with their discovery in humans in an invasive study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and followed by non-invasive recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].

This comprehensive recording set-up allowed us to embed spinal responses within the temporal progression of the neurophysiological signal along the entire somatosensory processing hierarchy. <italic>Second</italic>, we compared spinal SEPs following sensory nerve stimulation to those following mixed nerve stimulation and observed reduced peak amplitudes and increased latencies, likely due to the lower number of activated fibers and the additional travelling-distance of nerve impulses, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Reassuringly, even with single-digit stimulation (where only approximately 2000-5000 nerve fibres can be expected to be activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]), we observed mostly large effect sizes, hinting at the potential of our ESG approach to also record responses to ecologically more valid stimulation such as touch, which would be expected to have an even lower SNR. <italic>Third</italic>, we made use of our multi-channel setup to investigate the spatial distribution of cervical and lumbar SEPs: both presented as radial dipoles, slightly above the spinous process of vertebra C6 for the N13 and slightly below the spinous process of vertebra L1 for the N22 and with a sagittal center over the cord, speaking against a myogenic origin (which would be expected to result in a more lateralized distribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Importantly, our results show a high degree of anatomical plausibility, not only by being centred close to the spinal segment of interest, but also by showing a spatial double-dissociation: the upper-limb N13 is clearly localized in cervical but not lumbar areas and the lower-limb N22 is clearly localized in lumbar but not cervical areas. To our knowledge, such a spatial characterization of spinal SEPs is unique, as even modern MSG-studies are limited to much smaller spatial windows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] (for ESG, see[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]) and would thus not allow for such insights.

Similar late spinal potentials had been descriptively mentioned as part of a tri-phasic wave in some of the earliest invasive and non-invasive spinal recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], but here we provide firm statistical evidence for their existence at the group-level for the first time. With respect to the origin of these late potentials, a myogenic source has been ruled out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] and a contribution from late top-down brainstem potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] is unlikely given their lumbar presence, rather pointing towards a local spinal origin, with a possible neurophysiological mechanism being primary afferent depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. We further obtained tentative evidence for an ultra-late negative lumbar potential following lower-limb stimulation after &gt;100 ms. To our knowledge, no spinal SEPs have hitherto been reported at such latencies, although there are hints from early neuromagnetic neck recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] and recent spinal recordings based on optically-pumped magnetometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] have also shown late spinal evoked fields. Taken together, the general possibility to detect late potentials opens the door for investigating local spinal processing going beyond a simple relay of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] as well as supra-spinal modulatory influences on processing in the dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] and here the millisecond resolution of our approach will be ideally suited to disentangle top-down from bottom-up effects.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Enhanced SNR and single-trial responses via multivariate spatial filtering</title><p id="P25">Traditionally, the analysis of SEPs from <italic>ESG</italic> data is based on acquiring a large number of trials, with most studies using single or very few spinal electrodes (though there are a few exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]) and then analysing <italic>single-channel</italic> data. Conversely, methodological advances in <italic>EEG</italic> data acquisition and analysis now allow for a better separation of signal from noise and use high-density <italic>multi-channel</italic> montages for construction of spatial maps, in which the data of the whole set of EEG electrodes is treated as a multivariate signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Our high-density ESG-montage thus enabled the application of methods that combine the information from many channels via spatial filters. Specifically, we used a CCA-based approach – that has previously been applied for extraction of early cortical SEPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>] – and show that spinal SEP extraction is markedly improved with such a multi-channel spatial filtering approach. We believe this approach is especially beneficial for spinal data for two reasons. First, the ESG signal is particularly affected by physiological noise from cardiac and myogenic sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], leading to a low SNR with single-trial amplitudes usually hidden in background noise. Second, despite substantial inter-individual differences in the location of spinal segments relative to vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>], the latter are used as anatomical landmarks for electrode-placement. A spatial filter that compensates for such inter-individual differences will be beneficial for group-level analyses, but also for recovering signals in individual participants, where an electrode placed on a specific anatomical landmark might not capture the spatial peak of the response. Finally, because of volume conduction, potentials from the activation of spinal sources will be reflected in many electrodes and thus a simultaneous use of the signals from many electrodes may also potentially allow extraction of multiple sources when using multivariate methods.</p><p id="P27">By improving the SNR of ESG data, our spatial filtering approach allows not only for extracting more robust spinal SEPs, but also for studying the variability in spinal SEP amplitudes at single-trial level. While there are many benefits to this approach (see below), here we employed it to assess how trial-by-trial response amplitudes co-fluctuate across different processing levels. We observed that the effects of different stimulation conditions (i.e., single-digit, double-digit, and mixed nerve) corresponded to shared variance across the somatosensory processing hierarchy, encompassing peripheral NAPs, spinal SEPs, and early cortical SEPs. This covariance presumably reflected the number of stimulated nerve fibers (which varied between stimulation conditions) as well as the internal state of the activated neuronal populations. Yet additional condition-independent variations might be worth further investigation: during foot stimulation, spinal responses predicted cortical responses, providing a neurophysiological spino-cortical link on the single-trial level.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Integration effects are present already at the spinal level</title><p id="P28">Most importantly, we assessed a fundamental question of sensory processing, namely at which levels of the processing hierarchy information from the receptors is integrated, by testing for integrative processes at peripheral, spinal and cortical levels. In order to do so in a robust manner, we used CCA to extract SEP amplitudes to single-digit and double-digit stimulation and quantified the attenuation effect – a reduced response to double-digit stimulation compared to the summed-up responses to single-digit stimulation – as a measure of integration. Integration effects were not evident in the peripheral nervous system, where response amplitudes faithfully reflected the applied stimulation. Conversely, significant integration effects with medium to large effect sizes were evident consistently after the first synaptic relay, i.e. not only in cortex but already in the spinal cord, the first processing station in the central nervous system. The cortical findings are in line with several previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], but the robust spinal results – which were observed for both upper and lower limb stimulation – go far beyond the previous literature, where only anecdotal evidence of such effects existed at the cervical level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. While the simultaneous recording and assessment of integration effects at peripheral, spinal and cortical levels is a first to our knowledge, the observed progression of increasingly stronger integration effects along the neural hierarchy has been suggested to be a consequence of increasing receptive field size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P29">Two mechanisms have been discussed to underlie integration effects: occlusion and lateral inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. Either mechanism could be at work in the spinal cord, considering the integrative nature of many deep dorsal horn interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] as well as the receptive-field organization of wide dynamic range neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>], both of which have been suggested to contribute to the observed spinal SEPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>].

While there is a multitude of EEG studies assessing cortical responses to various forms of nociceptive stimuli (e.g. laser evoked potentials [LEPs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]], contact heat evoked potentials [CHEPS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]], pinprick evoked potentials [PEPs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]]), a non-invasive assessment of spinal responses to any type of nociceptive stimulation has hitherto not been reported to our knowledge. In a first proof-of-principle experiment, we therefore leveraged the sensitivity increase afforded by our multi-channel set-up to demonstrate concurrently recorded cortical and spinal LEPs. The spinal response occurred at a time-point consistent with the activation of nociceptive A-delta fibres and was observable to varying degrees in every single participant after spatial filtering.</p><p id="P31">While this first demonstration of non-invasively recorded spinal LEPs obviously awaits replication, it is a promising step to investigate entire CNS mechanisms underlying the experience of pain in health and disease. A non-invasive and direct window into spinal nociceptive processing is highly relevant for pain research, considering that the spinal cord is not only the first CNS processing station for nociceptive stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>], but also a target of powerful descending control mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>] and a structure often implicated in pain chronification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Insights for future electrospinography experiments</title><p id="P32">One outstanding question is how the advances introduced by our approach might benefit other fields of human neuroscience, i.e. inspire new work on spinal cord function outside the domain of somatosensation. An immediate experimental implication arises from the here-developed denoising approach: while it was recognized early on that cardiac artifacts dominate the ESG signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and that massive trial-averaging or cardiac-gating was thus necessary, we instead achieved a direct removal of the cardiac artefact via a denoising algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>], eliminating these previous limitations. This allows for example to deliver stimuli spaced across the cardiac cycle and we are thus envisioning the use of our approach for investigating interoceptive processes, where spinal pathways are of importance for brain-body communication but not yet studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. In addition, the sensitivity increase afforded by our multi-channel approach in combination with spatial filters is of benefit for domains where massive trial-averaging is impossible (e.g., in pain research due to ethical and safety reasons) or for experimental paradigms where only a few or even single trials are of interest (e.g., in deviance-detection designs).</p><p id="P33">Our approach could also provide clinical insights, considering that spinal pathologies are a core part of many neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] or chronic neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Relating to this, great strides have recently been made in the recovery of function after spinal cord injury and stroke via spinal neurostimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>]. Here, a non-invasive and temporally-resolved window on such processes – as provided by the CCA-enabled single-trial sensitivity – might offer mechanistic insights into processes underlying such recovery, especially considering the role of afferent input in the treatment of these maladies, as successfully characterized by our approach. Similarly, there are multiple initiatives aimed at developing biomarkers for analgesic drug development to target chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>] and considering that alterations in spinal processing are assumed to be a core feature of chronic pain development and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>], sensitive spinal recordings would be very helpful. In such endeavors, spinal SEPs could potentially serve as objective, non-invasive and innocuous biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P34">In any case, considering that underpowered studies are a troubling issue in neuroscience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>], both experimental and clinical studies that could arise from this work would need to be well-powered. In order to facilitate the planning of such studies, we provide group-level effect sizes, which – reassuringly – were similar across both experiments and mostly in the large range. In addition, we used resampling approaches on both data-sets to i) estimate the minimal number of stimuli to obtain a significant result at the participant-level and ii) jointly estimate the minimal number of stimuli and participants to obtain a significant result at the group-level. Simulating experiments this way allows for giving specific recommendations, such as that for mixed nerve stimulation acquiring ~200 trials in ~10 participants with single-channel recordings almost guarantees a significant group-level effect.</p><p id="P35">Finally, we hope that our non-invasive approach in humans will provide a macro-scale complement to research in animal models, where invasive recording techniques – such as multi-electrode recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>] or calcium imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>] – allow detailed and mechanistic insights into spinal processes occurring at the micro- and mesoscale. It is important to note that our approach of not only recording cervical, but also lumbar spinal cord responses could provide a unique across-species bridge, considering that the vast majority of spinal recordings in experimental animal models are carried out in the lumbar cord.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Limitations and comparison with other CNS-neuroimaging approaches</title><p id="P36">There are several limitations of our approach that are worth discussing. First, the supine positioning of participants might have led to a higher noise level in the ESG data due to electrode movements. While there are several alternative positions, we decided to record data in supine position based on extensive piloting, in which this position was reported to offer the most comfort over the course of the experiment without degrading data quality (e.g., due to tonic muscle activity). Second, we had hoped to reliably record brainstem SEPs arising from the cuneate nucleus (N14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>]) and gracile nucleus (N30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>]), as these are direct recipients of output from the spinal cord via the post-synaptic dorsal-column pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Despite using optimal signal extraction leads, observing brainstem potentials was not possible in all conditions, mainly due to the limited SNR to digit stimulation. Third, it is important to point out that this study introduced a novel methodological approach and was thus focused on the detection of spinal responses to carefully-controlled stimulation that gives rise to a strongly-synchronized high-amplitude signal. One might therefore ask whether this method will perform well under more naturalistic conditions, such as mechanical or thermal stimulation. We believe that the combination of methodological improvements introduced here should also be helpful in such low-SNR scenarios, as already demonstrated exemplarily for single-digit stimulation. Finally, it should also be noted that there is some loss of objectivity when using CCA, considering that a-priori knowledge informed the time-period for training CCA and the choice of component – this might be alleviated in the future by developing automated procedures based on pre-defined criteria.</p><p id="P37">In terms of comparison with other neuroimaging methods for assessing the entire CNS, we note that only fMRI and MEG (based on optically pumped magnetometers [OPMs]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>]) have so far been used for simultaneous assessment of cortico-spinal processes. While corticospinal fMRI – as employed for studying the interactions between supraspinal and spinal structures that underlie resting-state connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>], motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref>] or top-down modulation of nociceptive processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref>] – offers unparalleled spatial resolution, it is an indirect measure of neuronal processes with ensuing low temporal resolution. Here, our approach would provide an important complementary assessment, as it would for example allow for a temporally precise delineation of possible interactions between top-down and bottom-up responses at the spinal level due to its millisecond resolution. OPM-MEG has recently been employed in a proof-of-principle study to simultaneously record spinal and cortical somatosensory-evoked responses similar to those investigated here in Experiment 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>] for corticospinal recordings during a motor task). While the high costs and limited bandwidth of many OPM sensor types currently limit widespread adoption (especially when interested in very fast spinal responses as investigated here), the wearable nature and flexible arrangement possibilities of OPM-MEG make this a very promising methodological approach for entire CNS assessments with high temporal precision.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Outlook</title><p id="P38">In conclusion, we established an approach for the non-invasive recording of spinal cord responses that should be readily-accessible and widely-available, addressing a previously missing link in the study of reciprocal brain-body communication. Our method provides direct recordings of electrophysiological responses with high temporal precision (allowing to investigate different response components, i.e., early and late potentials), has a high sensitivity due to the multivariate combination of spinal multi-channel data (enabling single-trial estimates), and is integrated with the recording of afferent and efferent signals (peripheral and supra-spinal responses). We believe that this approach could be extended to other settings of natural stimulation – such as social touch or pain (for which we provide initial evidence) – and is not only suitable for investigating hard-wired bottom-up processing, but also its modulation by various factors, such as signal integration as demonstrated here to already take place in the human spinal cord. We thus hope to have provided a comprehensive approach that allows for a sensitive and direct assessment of spinal cord responses at millisecond timescale in various fields beyond somatosensation and anticipate its use in the context of interrogating the spinal cord’s role in the interplay of bottom-up and top-down processes that together give rise to our sensations in health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S19" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><sec id="S20"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="P39">42 healthy right-handed volunteers participated in this experiment.

Taking the smaller of these two effect sizes, and aiming for a power of 90% (at an alpha-level of 0.05 with one-tailed testing) resulted in a necessary sample size of 24 participants. Although we were using results obtained from mixed nerve stimulation as the basis for our power calculation (which is known to result in stronger responses than those from stimulation of a purely sensory nerve), we employed a conservative way to estimate our effect size: i) we used raw data that was only preprocessed by a high-pass-filter, ii) we based our power calculation on the lumbar potential that is possibly more difficult to detect, and iii) we selected the same electrode in each participant (cervical: SC6, lumbar: L1) to calculate the group statistics, which is rather conservative especially for the lumbar channels, because the location of the lumbar segments of the spinal cord differs extensively between participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Experimental Design</title><p id="P41">We conducted two experiments in which human participants received electrical stimuli to mixed or sensory parts of an arm and of a leg nerve.

We refer to all finger and all toe stimulation conditions also as ‘hand-sensory’ and ‘foot-sensory’ conditions, because at the fingers and the toes, the median and the stimulated branches of the posterior tibial nerve contain only sensory nerve fibers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> displays the experimental timeline of Experiment 2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Electrical stimulation</title><sec id="S26"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="P44">The electrical stimulus was a 0.2 ms square-wave pulse delivered by two constant-current stimulators (“DS7A”, Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK; one stimulator for each nerve) via a bipolar stimulation electrode with 25 mm electrode distance (“reusable bipolar stimulating surface electrode”, Spes Medica, Genova, Italy) to the left median or the left posterior tibial nerve, respectively. The stimulation electrodes were placed (with the cathode being proximal) at the palmar side of the wrist (median nerve stimulation) and at the median side of the ankle (posterior tibial nerve stimulation).

While we intended to stimulate mixed and sensory parts of the same nerve, when stimulating the fingers or toes, it is not possible to clearly differentiate which nerve is stimulated, since there is an individual variability in the spatial distribution of the dermatomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind when interpreting our results that during stimulation of the index and middle finger, sensory fibers of the median as well as the ulnar and radial nerve might be stimulated (lower limb: sensory fibers of the superficial and deep peroneal nerves). Each of the fingers or toes were stimulated by a different stimulator. The stimulation intensity was set to three times the detection threshold, which was determined via the method of limits. If necessary, i.e., if participants reported to experience the stimulus as less intense over time, the stimulation intensity was slightly increased in-between stimulation blocks based on experience from pilot experiments as well as suggestions by earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref>].

These patches were custom-made and consisted of the same fabric used for the EEG cap (kindly provided by Easycap GmbH). ESG data was referenced to an electrode positioned over the spinous process of the 6<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra (TH6) and the following electrodes were located at anatomical positions: electrode SC1 at the 1<sup>st</sup> cervical vertebra, electrode SC6 at the spinous process of the 6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebra, electrode L1 at the spinous process of the 1<sup>st</sup> lumbar vertebra, and electrode L4 at the spinous process of the 4<sup>th</sup> lumbar vertebra. An additional 16 electrodes were organized in a grid around each one of the two spinal target electrodes SC6 and L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The grid organization, which was developed in pilot experiments, aimed at capturing the spatial distribution of the spinal signal. The midline of this grid was positioned vertically on the spine and consisted of 5 electrodes (the 3<sup>rd</sup> one being the spinal target electrode) with a vertical inter-electrode distance of 2 cm. Two further vertical lines of 4 electrodes each were placed 1 cm to the right and left of the midline electrodes and another two vertical lines of two electrodes each were placed 5 cm to the right and left of the midline. In addition to these dorsally placed electrodes, there were two ventrally placed electrodes – one supra-glottic (AC) and one supra-umbilical electrode (AL). Such ventral electrodes have been described to be beneficial for SEP extraction in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>].

In 6 out of the 36 participants (sub-001 to sub-006) Fz-TH6 was missing in the ESG setup due to a technical error. The active ground electrode stabilized the signal via the “driven right leg” principle. It was placed at POz in the EEG montage and in the middle between TH6 and S20 in the ESG montage.

Peripheral NAPs of the posterior tibial nerve were recorded from the popliteal fossa (with 5 electrodes: one electrode was placed in the center of the fossa and 4 electrodes around it at a distance of 1 cm; all knee channels were referenced to a 3 cm proximal electrode).

Next, the respiration belt was attached at the level of the 9<sup>th</sup>/10<sup>th</sup> rib. Then participants were asked to lay down on a cushioned bench on their back in a semi-darkened and acoustically shielded EEG-cabin. For participant comfort, the head support of the bench was slightly raised and a cushion roll was placed under their knees. Next, electrical stimulation location and intensity were determined and participants were instructed to look at a fixation cross during the stimulation blocks, which was attached to the ceiling. The experiment started with 5 minutes of resting-state recording (eyes open) followed by eight stimulation blocks, each consisting of 500 stimuli. During one block, stimuli were delivered to one nerve only, i.e., either the median or the posterior tibial nerve (thus, there were four median and four posterior tibial nerve stimulation blocks in total). The stimulation blocks were presented in alternating order and the order was counterbalanced across participants. Another two blocks of similar length followed at the end of the experiment – these are not discussed here as they were part of another project and are thus explained in further detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. We used an inter-stimulus-interval of 763 ms with a uniformly distributed jitter of +/– 50 ms in steps of 1 ms. Taken together, each nerve received 2000 stimuli overall.

There were four different types of stimulation: i) mixed nerve stimulation of the median nerve (1 block), ii) mixed nerve stimulation of the tibial nerve (1 block), iii) sensory nerve stimulation at the fingers (4 blocks), and iv) sensory nerve stimulation at the toes (4 blocks). All blocks of one stimulation type were presented in a row (with pauses between blocks) but the order in which the four stimulation types were presented was balanced across subjects. There was one block for hand-mixed and one block for foot-mixed stimulation and each of these blocks contained 2000 stimuli. Sensory nerve stimulation was separated into four blocks (1500 stimuli each) of finger and four blocks (1500 stimuli each) of toe stimulation. During each finger stimulation block, finger1, finger2, and fingers1&amp;2 were stimulated in a pseudo-random order, such that each of the three stimulation conditions occurred 500 times. The same procedure was employed for the toe stimulation blocks, with the only difference that toe1, toe2, and toe12 were stimulated in pseudorandom order. Each type of digit stimulation (finger1/toe1, finger2/toe2, fingers1&amp;2/ toes12) thus consisted of 2000 stimuli.

In the context of EEG, CCA has for example been used as blind source separation approach to remove noise such as muscle activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">116</xref>] and as a technique to improve single-trial classification of evoked potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">117</xref>]. In both cases, the goal is to obtain a spatial filter and consequently a projected component with the largest similarity between two data matrices. Inverting a spatial filter creates corresponding topographies which can then be interpreted in a neurophysiologically meaningful manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref>]. We employed a variant of CCA as used previously for single-trial extraction in EEG data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], also known as canonical correlation average regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].

More precisely, both <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> are of size [number of channels × number of samples] and both <italic>w<sub>x</sub></italic> and <italic>w<sub>y</sub></italic> are of size [number of channels × number of channels] (in the case of full rank), with “number of channels” being 64 for EEG and 17 for ESG and “number of samples” being N (2000 in case of no trial rejection) * 11 (see below for rationale). Applied in this way, the CCA procedure serves as a template matching between the single-trial and the average of all trials. The spatial filter <italic>w<sub>x</sub></italic> corresponds to a spatial weighting of the multi-channel signal to separate SEP-related activity from background noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Since we were interested in early components of the SEP, we only subjected a short time window to CCA (and not the whole epoch length), namely a window from 5 ms before to 5ms after the peak of the cortical or spinal SEP component of interest (resulting in 11 data points per trial). The extracted spatial filter was then applied to the whole length of the epochs. To compute the spatial activity pattern of each CCA component, the spatial filters <italic>wx</italic> were multiplied by the covariance matrix of <italic>X</italic> in order to take the data’s noise structure into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref>]. For each stimulation (median or tibial nerve stimulation), one CCA component was selected for further analyses. These components differed in the different data sets and in the different stimulation conditions: in EEG data of median nerve stimulation, the spatial pattern of the selected CCA component corresponded to the typical N20-P35 tangential dipole over the central sulcus and in EEG data of tibial nerve stimulation, it corresponded to the typical P40 radial dipole over medial somatosensory areas. In ESG data of median nerve stimulation, the spatial pattern of the selected CCA component corresponded to a radial dipole (ventral-dorsal direction) over cervical areas as typical for N13 and in ESG data of tibial nerve stimulation it corresponded to a radial dipole over lumbar areas of the spinal cord as typical for the N22. As expected, the selected component was present in all participants among the first two CCA components, i.e., those with the largest canonical correlation coefficients: for spinal data, we selected the first component in every participant (median first component: N = 36; tibial first component: N = 36) and for cortical data, we nearly always selected the first component (median first component: N = 32; median second component: N = 4; tibial first component: N = 35; tibial second component: N = 1). Because CCA is not sensitive to the polarity of the signal, the spatial filters were multiplied by -1 if necessary, so that the extracted SEP component of interest would always result in the expected peak direction (negative for the cortical N20 and the spinal N13 in the mixed-hand condition, positive for the cortical P40 and negative for the spinal N22 in the mixed-foot condition). Note that for EEG, all channels were subjected to CCA, while for ESG only channels from the electrode patch of interest were subjected to CCA (i.e., the cervical patch in the hand-mixed condition and the lumbar patch in the foot-mixed condition). Last but not least, it is important to note that for such a multivariate analysis the number of samples should in principle be at least ten times the number of variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref>], though more recent efforts also taking into account the effect size suggest an even larger sample-to-feature ratio: e.g. in the case of a between-set correlation of 0.3 (close to the average canonical correlations we observed: 0.25 for median and 0.29 for tibial nerve stimulation) at least 50 samples per feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref>]. In our case, we far exceed the suggested sample-to-feature ratio due to very large number of trials used for training (i.e. in the case of no trial rejections, 2000 trials with 11 data points each compared to 64 (EEG) or 17 (ESG) channels).</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Brainstem potentials</title><p id="P64">Cleaned and epoched EEG and ESG signals, which had been re-referenced during preprocessing to Fz, were combined into one dataset and referenced to a common reference at FPz, since frontal channels have been suggested for the investigation of brainstem potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121">121</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R122">122</xref>].

Using resting-state data from the same participants obtained at the very beginning of Experiment 1, we created a surrogate time series with the same stimulation sequence that we preprocessed in the same way. Over a region of interest consisting of the three central columns of the cervical or lumbar electrode grid, we systematically compared the signal from stimulation-runs and from rest-runs in the time window from 0 ms (stimulation onset) to 600 ms using a cluster-based permutation test (in space and time using the FieldTrip toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">123</xref>]) and focused on responses occurring after the above-reported early potentials (the cluster-based permutation test also identified the N13 and N22, but these are ignored here).

Therefore, we employed Monte Carlo analyses and simulated a large number of experiments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">124</xref>]. For each ‘experiment’, first, a subset of participants (number varying between 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 36) was sampled with replacement and then a subset of trials (number varying between 5 to 1000 in steps of 10, including 1000) was sampled with replacement. The trials were then averaged and a one-sample t-test was used to determine the significance. Each experiment was repeated 1000 times and we report the proportion of experiments that yielded a significant result (at p &lt; 0.05). It is important to note that CCA was only trained once on all trials of mixed-nerve data and then spatial filters were applied to the relevant data, as re-running CCA for each “experiment” was not feasible computationally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Data processing and statistical analysis (Experiment 2)</title><p id="P71">Data processing and analyses followed what is described above for Experiment 1, except that in addition to the hand-mixed and foot-mixed conditions, there were also the hand-sensory (finger1, finger2, fingers1&amp;2) and foot-sensory (toe1, toe2, toes1&amp;2) conditions.</p><sec id="S47"><title>Stimulation artifact removal</title><p id="P72">Identical to Experiment 1, we defined individual artifact windows in cervical and lumbar ESG channels.

One difference to the EEG analysis described in Experiment 1 was that in step three the ICs identified as representing artifactual sources were removed from the EEG signal that i) consisted of concatenated blocks of each stimulation condition only (i.e., hand-mixed, foot-mixed, hand sensory, or foot-sensory) and ii) had zero-phase IIR filtering applied with a 50-Hz comb filter (40th order, bandwidth 0.003) and a band-pass (30-400 Hz) Butterworth filter (4th order); the change in filtering was due to additional line noise and its harmonics introduced by electrical stimulation via ring electrodes. Identical to Experiment 1, noisy time points were removed, but here this did not result in the exclusion of additional channels. In Experiment 2, epochs were cut from 200 ms before to 300 ms after stimulus onset and baseline-corrected (with a reference interval from -110 ms to -10 ms before stimulus onset).

Therefore, zero-phase IIR filtering was applied with a 50-Hz comb filter (40th order, bandwidth 0.003) and a band-pass (30-400 Hz) Butterworth filter (4th order). Similar to Experiment 1, time points with ESG activity above 100 µV were removed from the continuous data, and if more than 50% of data points were removed from a channel, the whole channel was excluded instead. In one participant, two additional channels were removed. The signal was cut into epochs with the same time range as reported for the EEG signal (from -200 ms to to 300 ms around stimulus onset) and epochs were baseline-corrected (reference window -110 ms to -10 ms before stimulus onset).

We thus did not base our estimation as to when expect spinal responses on these estimates, but instead additionally relied on peripheral nerve conduction velocity estimates of A-delta fibres mediating responses to laser stimulation. These have been estimated to vary between 9-18m/s ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R141">141</xref>]: 9m/s; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R142">142</xref>]: 11m/s; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R143">143</xref>]: 13m/s; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R144">144</xref>]: 16m/s; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R133">133</xref>]: 18m/s) and thus suggest possible initial spinal responses to occur roughly 45ms to 90ms after stimulation when i) considering an approximate distance of 80cm between hand dorsum and spinal cord and ii) ignoring any delay between laser stimulation onset and action potential generation in the peripheral nerve. Based on the above considerations, we trained CCA on a time-window of 45ms to 90ms after laser stimulation onset - this is only a heuristic for this first proof-of-principle experiment and it is likely that future studies investigating electrophysiological spinal responses in much more detail might lead to more optimized training windows.</p><p id="P92">For each participant, the first CCA component (as ranked by their canonical correlation coefficient) was selected and the resulting time-courses were averaged across participants to obtain a group-average response. Since CCA is not sensitive to the polarity of the signal and since we observed a negative deflection at ~50ms in the component time-course in 6 out of 7 participants (but a positive deflection at this time-point in participant 2), we multiplied this participant’s time-course by -1 and used this sign-inverted time-course in all further analyses (similar to the procedure used in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2). In order to demonstrate the robustness of the obtained results, we also performed a within-participant four-fold split of the data (i.e. first split: trials 1,5,9,…; second split: trials 2,6,10,…; third split: trials 3,7,11,…; fourth split( trials: 4,8,12,…) after having applied the spatial filter and then averaged the results of each fold across participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S66"><title>Open science</title><p id="P93">Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 were preregistered on the Open Science Framework before the start of data acquisition and the preregistrations are openly available (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/sgptz">https://osf.io/sgptz</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/mjdha">https://osf.io/mjdha</ext-link>); differences between the analyses suggested in the preregistrations and the analyses carried out here are listed in the Supplementary Material.

Sensory stimulation blocks were separated into 4 consecutive blocks of the same stimulation type (either hand-sensory or foot-sensory). <bold>C)</bold> Across both experiments, responses were recorded at the level of the peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain. Peripheral NAPs were recorded from the ipsilateral axilla and Erb’s point for median nerve stimulation and from the ipsilateral popliteal fossa (cluster of 5 electrodes) and the cauda equina for tibial nerve stimulation. Spinal cord SEPs were recorded with a montage of 37 dorsal and 2 ventral electrodes, which had a cervical and a lumbar focus: around an anatomical target electrode (placed over the spinous process of either the 6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebra or the 1<sup>st</sup> lumbar vertebra), 17 electrodes were placed in a grid with distances optimized for capturing the spatial distribution of the spinal signal. Additionally, the following electrodes were contained in the spinal montage: one over the inion, one over the first cervical vertebra, one over the spinous process of the 4<sup>th</sup> lumbar vertebra, and two ventral electrodes (AC located supra-glottically and AL located supra-umbilically). All electrodes of the spinal montage were referenced to an electrode placed over the spinous process of the 6<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra. Cortical SEPs were recorded with a 64-channel EEG setup in Experiment 1 (39 channels in Experiment 2).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158184-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Grand-average NAPs and SEPs along the somatosensory processing hierarchy.</title><p>Group-level responses (N = 36) in the hand-mixed <bold>(A)</bold> and the foot-mixed <bold>(B)</bold> conditions of Experiment 1, with shaded error-bands depicting the standard error.
