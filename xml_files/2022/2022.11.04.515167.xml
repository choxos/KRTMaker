Adipose tissue dysfunction and related features of the metabolic syndrome are not present in most primary mitochondrial disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. One striking exception to this is the recent discovery that a point mutation in human mitofusin 2 (<italic>MFN2</italic>) produces profound adipose tissue dysfunction, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Humans with biallelic p.Arg707Trp MFN2 mutations develop increased upper body adiposity (multiple symmetric lipomatosis) with lower body lipodystrophy. Overgrown adipose depots show deranged ultrastructure of the mitochondrial network but largely normal adipocytes on light microscopy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Affected adipose tissue exhibits a strong transcriptomic signature of activation of the integrated stress response and increased progrowth signalling. This adipose phenotype appears to be specific to the p.Arg707Trp mutation, which has been identified in all reported cases to date. Many other <italic>MFN2</italic> mutations, many effectively leading to loss of one allele (i.e. haploinsufficiency) and often located in the N-terminal GTPase domain, are associated with autosomal dominant sensorimotor neuropathy without an adipose phenotype[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. No monogenic disease attributable to <italic>MFN1</italic> mutations has yet been reported.</p><p id="P26">Within the last 20 years, the dynamic nature of the mitochondrial network has been clearly established, and many of the molecules mediating mitochondrial morphology have been identified[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Mitochondrial network dynamics are entrained to adapt to the cellular nutritional state: starvation or nutrient excess trigger changes in mitochondrial morphology that correspond to functional changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The mitofusins (<italic>MFN1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic>) are GTPases required for fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Loss of either mitofusin leads to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and disrupts its function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. <italic>Mfn1</italic> is widely expressed and is required for mitochondrial fusion whereas <italic>Mfn2</italic> reportedly has additional roles, such as being intimately involved in forming membrane contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] or lipid droplets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and in facilitating apoptosis and mitophagy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Global <italic>Mfn1</italic> or <italic>Mfn2</italic> deletion in mice is embryonically lethal, but knockout of <italic>Mfn2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] specifically in mature adipocytes has illustrated the importance of mitochondrial network dynamics in adipose tissue. Loss of <italic>Mfn2</italic> from <italic>Ucp1</italic>-expressing brown adipose tissue impairs its thermogenic capacity and increases lipid droplet size[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], but surprisingly increases insulin sensitivity. In contrast, deletion of <italic>Mfn2</italic> from mature white adipocytes in adult mice was obesogenic and impaired insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Adipose-specific knock-out of <italic>Mfn1</italic> has yet to be described. Importantly, all promoters used for adipose-specific knockouts to date have been from genes expressed during terminal adipocyte differentiation, so whether loss of one or both mitofusins perturbs the process of adipogenesis, which involves significant expansion of mitochondrial mass[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], is unknown.</p><p id="P28">Differentiation of fibroblast-like cells into mature adipocytes is a well-established experimental paradigm used to dissect molecular regulation of adipogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. In this study we examined the role of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> in adipogenesis using knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), validating findings in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using siRNA-mediated knockdown. We found that loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> enhances adipogenesis, whereas loss of <italic>Mfn2</italic> has no effect on total lipid accumulation but alters lipid droplet morphology and reduces the expression of some adipogenic markers.

Studies of ROS stimulation and blockade in various models of mitochondrial dysfunction may help to delineate a causal role for ROS in the enhanced adipogenesis observed in <italic>Mfn1</italic>-deficient cells. However, such experiments require careful titration of relatively toxic agents that may inhibit adipogenesis through non-specific cellular damage. Multiple tissue-specific knock-outs for both <italic>Mfn1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] and <italic>Mfn2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] have identified changes in ROS. Liver-specific knock-out of <italic>Mfn2</italic> was associated with increased hydrogen peroxide and reduced expression of subunits from Complex IV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Mfn2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs have reduced membrane potential compared to wild-type[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], which, along with lower Complex I expression, may influence their degree for ROS generation through reverse electron transport[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>].</p><p id="P72">An important limitation of this work is a lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> data to support this hypothesised role for <italic>Mfn1</italic> in adipogenesis. Adipose-specific <italic>Mfn1</italic> knock-out mice, although briefly said in one study not to have a gross adipose phenotype, have not been characterised in any detail[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. An important limitation of such a model in any case relates to the fact that deletion of ‘floxed’ <italic>Mfn1</italic> was under control of the adiponectin-promoter[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Adiponectin is only expressed in mature adipocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] so such an experiment does not test the impact of Mfn1 deficiency early in adipocyte development. The data reported herein was also exclusively conducted in murine cells. Whilst we found broadly concordant observations in two different cell lines we have not studied human adipocytes. There are currently no known human disorders linked to <italic>MFN1</italic> mutations but based on our findings, we would hypothesise that individuals carrying such mutations may be more insulin sensitive and therefore may not present with a clinical disease phenotype. However, germline <italic>Mfn1</italic> mutations would also perturb Mfn1 function in other tissues which may have a greater phenotypic impact than that related to altered adipose expression. On the other hand human population frequencies of sequence variants in <italic>MFN1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic> suggest that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>MFN1</italic> may not be selected against, unlike loss-of-function variants in <italic>MFN2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>].</p><sec id="S28" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4.1</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P73">At endogenous levels, MFN1 appears to exercise tonic physiological restraint on differentiation to adipocytes in culture, whereas the closely related MFN2 is necessary for expression of the full programme of adipogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS156746-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d149aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><label>5</label><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the support of the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre (University of Cambridge, UK) for performing, processing, and imaging of transmission electron microscope studies.
