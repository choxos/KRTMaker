As the pandemic has progressed, Variants of Concern (VOC) have emerged with lineage defining mutations. Using a SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetic system, based on transformation associated recombination in yeast, a series of replicons were produced for the ancestral Wuhan virus and the SARS-CoV-2 VOC Delta in which different combinations of the Spike, membrane, ORF6 and ORF7a coding sequences were replaced with sequences encoding the selectable marker puromycin N-acetyl transferase and reporter proteins (<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase, mNeonGreen and mScarlet).

Like SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, it is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing ‘coronavirus disease 19’ (COVID-19)-pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The first detected case of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China (December 2019) and was followed by rapid dissemination, resulting in the declaration of the current COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a capped, positive-sense RNA genome of ~30 kb that contains two large 5’ open reading frames (ORFs) followed by several, smaller 3’ ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). At the 5’-end of the genome there is a highly structured untranslated region (UTR) followed by ORF1a and ORF1ab that encode the large polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Translation of ORF1ab is mediated by a -1 ribosomal frameshift event during translation of ORF1a and determines the ratio of ORF1a:ORF1ab encoded viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). pp1a and pp1ab are post-translationally processed by viral encoded proteases to yield 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) which are highly conserved between coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). ORF1a and ORF1ab are followed by several smaller 3’-terminal ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 3’ ORFs are each preceded by a body transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS-B). During negative strand RNA synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase halts after synthesis of the negative sense TRS-B sequence. These are complementary in sequence to the TRS located in the 5’-leader sequence (TRS-L) of the 5’ UTR, allowing for template switching during negative strand synthesis. This results in the generation of nine sub-genomic negative-sense RNA templates by discontinuous transcription which are in turn used to transcribe positive sense sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The sgRNAs encode structural (Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)) and small accessory proteins that modulate the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Cellular infection is established after the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein binds to the cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, initiating direct membrane fusion and/or receptor mediated endocytosis. Release of the N protein associated genome (ribonucleoprotein) into the cytoplasm initiates translation and production of the viral polyproteins. These polyproteins are co- and post-translationally cleaved into individual nsps which then assemble into viral replication complexes. Concurrently these nsps drive the distortion of the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate complex, to form membrane enclosed vesicles within the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Reverse genetics is a molecular biology technique that can be used to edit and engineer nucleic acid sequences to study the effect of a specific genotype on a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). For viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes, the viral genome can be manipulated indirectly by cloning the full-length genome as cDNA under the control of an appropriate promoter (most commonly a T7/SP6 RNA polymerase promoter or cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMVie) promoter). The production of viral RNA transcripts with an authentic 5’-end can either occur by transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (RNA launched) or can occur in host cells using host RNA polymerase II (DNA launched) such as in the case of the CMVie promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In the former case the <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA transcripts are introduced into permissive host cells by transfection to recover virus.</p><p id="P6">For many viruses; especially highly pathogenic viruses with work restricted to biosafety level (BSL)-3 and -4, sub-genomic viral replicons have been useful surrogates to study virus replication and its effect on the host cell, as well as a valuable tool for screening antiviral compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). They may also be of particular use where viruses are not permissive to growth in standard cell culture models; as has been the case for hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Common to all replicons is their inability to assemble infectious particles; most commonly achieved by replacing one or more structural genes with gene sequences encoding reporter proteins or selectable markers, whilst retaining all sequence motifs and gene products essential for all other aspects of the viral life cycle (most importantly genome replication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The groundwork for CoV replicon systems stems from the early 2000s, with the establishment of reverse genetics systems for a number of CoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The first CoV replicon system was developed in 2004 for HCoV-229E, shortly after the emergence of the highly pathogenic coronavirus, SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Previously sub-genomic CoV replicons, both DNA and RNA launched, have been developed using the minimal requirements for replication; the 5’/3’ UTRs and ORF1ab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The presence of the N protein acts to enhance replication and its production has been achieved both <italic>cis</italic>, by including the N-TRS and N coding sequence in the replicon, and <italic>in trans</italic>, using heterologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Such minimal replicons allow the study of only the minimal set of viral genes for replication and when studying other aspects of the virus life cycle, e.g. particle formation or the role of accessory proteins, the replicon must be expanded to incorporate other regions of the CoV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). As the introduction of replicon genomes into cells (large DNA plasmids/<italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts) is technically demanding and relatively inefficient, dispensable viral gene coding sequences, most commonly S, have been replaced with the coding sequence of an antibiotic resistance gene in order to select cell populations that stably express the replicon, which can then be used to analyse compounds or host-virus interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To date several approaches have been undertaken for the construction of SARS-CoV-2 replicons. So far, the reported replicon systems for SARS-CoV-2 mainly relied on transfection of <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA transcripts (derived from replicon cDNA clones under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter) into permissive cells, circumventing background expression of reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), and providing a convenient amplification step. These studies followed similar approaches used to establish replicon bearing cell lines for other CoVs and mainly relied on replacement of the S coding sequence with either sequence/s encoding reporter-selectable marker fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) or a reporter protein, with an antibiotic resistance gene product encoded from a different sgRNA (e.g. E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In nearly all investigations, SARS-CoV-2 replicons were found to both exert high cytotoxicity, when introduced into cells either as minimal replicons containing only ORF1ab and essential control elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) or as larger replicons lacking one or more structural proteins but retaining the accessory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The replicons constructed in this investigation retained most viral gene coding sequences except for those of S and M, to prevent assembly of infectious virions/VLPs, and either ORF6 or ORF7a. Others also opted for an approach that conserves most viral genes. Common to these studies and ours, was poor transfection efficiency of most cell lines tested with replicon RNA, as well as a failure to establish stable cell lines due to replicon cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). However, we identified a Vero cell line overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 which is transfected with high efficiency with <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA transcripts derived from replicons corresponding to both the ancestral Wuhan sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 VOC Delta and is permissive for transient replicon RNA replication. As the replicons developed in this investigation express both a reporter enzyme and fluorescent marker protein, they can be used conveniently in reporter assays.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P10">Human Caco-2 cells (ATCC<sup>®</sup> HTB-37™; a kind gift from Dr Darryl Hill, University of Bristol) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and used to produce Caco-2 cells constitutively expressing human ACE2 (Caco-2/ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), a kind gift from Dr Yohei Yamauchi, University of Bristol).

To produce transcripts for mock transfections the GTP concentration was increased to 7.5 mM and cap analogues were not added. The reaction mixes were then incubated at 30 °C for 3 hours. After incubation, the reaction mix was treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase to degrade template DNA. The reaction mix was then either used directly for electroporation or purified by LiCl precipitation, followed by three 75% ethanol washes and resuspended in ultra-pure water.

Nsp1 is the first SARS-CoV-2 protein translated and has been reported to inhibit host translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). It has low sequence conservation amongst the betacoronaviruses (and is absent in gamma-/deltacoronaviruses), however its ability to interfere with host innate immunity at the transcriptional and/or translational level is highly conserved (e.g. for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). The nsp1 residues K164 and H165 are essential for inhibition of host cell translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) and the double substitution K164A/H165A was previously reported to lead to complete loss of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 function with respect to translation shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>).

The resultant SARS-CoV-2 replicon was termed pSC2-Rep-Wu-Gp-RL.</p><p id="P31"><italic>In vitro</italic> RNA transcripts were prepared from the linearised pSC2-Rep-Wu-Gp-RL plasmid and transfected into four different mammalian cell lines to test the replicative ability of the replicon; African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) modified to express TMPRSS2 (VTN), Vero E6 cells modified to express TMPRSS2 and ACE2 (VAT), human lung epithelial cells (A549) modified to express TMPRSS2 and ACE2 (A549-AT) and human liver epithelial cells (Huh 7.5). <italic>In vitro</italic> RNA transcripts from the replicon construct were capable of initiating replication in all cell types, as determined by the detection of RLuc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Rluc is encoded by a sgRNA produced during virus replication and is therefore a marker for the replication of replicon RNA. Luminescence was detected consistently at low levels as early as 12 hours post-transfection for all cells. The kinetics of RLuc expression were similar in the four cell types with maximal RLuc activity observed between 24-36 hours post-transfection over a 96-hour observation period. However, the levels of RLuc activity were markedly different in the VAT cells (peak of 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> relative luminescence units (RLU)) compared to the other three cell types (peaks of 1.5 – 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> RLU). To investigate this further, the transfection efficiency of the four cell lines with the replicon transcripts was monitored by eGFP fluorescence. Although RLuc activity was detected in all four cell types, eGFP fluorescence was not. To determine if the eGFP-pac fusion protein was expressed by the replicon RNA transcripts, eGFP was detected by antibody staining and replicon replication examined by antibody staining for dsRNA and the N protein, both markers of coronavirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).

Nevertheless, transfected cells were placed under puromycin selection, but it was not possible to isolate cells that proliferated under selection after 10 days. The eGFP-pac gene encodes a functional fusion protein as it was derived from a dengue virus replicon cDNA clone that was used to produce puromycin resistant and green, fluorescent cells that stably express a dengue virus replicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 eGFP-pac replicon construct verified the intact sequence was present. It is likely that the eGFP-pac fusion protein was either produced at very low levels or folded improperly in cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Therefore, the pSC2-Rep-Wu-Gp-RL was modified further with the aim of producing a functional dual reporter replicon construct.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Construction of second-generation Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 dual-reporter replicons</title><p id="P33">To produce a functional dual reporter replicon, the Spike and M gene coding sequences were replaced with a codon-optimised <italic>pac</italic> gene coding sequence and RLuc coding sequence respectively.

Both VAT and VTN cells were produced from VeroE6 cells; suggesting that cell specific differences in replicon transfection efficiency existed in the original cells used for producing the VAT and VTN cells or differences arose during the selection and propagation of the cells.

As the replicons lack the S coding sequence they provide a useful tool to study the effects of drugs on intracellular virus replication.
