Their clinical manifestations span a broad range of severity and include self-resolving cutaneous ulcers, debilitating mucocutaneous lesions and lethal systemic disease. The disease group affects the poorest communities with an estimated 700 000 - 1 million new cases each year, and around 1 billion people at risk of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The causative protozoan parasites of over 20 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species are transmitted between mammalian hosts by bites of infected female phlebotomine sand flies. The cycling between a mammalian host and insect vector, and movement between different niches within a single host, expose parasites to dramatic changes in environment. In the sand fly, <italic>Leishmania</italic> migrate through different parts of the digestive tract and develop from proliferating procyclic promastigotes to infective non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes that are pre-adapted for survival in their mammalian host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. After transmission to the new host these highly motile flagellated promastigotes again experience changes in temperature, pH, nutrients and host-derived factors, and transform to intracellular amastigotes. Successful transmission and survival of parasites relies on their rapid adaptation to these many changes through efficient sensing of the environment and triggering of the appropriate response to drive proliferation, differentiation and/or quiescence.</p><p id="P3">Eukaryotes, including plants, yeasts, worms, flies and mammals control cell growth and differentiation in response to nutrients and environmental cues through the atypical serine/threonine kinase, TOR (target of rapamycin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TOR is highly conserved and is found in multiprotein TOR complexes (TORCs) which differ in their components, regulation and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In mammals, a single TOR forms part of two complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, while the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has two TOR orthologues that participate in TORCs with equivalent functions to those in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>Leishmania,</italic> like the closely related kinetoplastid <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, has four TOR orthologues, TOR1 to TOR4. TOR1 and TOR2 are essential in <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes and have not been characterized, while TOR3 is required for mammalian infectivity and acidocalcisome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> TOR4 remains unexplored but it was shown in <italic>T. brucei</italic> to form part of a complex, TORC4, which negatively regulates differentiation to quiescent stumpy form parasites that are pre-adapted for infection of their tsetse fly vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. TORC1 has been studied extensively in many eukaryotic organisms; it senses intracellular nutrient and energy levels to regulate anabolic and catabolic processes. In addition to TOR and its constitutive binding partner, mLST8 (mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8), TORC1 contains a complex-specific 150-kDa protein named RPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Kog1 in S. cerevisiae). This adapter protein most likely arose with TOR in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and has been conserved with TOR during further evolution of eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Due to its role in recruitment of substrates for phosphorylation by TOR, RPTOR is essential for TORC1 functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we defined the TORC1 complex in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and investigated its function through the DiCre-based conditional gene deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> of <italic>RPTOR</italic> (named <italic>RPTOR1).</italic> Our proteomic analyses demonstrate that <italic>Leishmania</italic> RPTOR1 interacts with TOR1 and LST8, confirming it as a component of <italic>Leishmania</italic> TORC1.

Notably, <italic>RPTOR1</italic> deletion caused differentiation of procyclic promastigotes to non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes and prevented dedifferentiation of metacyclic promastigotes to dividing retroleptomonads. In addition, complementation with mutant versions of RPTOR1 revealed that a potentially catalytic histidine cysteine dyad in its caspase-like domain is not required for RPTOR1 function showing that it is a pseudopeptidase.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Leishmania</italic> RPTOR1 interacts with TOR1</title><p id="P5">To define the TORC1 complex in <italic>Leishmania</italic> we generated <italic>L. mexicana</italic> lines expressing N-terminally Twin-Strep-tagged RPTOR1 (LmxM.25.0610), TOR1 (LmxM.36.6320) or the control bait LmxM.29.3580 using a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated endogenous tagging approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. RPTOR1 or TOR1 were enriched from parasite lysates with Streptactin-XT, allowing specific elution with biotin and quantitative analysis of complexes by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). A RPTOR1-TOR1 interaction was detected in both pulldowns and LST8 co-enriched with both RPTOR1 and TOR1 indicating that <italic>Leishmania</italic> RPTOR1 associates with two proteins that are key components of TORC1 in other eukaryotes. The TOR1 pull-down also detected an HSP90 chaperone (referred to as HSP83-1), the co-chaperone HIP (HSC-70 interacting protein, LmxM.08_29.0320) and two additional proteins that have been linked to TOR signalling or regulation in other organisms, RUVBL1 (LmxM.33.3500) and RUVBL2 (LmxM.33.2610), which are homologues of the ATPases Pontin (RUVBL1) and Reptin (RUVBL2). Interestingly, two proteins with no known function (LmxM.16.1080 and LmxM.08_29.1470) were significantly enriched in both the RPTOR1 and TOR1 purifications, indicating that they might form part of the core TORC1 complex in <italic>Leishmania.</italic> Homology and protein domain searches with the 646 amino acid sequence of LmxM.16.1080 revealed homologous sequences in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Leptomonas spp;</italic> however, no protein domains were predicted. LmxM.08_29.1470 contains an ankyrin repeat domain suggesting a role in protein-protein interaction, and orthologues of this 711 amino acid protein are present in several kinetoplastids including <italic>Trypanosoma, Leishmaniiae, Strigamonadinae and Bodo saltans.</italic></p><p id="P6">To confirm the interaction of RPTOR1 and TOR1 we co-expressed RPTOR1-HA and TOR1-Myc in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and performed western blotting on immuno-precipitated complexes. <italic>L. mexicana</italic> with untagged RPTOR1, or parasite lines singly expressing RPTOR1-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) or TOR1-Myc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>) were included as controls.

To investigate whether RPTOR1 is also essential for <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes, we attempted to generate <italic>RPTOR1</italic> null mutants in <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana.</italic> Multiple attempts to replace <italic>RPTOR1</italic> in <italic>L. major</italic> using standard homologous recombination and in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homologous recombination failed to generate homozygous knockout mutants despite the generation of heterozygous mutants. These observations suggested indirectly that RPTOR1 may be essential for promastigote survival. To provide direct evidence for essentiality and explore the functional consequence of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> deletion we made use of a DiCre conditional gene deletion system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> which excises <italic>LoxP</italic> flanked (floxed) <italic>RPTOR1</italic> following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). A DiCre expressing <italic>L. major</italic> cell line (DiCre) was modified to replace one <italic>RPTOR1</italic> allele with a floxed GFP-tagged <italic>RPTOR1</italic> expression cassette (<italic>RPTOR</italic><sup>+/flox</sup>) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> allele with an antibiotic (hygromycin) resistance cassette (<italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup>). Diagnostic PCR amplification confirmed the integration of the knockout and expression cassettes in several hygromycin resistant clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Two of these clones, clones 1 and 2, were selected for further analysis, and PCR showed that rapamycin treatment of these <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> promastigotes for 3 days induced excision of the <italic>RPTOR1</italic> coding sequence (CDS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Rapamycin is well known as an inhibitor of mammalian TOR, however in trypanosomatids the residues important for rapamycin binding are mutated, making them relatively insensitive to rapamycin inhibition of TOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To ensure we could distinguish between RPTOR1 deletion and other potential rapamycin-specific effects, we also included the control cell line (DiCre) treated with rapamycin in all experiments. Flow cytometry of live promastigotes indicated a complete loss of RPTOR1-GFP protein in inducible knockout cell lines (<italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> clones 1 and 2) following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The GFP signal in both clones was reduced to the level detected in the DiCre control cells.</p><p id="P8">To characterise the essential role of RPTOR1 for <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival we started our analyses by looking at parasite proliferation. Excision of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in promastigote proliferation compared to uninduced (DMSO-treated) <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> cells and the parental cell line, DiCre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Cell densities in the rapamycin-treated lines were 30â€“40% lower on day 4 and 70â€“80% lower by day 7 after treatment compared to the controls. To assess the effect of RPTOR1 loss on long-term parasite survival we used a clonogenic assay and found that rapamycin-induced RPTOR1 depletion caused an 80â€“96% reduction in clone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, PCR analysis showed that all surviving clones retained a copy of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>) confirming an essential role for RPTOR1 in parasite survival. We next explored the reason for reduced cell proliferation and survival in the absence of RPTOR1. Flow cytometry of live cells stained with propidium iodide indicated that <italic>RPTOR1</italic> excision did not cause a significant amount of cell death on days 5 and 6 after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). However, induced <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; there was a 26â€“32 % increase of cells in G1, a 39â€“46 % reduction in S and a 19â€“32 % reduction in G2/M compared to the uninduced control cells on day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). At later time points (day 8) both uninduced and rapamycin-induced DiCre and <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> lines were arrested in G1, consistent with the predicted development of non-proliferative metacyclic promastigotes in a late stage nutrient-depleted <italic>in vitro</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results suggest that RPTOR1 plays an essential role in promastigote cell proliferation and survival, and that its loss results in cell cycle arrest in G1. Importantly, we observed the same cell proliferation defect and cell cycle arrest in our two independently generated <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> clones.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>RPTOR1 controls protein synthesis and cell size</title><p id="P9">TORC1 signalling in humans regulates protein synthesis and cell growth. We asked whether RPTOR1 depletion impacts these essential processes in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Protein synthesis, measured by incorporation of the synthetic methionine analogue L-azidohomoalanine (AHA), was reduced by 51% and 90% in <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> clones 1 and 2, respectively following rapamycin-induced loss of RPTOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To analyse cell growth, the size of promastigote parasites was measured by forward light scatter using flow cytometry on day 5 and 8 after induction. In this protocol cells from log-phase promastigote cultures were diluted in fresh nutrient rich medium on day 3 so that cells should be actively proliferating and exhibiting normal growth at day 5. By day 8 media is more depleted of nutrients and parasites would have differentiated to metacyclic promastigotes which are smaller in size compared to the proliferating procyclic promastigotes of day 5. Forward scatter was reduced following <italic>RPTOR1</italic> excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and C</xref>); on day 5 the geometric means in <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> lines decreased by 6â€“65 % compared to the uninduced controls, and by 37â€“43% compared to the DiCre control. Two cell populations based on size were visible in the induced <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> lines with 23.6â€“40.4 % and 71.4â€“78.7% smaller cells measured on day 5 and 8, respectively. By day 8 the DiCre cells had also reduced in size consistent with the development of smaller metacyclic promastigotes, but these cells were still larger than the cells measured in the <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> lines. Interestingly, the uninduced <italic>RPTORT1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> lines had increased forward scatter compared to the DiCre line at both day 5 and day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We next measured cell size by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of one of our <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> clones (clone 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). SEM images revealed that the difference in cell size observed by flow cytometry is related to a decrease in body width of parasites (mean Â± SD, 1.5 Â± 0.3 Î¼m in rapamycin-induced compared to 2.0 Â± 0.3 Î¼m in uninduced). Additionally, body and flagellum length were increased in <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells with body lengths of 9.4 Â± 2.8 Î¼m for rapamycin-induced compared to 7.5 Â± 1.9 Î¼m for uninduced cells and flagellum lengths of 13.8 Â± 4.2 Î¼m for rapamycin-induced compared to 8.1 Â± 3.9 Î¼m for uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Rapamycin treatment of DiCre control cells resulted in an increase in body width and a decrease in flagellum length. These results indicate that RPTOR1 is important for promastigote protein synthesis and normal cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Functional analysis of RPTOR1 caspase domain</title><p id="P10">RPTOR1 is a large protein molecule consisting of 1471 residues, composed of the characteristic domains of human RPTOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). It features a raptor N-terminal conserved (RNC) region (Raptor N-terminal Caspase-like domain), with ~38 % identity to the human RNC, an Armadillo repeat domain and C-terminal WD40 repeats, both implicated in protein-protein interactions. The RNC region is structurally similar to caspases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; it contains an Î±-Î²-Î± sandwich fold with an apparent histidine-cysteine (His-Cys) dyad near the caspase active site. As there are no three-dimensional structures of LmRPTOR1, a structural alignment and topological comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> RAPTOR1 RNC (AtRAPTOR1) with human Caspase-7 (<italic>Hs</italic>Caspase-7) was carried out. This showed that the secondary structural elements of AtRAPTOR1 and HsCaspase-7 are highly conserved, along with the position of the catalytic histidine and the glycine that follows it. However, in AtRAPTOR1 a serine (Ser<sup>246</sup>) directly aligns with the Caspase-7 active site cysteine although a cysteine (Cys<sup>245</sup>) does directly precede it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

Structural superposition of the Alphafold model of <italic>L. infantum</italic> RPTOR1 (LINF_250011400), AtRAPTOR1 and HsCaspase-7 using UCSF Chimera confirmed our results above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To assess whether <italic>Leishmania</italic> RPTOR1 requires protease activity from the caspase-like RNC for its function we generated addback lines in <italic>RPTOR1</italic><sup>-/flox</sup> clone 2 by integration of untagged and HA-tagged wildtype and active site mutant <italic>RPTOR1</italic> in the ribosomal locus. For the active site mutant, the cysteine at position 269 in the predicted His-Cys dyad was mutated to an alanine (C269A). This resulted in the creation of <italic>CI2::pRib-RPTOR1, CI2::pRib-RPTOR1</italic>-HA, <italic>CI2::pRib-RPTOR1<sup>C269A</sup></italic> and <italic>CI2::pRib-RPTOR1-HA<sup>C269A</sup>.</italic> Western blot analyses were performed with either anti-HA antibodies or antibodies raised against a recombinant 462 amino acid <italic>L. major</italic> RPTOR1 fragment. This detected expression of RPTOR1 or RPTOR1-HA following rapamycin-induced excision of floxed <italic>RPTOR1</italic> in the endogenous locus of the addback lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Expression of RPTOR1, RPTOR1-HA, RPTOR1<sup>C269A</sup> or RPTOR1-HA<sup>C269A</sup> restored parasite proliferation following rapamycin-induced excision of floxed <italic>RPTOR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). We also observed rescue of the cell size defect and G1 cell cycle arrest with RPTOR1 or RPTOR1<sup>C269A</sup> re-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5F and G</xref>). These results indicate that re-expression of RPTOR1 restores the phenotypes observed after rapamycin-induced excision of floxed RPTOR1 and provides confidence that these phenotypes are specific for RPTOR1 deletion. Furthermore, the disruption of the potential catalytic site cysteine in the caspase-likedomain does not impact on complementation of RPTOR1 function suggesting that RPTOR1 caspase activity is therefore not required for promastigote proliferation and growth.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RPTOR1 loss induces parasite differentiation to metacyclic promastigotes</title><p id="P12"><italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes undergo several biochemical and morphological changes in their sand fly hosts to eventually differentiate into mammalian-infective metacyclic promastigotes.

In <italic>T. brucei</italic> two distinct TOR1 and TOR2 complexes were identified with TORC1 containing TOR1 and RPTOR, and TORC2 containing TOR2 and RICTOR. Our proteomic analysis of the RPTOR1 and TOR1-containing complexes showed that <italic>Leishmania</italic> RPTOR1 directly associates with TOR1 and LST8 to form TORC1. The RPTOR1-TOR1 interaction was furthermore confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, our mass spectrometry also identified two proteins of unknown function (Gene IDs: LmxM.16.1080 and LmxM.08_29.1470) that interact with both TOR1 and RPTOR1. Bioinformatic analysis did not reveal any known homologues or published data to predict potential functions for these proteins, so further work is required to establish their role in TOR signalling and parasite growth. Other TOR1 interactors included the AAA+ family ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, the molecular chaperone HSP83 (an HSP90 homologue) and the co-chaperone HIP, which associates with intermediate HSP90 and HSP70 complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.

It was not surprising to find the chaperone HSP90 (named HSP83 in <italic>Leishmania)</italic> associated with TOR1 â€“ many HSP90 clients are involved in signalling, and TOR and RPTOR1 have been identified as HSP90 interactors by others (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.picard.ch/Hsp90Int/index.php">http://www.picard.ch/Hsp90Int/index.php</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.

Loss of RPTOR1 induced proliferation arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, inhibited protein synthesis and induced physiological changes characteristic of their differentiation to quiescent metacyclic promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). RPTOR1 loss in other systems such as yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae)</italic> and a range of different mammalian cell types results in a similar G1 cell cycle arrest and either inhibits cell cycle progression in proliferating cells or prevents cell cycle entry from quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We observed these effects in log-stage promastigotes, which differentiated to non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes and were unable to re-enter cell cycle to differentiate to retroleptomonads. Importantly, metacyclogenesis is not an automatic consequence of reduced proliferation.

However, inhibiting the purine salvage pathway reduces proliferation but does not trigger metacyclogenesis. Conversely, supplementing parasites with a purine salvage pathway intermediate can induce proliferation while not interfering with metacyclogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Our work shows that deletion of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> produces metacyclic parasites even in nutrient rich medium, suggesting that purine or other nutrient sensing is upstream and provides a key activating signal to <italic>Leishmania</italic> TORC1, preventing metacyclogenesis under normal conditions. A reduction in TORC1 activity either through inducible deletion of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> or depletion of purines, inhibits proliferation and triggers the metacyclic differentiation program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). It is also possible that <italic>RPTOR1</italic> deletion causes irreversible differentiation of parasites to metacyclic promastigotes that can no longer proliferate in response to nutrient availability through other pathways. On the contrary, overexpression of <italic>RPTOR1</italic> with potential overactivation of TORI results in a decrease in metacyclogenesis and more proliferation of cells when purines are available. Others have reported a similar correlation between RPTOR levels or TOR1 activation and cell proliferation. Overexpression of RPTOR in cancer cells increases TOR1 activation and cell proliferation while silencing of RPTOR has the opposite effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

Further support for this comes from a recent study that investigated the Rag GTPases in the visceralizing species <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.

A combined peak list was exported in .mgf format for database searching against the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> subset of the TriTrypDB database (8,250 sequences; 5,180,224 residues), appended with common proteomic contaminants (116 sequences; 38,371 residues). Mascot Daemon (version 2.6.0, Matrix Science) was used to submit the search to a locally-running copy of the Mascot program (Matrix Science Ltd., version 2.7.0). Search criteria specified: Enzyme, trypsin; Max missed cleavages, 1; Fixed modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C); Variable modifications, Oxidation (M), Phosphorylation (S,T); Peptide tolerance, 3 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.5 Da; Instrument, ESI-TRAP. Peptide identifications were passed through the percolator algorithm to achieve a 1% false discovery rate assessed against a reverse database and individual matches filtered to require minimum expect score of 0.05. The Mascot .XML result file was imported into Progenesis QI and peptide identifications associated with precursor peak areas and matched between runs. Relative protein abundance was calculated using precursor ion areas from non-conflicting unique peptides. Accepted protein quantifications were set to require a minimum of two unique peptide sequences. Statistical testing was performed in Progenesis QI from ArcSinh normalised peptide abundances and ANOVA-derived p-values were converted to multiple test-corrected q-values using the Hochberg and Benjamini approach. Label free protein intensities were analysed with SAINTq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> to determine interacting proteins. Identified proteins in RPTOR1 and TOR1 affinity purifications were quantified relative to levels in the control bait (LmxM.29.3580) purification.

Availability of nutrients (nutrient replete) activates TORC1 to promote parasite proliferation and growth while metacyclogenesis is inhibited. This can be enhanced through the supplementation of media with adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>) or adenosine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and/or through overexpression of RPTOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Conversely, when nutrients are depleted or TORC1 is inactivated through the deletion of RPTOR1, parasite proliferation and growth are inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and metacyclogenesis occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-D</xref>).
