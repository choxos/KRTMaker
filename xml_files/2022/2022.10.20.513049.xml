We upgraded this strategy one step further using clinically proven spike protein by considering the delta and post-delta omicron variant of concern (VOC) mutations and nucleocapsid peptides conferring T-cell immunity. Nucleocapsid peptides are considered much better immunological replacement of nucleocapsid proteins. Hence, peptide linking strategy is applied which is more economic for cellular biosynthesis than whole proteins. An envelope peptide with potent T-cell immune response is also selected. All these peptides are clustered in this hybrid spike’s designed cytoplasmic region separated by non-immunogenic helical linkers. The resulting domain is more folded in the construct devoid of transmembrane domain after AlphaFold analysis. Alongside, we also propose the idea of introduction of any T-cell peptide like other Human Corona Viruses (HuCoV) in these linker regions whenever required. In addition to SARS-COV-2, the same approach can be applied for any emergency or even long-term unsolved outbreaks of Influenza, Dengue and West Nile Virus etc. In this era of novelty as presented by subunit and nucleic acid vaccines, multiepitope strategies like this can help to combat multiple diseases successfully in real time to give hope for better future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>De-novo protein design</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 variants</kwd><kwd>Vaccine design</kwd><kwd>Molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>AlphaFold, RosettaFold</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">SARS-COV-2-19 has brought the world to an unprecedented standstill for the last four years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The massacre and chaos created are prevailing still. This infection demonstrates a wide clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate disease to even long term positivity and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Also, new variants are appearing regularly with mutations in anti-spike antibody binding sites causing new panic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although, mortality in infected patients is lower than earlier SARS, serious further complications are seen in reinfected and even in vaccinated populations. These include myocarditis, damage to CNS etc. that too in 30-40 years’ population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Reinfection with emerging newer variants is also a cause of concern <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In this scenario question arises on sustainability of vaccines based on only wild type spike <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The spike protein which elicits neutralizing antibodies is essential for recovery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, the problem is the short term of the direct mucosal immune response. Long-term memory in mucosal immune response is generated by T cell response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In children older than 2 years, infections by closely related corona viruses (Common cold) generate mild and asymptotic response against OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63 (HuCoV) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Several immune response studies on these HuCoV infections have been carried out <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> so far. By the age of 2-5 years, 80% of children are immunized and have persistent neutralizing antibodies for life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The associated T cell response is also highly effective to generate memory response and lower severity in infected COVID patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Several studies also suggest that T-cell immune response inducing nucleocapsid protein has to be included in potential corona vaccine strategy pipelines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This can be a promising approach to curb circulating Delta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, Omicron variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and other recombinants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Both Delta and Omicron (BA.1) are crucial as they mark the transition between pre-vaccination and post vaccination immune responses. Therefore, it is important to design a vaccine with delta-omicron spike protein and T cell epitopes. For this, we have designed a construct using chimeric SARS-COV-2 spike and SARS-COV-2 T cell epitope sequences. Structural proteins with almost conserved sequences for different corona virus families were targeted for potential T-cell enticing candidates. Functional proteins were not considered since some of them are known to hijack MHC systems in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Several studies previously showed the homology of nucleocapsid protein sequences between SARS-COV-2 and HuCoV strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Also, T-cell response of SARS-COV-2 unexposed individuals to SARS-COV-2 was previously reported for one peptide from envelope protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> indicating potential effect from common cold immunity. Therefore, we exclusively focused on nucleocapsid protein and envelope protein for T cell epitopes and compared with convalescent patients’ T cell response inducing sequences from literature. Also, more attention was given to CD4+ TCR epitopes than CD8+. Since the former sequences were found to be more stable than the other as per studies on patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The designed sequence had 5 epitopes joined by linkers as cytoplasmic region. Among these, at least two epitopes were found folded after model building for the sequence without trans-membrane domain. As more well-formed structural epitopes can ensure more CD4+ T-cell activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> to cause persistent immunity. Lastly the structure was validated using the molecular dynamics simulation of 100ns time. Thus, we propose that this sequences and structures provided by our strategy could be quite useful and should be considered for vaccine design and development against SARS-COV-2 and can also be tweaked to any other future variants or viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P4">The complete workflow of the current study is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure1</xref>.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Sequences retrieval</title><p id="P5">The <italic>SARS-1</italic> and <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> spike sequences were retrieved from the UniProt database with accession no.

At first, sequences corresponding to coronaviruses infecting all host animals were considered. For nucleocapsid sequences, we found out inclusion of MERS nucleocapsid generates a distinct tree which slowly departs from other corona including SARS-COV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 2A</xref>). Further, we generated circular tree by filtering out gapped sequences, protein fragments and non-human host infecting corona viruses. This confirmed that MERS nucleocapsid protein sequences indeed form a distinct tree, but by being more conserved as compared to others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 2B</xref>). In fact, it did not even change much within the MERS family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 2B</xref>). Usually, nucleocapsid protein is highly conserved than spike and more immunogenic. It is also essential for maintaining RNA structure, packaging inside viral particle. If random mutations arise in nucleocapsid, virus will not survive in long run. Taking this MERS scenario, introduction of recurrent random mutations in nucleocapsid protein (by immunological perspective) may be beneficial for vaccine design. Although, SARS-COV-2 (SARS-2) nucleocapsid has more mutations than MERS, still the frequency is much low compared to spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Alongside we also generated similar sequence-similarity trees with other structural proteins (Spike, Membrane and Envelope) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S1, S2 and S3</xref>). The focus was on 2 aspects: 1) Conserved structural proteins among living corona viruses (MERS, SARS-COV-2 and common cold corona viruses; not SARS as it is already extinct by natural immunity); 2) How immunogenic these proteins are. There we found out that envelope protein also can be a suitable candidate like nucleocapsid. These protein sequences were highly conserved among SARS-COV-2 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, we have taken one non-allergenic epitope from envelope protein which is important for binding to human cell junction proteins and has robust immune response. Surprisingly, spike protein sequences were also found highly conserved among MERS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). As already chosen in existing vaccine candidates including our design, not much study was done on this further. Membrane protein (M) was found highly conserved among extinct SARS strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) and immunologically less persistent (described below), therefore not chosen.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Literature hunting for potential T-cell epitopes for vaccine design</title><p id="P16">Immunogenic sequences of COVID nucleocapsid protein and envelope protein were carefully shortlisted from literature studies. Initially, the attention was on the sequences with overlapping CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes. Similarity with common cold viral sequences were also taken into consideration. The data available from recovered patient and asymptomatic population were given highest importance. Final chosen peptides were screened based on their structures (from PDBsum) or from secondary structure predicted by Phyre2 server (in absence of PDB for envelope protein; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). As known, SARS-2 CD8+ epitopes are hotspots of nonsynonymous mutations to cause short-lived immunity. Since CD8+ epitopes are mostly unstructured, special consideration was made to choose epitopes with definite structures to attract CD4 based immunity. Subsequently, two epitopes were found folded in Alpha Fold. For the rest, we found one epitope fully and another partially non-structural after validation in Alpha Fold (described below). They were kept in the final construct based on their ability to provoke instantaneous immune response due to high similarity with common cold and strong memory response. Membrane protein epitopes were found to be less persistent as per the literature study with exception of highly COVID-exposed hospital workers who are more immune to COVID than any other population. The chosen peptides are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>RoseTTAFold building and structure validation in AlphaFold</title><p id="P17">The designed sequence had signal peptide, transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain formed by T-cell epitopes interconnected by EAAAK linker. Major stabilizing portion of putative ADCC/ADE region and core β-strand were removed. The resulting local disorder in remaining ADE segment after deletion was confirmed from analysis in AlphaFold-disorder package (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>) which can predict residue fluctuations from pLDDT values and relative solvent accessibility (RSA) calculated. The positively charged Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit signal from COVID native spike was placed at the cytoplasmic end to facilitate easy exit from ER. This sequence was first modelled in RoseTTAFold and found to be structurally similar to native spike all domains including cytoplasmic domain are distinctly well formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 7</xref>). To validate further, we have modelled in Alpha Fold for two sequences: with and without transmembrane (ΔTM) region. It was seen the at least two epitopes (NFGDQELIRQGTDYKHWPQIAQFAPSASAFFGMSR and FYVYSRVKNLNSSRV) were folded in ΔTM sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 8</xref>). While first sequence is well folded in the TM+ (with transmembrane) construct, but not the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 10</xref>). It appears the first sequence is the major driver of folding for the designed cytoplasmic domain. Also, inter-residual distance analysis in PyMOL showed longer distance (21 Å) between this peptide and last sequence or memory epitope (QVILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKKADET) in TM+ construct than the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 9</xref>). The other peptide (DLSPRWYFYYLGTGP) and memory epitope are fully unstructured in TM+ construct. Memory epitope is partially structured in ΔTM possibly due to closer distance (8.5 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 11A</xref>) to folding driver peptide. Seemingly, this closeness is resulted from absence of transmembrane domain in ΔTM which otherwise pulled away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 9B</xref>) the folding driver epitope from memory epitope in TM+ model. This might have caused unstructured memory peptide in TM+ construct. In fact, both TM+ model and native spike (having transmembrane region) have shown mostly unstructured cytoplasmic domain which is further validated by PAE scores similarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S9, S10</xref>) in this domain for these two models. For the main protein, the receptor binding doman (RBD) is found to be well folded and identical among all three models including native spike (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Also, the core β-strand is replaced by two discontinuous stretches of β-strands which can form hydrogen bonds with the complementary strand in the core β-sheet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Thereby, the structural integrity of this region can be maintained. Although, the lengths of these strands are not enough to support pre- to post fusion transition of spike unlike native core β-strand.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Design Validation through Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><p id="P18">One of the challenges of de novo design of anti-variant COVID-19 vaccines is to ensure that they elicit robust and long-lasting T-cell memory response. In this study we further validated the AlphaFold designs in a 100ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and analyzed various parameters of root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and radius of gyration (Rg) and assessed the structural stability and dynamics of the design. These parameters can provide insights into the conformational changes, flexibility, and compactness of the structures over time and indicating stable design. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 11A</xref> shows the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) plot of the protein backbone atoms as a function of time. The RMSD is a measure of how much the protein structure deviates from a reference structure, usually the initial or native structure. The initial RMSD value at 5.30 ns was 5.09 Å, indicating a large deviation from the starting structure. This could be due to the initial equilibration of the system and the relaxation of the protein conformation. After that, the RMSD values decreased and fluctuated around an average value of 3.47 Å, suggesting that the protein reached a stable conformation and did not undergo significant structural changes during the rest of the simulation. The protein structure is determined by a balance of different forces, including covalent bonds, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic interactions are caused by the presence of charged or polar residues on the protein surface or in the interior. Electrostatic interactions can affect protein structure in several ways. They can stabilize or destabilize the protein fold by forming favourable or unfavourable interactions with other residues or with the solvent molecules. They can also modulate the flexibility and dynamics of the protein by influencing the rigidity or mobility of certain regions or domains. The histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">figure 11B</xref> shows the electrostatic interaction values between −0.3 for the protein structure at 100ns time. The electrostatic interaction value is calculated as the sum of Coulombic interactions between all pairs of charged or polar atoms in the protein, divided by the number of atoms. A more negative value indicates the overall attractive, while a positive value indicates an overall repulsive. The histogram shows that most of the electrostatic interaction values are close to zero, indicating that there is a balance between attractive and repulsive interactions in the protein structure. However, there are some outliers with more negative values, indicating that these regions or residues have somewhat stronger electrostatic interactions than others. These residues with more negative values may be involved in stabilizing salt bridges or H-bonds with other residues and region and they could be more rigid or flexible than others, affecting their conformational changes or dynamics at 100ns of time trajectory. The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis is a method to measure the flexibility of different regions of a molecular structure over time. It can reveal the more stable or high dynamic residues or regions of the structure contributing during molecular dynamics simulations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 12A</xref> shows the RMSF values of each residue along the protein sequence. The residues with higher RMSF values are coloured in red, indicating that they are more flexible than the residues with lower RMSF values, which are coloured in grey. The most flexible residue is 1246-, with an RMSF value of 14.48 Å and is located at the C-terminus of the protein, which is expected to be more mobile than the rest of the structure residues. In addition, the C-terminal region, starting from 1160-THR to the end, has an overall high RMSF value, suggesting that it is very flexible region. Also, average RMSF value of 3.69 Å for overall structure in 100ns time of simulations. This can also be seen in the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 12B</xref>, which shows the distribution of RMSF values indicating the significance of the c-terminal region in terms of flexibility and conformational transitions. The radius of gyration (Rg) is a measure of how the atoms of a protein are distributed around its centre of mass. The smaller the Rg, the more compact the protein structure is. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">figure 13A-B</xref>, the Rg of the protein was calculated for each frame of a 100ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The highest value was 20.59 Å and the average value was 20.33 Å, indicating that the protein maintained a relatively compact conformation throughout the simulation. To visualize the structural changes over time, we plotted the time-based gradients of the structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">figure 14</xref>, where the blue colour represents the initial structure, and the red colour represents the final structure. The structure underwent shrinkage during the simulation, which could be due to the formation or stabilization of intra- or inter-molecular interactions. The three-dimensional representation of the protein structure at different time points during the simulation can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 14</xref>. The structures are aligned by their centres of mass and coloured according to their time order. The blue structure corresponds to the initial conformation at 0 ns, while the red structure corresponds to the final conformation at 100 ns. The intermediate structures are coloured with a gradient from blue to red, indicating their relative position in time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this study we applied computational design and simulation of two vaccine structures with potential to overcome SARS-CoV-2. The other conserved structural proteins along with spike were targeted for these potential vaccine constructs. These structures were further validated via 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Our vaccine constructs are designed based on SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins’ T-cell evoking epitopes screened from literature. The hallmark of current COVID19 vaccination is wild type spike protein because of its potent antigenicity. But the presence of vaccine evading variants and mutations led us to incorporate the mutant spike in our design. For e.g. the deadly delta variant from pre-vaccination era was followed by milder omicron variants after mass vaccination. This massive paradigm shift in viral strains predicted future variants will be more likely recombinants to evade vaccine elicited immunity. Therefore, hybrid spike sequence with both delta and omicron mutations is important for the potential design of vaccine candidates which we achieved in our design. Furthermore, spike protein’s S2 segment has regions which do not generate neutralizing antibodies and do not have dominant T cell response. There is also a short cytoplasmic domain. Our designs replaced it by inserting COVID’s T cell epitopes interconnected by non-immunogenic, helical &amp; rigid linker sequence EAAAK. To incorporate all these linkers, we also have removed segments of core β-strand (buried deep inside spike core, structurally dispensable in pre-fusion spike and immunologically less significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 6</xref>) from the S2 region of spike. This can significantly be useful in the design to add a new segment to the full molecule without making it larger in size and conformation to reduce the cost and time of synthesizability. Additionally, the absence of this region can prevent the spike to go from pre- to post fusion conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, standard proline-proline (non-viral sequence) insertion which is used in other spike-based vaccines is not considered including the putative region in S1 which caused ADE responses in SARS as per literature study and structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 5B</xref>). The selection of T- epitopes to build cytoplasmic domain, non-allergenic peptides among nucleocapsid’s numerous T cell epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 3</xref>) were enlisted including memory peptide which helps in eliciting strong immune responses in recovered and vaccinated patients. These sequences are also highly similar to other common cold coronavirus (HuCoV) nucleocapsid protein sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 1</xref>). As all humans have immune response against HuCoV from childhood driven by pulmonary immune memory including CD4+ epitopes. Interestingly, using these epitopes has an advantage to generate long term and quick immune response. This establishes their importance in persistent immunity. Whether the selected peptides cause misfolding in the generated construct or not, the PDBsum analysis helped to screen nucleocapsid peptides which were found to fold with correct secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 3B</xref>). For envelope peptide without any PDB structure, we have relied on Phyre2 result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Later model building in RosettaFold showed these peptides as alpha-helical in the designed cytoplasmic domain of the construct. Final Alpha Fold model building predicted that at least two peptides are folded while the other two epitopes are mostly unstructured in construct without transmembrane region. One of the folded epitopes can be the main player in folding for other subsequent peptides. The predicted LDDT values were &gt;70 for this epitope in both ΔTM and +TM sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 10</xref>). Also, we found out that the transmembrane domain pulls the adjacent region including the abovementioned principal epitope for folding in cytoplasmic domain from the other portions in +TM construct. The resulting distance between last epitope and folding driver epitope is much more in +TM construct than ΔTM construct. Interestingly, the folding driver peptide was constructed by joining numerous CD4+ and CD8+ responsive N-peptides from immunological studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). In native Nucleocapsid protein, they are located as flanked to each other, parsed by immune system as numerous small peptides. Apart from immunological significance, they might play a role in folding of native nucleocapsid around viral RNA. Parallel molecular dynamics in 100ns simulation time revealed stable conformations of the design structures in terms of RMSD, initially higher and then onwards much more stable and very flexible C-terminal region in the RMSF. Furthermore, Rg and time based-gradient analysis revealed a compact system suggesting overall conformational stability of the design structures and less mobility or fluctuation transitions except highly flexible C-terminal regions (which otherwise will be fragmented by immune systems once recognized as potential epitopes).</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P20">Given the utmost need for potential vaccines against deadly SARS-CoV-2 pathogen candidate recently an emergency left by WHO, our study provides comprehensive in-silico strategy to design vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using the long-lasting potent T-cell immune memory strategy. Our strategy proposes that the ΔTM construct with linker joined cytoplasmic epitopes can be a potential vaccine construct against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 (VOC) including extending its capability further against the future evolving variants which is further validated in a 100ns simulations revealing the stable overall conformations and less structure mobility or fluctuation transitions. Hence this strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 (VOC) but can easily be replicated for other viruses with potential to cause pandemic such as Monkey pox, influenza, respiratory syncytial, dengue and other pox related viruses. Our study provides new insights and a comprehensive in silco protocol for long-lasting potent T-cell immune memory by considering a significant set of mutations from SARS-CoV-2 (VOCs) in the vaccine constructs. Furthermore, in-vivo, and in-vitro validation of the vaccine construct and other analysis are necessary which is lacking in this study including the incorporation of hotspot residues of spike protein of other variants and variants of concern to design a pan coronavirus vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS161492-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAdGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Fig S1 (Enlarged)</label><media xlink:href="EMS161492-supplement-Supplementary_Fig_S1__Enlarged_.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAdGcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Fig. S 1-11</label><media xlink:href="EMS161492-supplement-Supplementary_Fig__S_1_11.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d11aAdGdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Alpha Fold modelling was enabled by resources in project [SNIC 2022/22-709] provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at UPPMAX, partially funded by the Swedish Research Council through grant agreement no. 2018-05973.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Funding information</title><p>This work is not funded.</p></sec></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P21"><bold>Authors contribution</bold></p><p id="P22">AG and MMG planned the study and vaccine designs.
