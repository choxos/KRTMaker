However, the vaccines so far approved are all based on whole-virus, which raises safety concerns. MRNA vaccines has demonstrated its high efficacy and safety against SARS-Cov-2 infection. Here, we developed three mRNA vaccines encoding Monkeypox proteins M1R and A35R, including A35R-M1R fusions (VGPox1 and VGPox 2) and a combination of encapsulated full-length mRNAs for A35R and M1R (VGPox 3). All three vaccines induced anti-A35R total IgGs as early as day 7 following a single vaccination. However, only VGPox 1 and 2 produced anti-M1R total IgGs at early dates following vaccination while VGPox 3 did not show significant anti-M1R antibody till day 35. Similar results were also found in neutralizing antibodies and T cell immune response. However, all mRNA vaccine groups completely protected mice from a lethal dose virus challenge and effectively cleared virus in lungs. Collectively, our results indicate that the novel mRNA vaccines coding for a fusion protein of A35R and M1R had a better anti-virus immunity than co-expression of the two individual proteins. The mRNA vaccines are highly effective and can be an alternative to the current whole-virus vaccines to defend Monkeypox virus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Monkeypox virus</kwd><kwd>M1R</kwd><kwd>A35R</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Monkeypox virus (MPXV) belongs to the Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) genus of the Poxviridae family, which also includes variola virus (smallpox) and vaccinia virus (VACV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">McCollum and Damon, 2014</xref>). Outbreaks of the variola virus had caused millions of deaths in the world till its global eradication in 1980, thanks to the worldwide vaccination with live virus preparations of the infectious vaccinia viruses.</p><p id="P4">On July 23, 2022, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox outbreak as a global health emergency due to increased cases of Monkeypox infection world-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">See, 2022</xref>). The cease of smallpox vaccination might be one of the reasons causing the current outbreak of MPXV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Reynolds and Damon, 2012</xref>) since the two viruses share highly homologous genomes and their antibodies have showed significant cross-protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gilchuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hooper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Mucker et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, there are three pox vaccines available: ACAM2000, a live VACV vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Nalca and Zumbrun, 2010</xref>), Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Volz and Sutter, 2017</xref>) and JYNNEOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Frey et al., 2014</xref>). The JYNNEOS has been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration being the main vaccine during this monkeypox outbreak in US.</p><p id="P5">The vaccinia virus vaccines are replication-deficient in human cells. However, live virus vaccines express many viral proteins. Most of them are still lack of understanding for their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Antoine et al., 1998</xref>). The attenuated virus vaccines, therefore, remain some safety concerns, especially in immune-deficiency people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Casey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Copeman and Wallace, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Lane et al., 1969</xref>).</p><p id="P6">There are two mainly infectious forms of MPXV: extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) and intracellular mature virus (IMV). Subunit vaccines that use selected recombinant viral proteins from EEV and IMV may have better safety than the live virus vaccines. Vaccination with the E. coli-expressed A27L, a truncated IMV surface protein, protected mice from a lethal challenge of VACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Lai et al., 1991</xref>). Vaccination with recombinant viral EEV proteins B5R or A33R also protected mice from lethal challenge of smallpox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Galmiche et al., 1999</xref>). Hooper et al. found that mice vaccination with DNA encoding L1R (an IMV protein) and A33R induced neutralizing antibodies against L1R and IgGs against A33R. Combination of the above two genes was more effective than either gene alone in protecting mice against lethal challenge of VACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hooper et al., 2000</xref>). They also found vaccination with DNA encoding vaccinia virus genes (L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R) protected rhesus macaques from severe disease post the lethal challenge of MPXV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hooper et al., 2004</xref>). However, Kaufman et al. found adenovirus-expressing L1R effectively protected mice from a lethal systematic infection and behaved better than the combination of L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R while both L1R and A33R are required against intranasal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Kaufman et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, selection of viral antigens and combination strategies for better vaccine protection against the MPXV remain to be explored.</p><p id="P7">Since the overwhelming success of mRNA vaccine in defeating SARS-Cov-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Polack et al., 2020</xref>), mRNA vaccines with lipid nanoparticle delivery system have raised great interest. The benefits of mRNA include it is fast to produce in cell-free system, no risk of host genomic integration and can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, we have developed mRNA vaccines expressing MPXV EEV protein A35R (homolog of A33R in VACV) and an IMV protein M1R (homolog of L1R in VACV). Those vaccines were tested for their humoral and cellular anti-VACV immunity as well as their protection against the lethal dose of viral infection in mice. We found that novel mRNA vaccines expressing a fusion protein composed of a truncated form of A35R and a full length M1R can provide strong immunity and protection against the poxvirus.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines and virus</title><p id="P8">Vero cells and 293T cells were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in routine complete dulbecco’s modified eagle medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin &amp; streptomycin.

VGPox 1 and 2 are both single mRNA molecule coding a fusion protein composed of extracellular domain of A35R and a full length M1R, but VGPox 3 contains the mixture of two individual mRNA-LNP complexes coding the A35R and M1R, respectively. The only difference between VGPox 1 and 2 is that the latter further deleted the stalk region of A35R. Our results showed that VGPox 1 and 2 induced much higher antibody levels against M1R than co-expressing the two full-length proteins (VGPox 3) at early time points although the three vaccines produced similar levels of antibodies for A35R. Interestingly, only VGPox 1 and 2 but not VGPox 3 vaccinated sera could neutralize live virus at early time points. Since IMV is the most abundant form of viral particles, it may not be surprised that VGPox 3 vaccine that does not induce high levels of anti-M1R antibodies is not effective for the in vitro neutralization assay.</p><p id="P25">Comparing between VGPox 1 and 2, VGPox 2 showed higher levels of total IgG against M1R than VGPox 1 and VGPox 3 at all-time points. We noticed that VGPox1 had lower protein expression level than VGPox 2 in 293T cells measured by both anti-A35R and anti-M1R antibodies. This was also confirmed by another anti-A35R antibody (data not shown). It is not clear how much the difference in protein expression level contribute to the different levels of IgGs induced by the two vaccines.</p><p id="P26">The most striking results of our current study is that the mRNA coding for the fusion forms of A35R and M1R (VGPox 1 and VGPox 2) can effectively induce high levels of both A35R and M1R IgGs and are highly effective in neutralizing live virus infection in cell cultures, but not the mixture of the two individual mRNAs (VGPox 3). VGPox 3 produced M1R specific antibodies much later, and consequently the sera collected at an early time points was not able to neutralize the virus.</p><p id="P27">Nevertheless, all three mRNA vaccines (VGPox 1-3) are 100% protective in the virus challenge assay. We speculate that this is because that all animals in the current study were challenged with live virus at day 36 when both anti-A35R and anti-M1R neutralizing antibodies were present in all three vaccines. Since neutralizing antibodies against EEV and IMV may be both needed for protection of virus challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gilchuk et al., 2016</xref>), it remains to be investigated whether VGPox 1 and VGPox 2 have better protection than VGPox 3 when virus challenge is performed at an earlier time point when the anti-M1R antibodies have not been induced by VGPox 3 vaccine.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, our study demonstrated a novel mRNA vaccine expressing a fusion protein composed of monkeypox A35R extracellular domain and M1R can effectively induce both humoral and cellular immunity against the virus, demonstrating a complete protection for the mice with lethal vaccinia virus challenge. Given the high homology of vaccinia and monkeypox, our results suggest that VGPox 1 or 2 can be potential mRNA vaccines against monkeypox.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="FN2"><p id="P29"><bold>Conflict of interest statement</bold>: YTZ and XMY are employees of CNBG or its subsidiary companies.
