A subgroup of high-risk patients is characterized by aberrations in the chromatin remodeller ATRX that is encoded by 35 exons. In contrast to other pediatric cancer where <italic>ATRX</italic> point mutations are most frequent, multi-exon deletions (MEDs) are the most frequent type of <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations in neuroblastoma. Of these MEDs 75% are predicted to produce in-frame fusion proteins, suggesting a potential gain-of-function effect compared to nonsense mutations. For neuroblastoma there are only a few patient-derived <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant models. Therefore, we created isogenic <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant models using CRISPR-Cas9 in several neuroblastoma cell lines and one tumoroid and performed total RNA-sequencing on these and on the patient-derived model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed decreased expression of genes related to both ribosome biogenesis and several metabolic process in our isogenic <italic>ATRX</italic> exon 2-10 MED model systems, the patient-derived MED models and in tumor data containing two patients with an <italic>ATRX</italic> exon 2-10 MED. Interestingly, for our isogenic <italic>ATRX</italic> knock-out and exon 2-13 MED models GSEA revealed an opposite expression pattern characterized by increased expression of genes related to ribosome biogenesis and several metabolic process. Our validations confirmed a potential role of <italic>ATRX</italic> in the regulation of ribosome homeostasis. In this manner we identified two distinct molecular expression patterns within <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant neuroblastomas with important implications for the need of distinct treatment regimens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in pediatric cancer and arises during the development of fetal adrenal neuroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In recent years, the survival rates have improved to 81% for neuroblastoma in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, the survival for high-risk patients remains only 50% despite intensive treatment. Recent data has shown that high-risk patients can be stratified in four genetic subgroups: <italic>MYCN</italic> amplified, <italic>TERT</italic> rearranged, <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant or none of these three aberrations, in which <italic>MYCN</italic> amplifications and <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations are mutually exclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. <italic>ATRX</italic> is a commonly mutated gene in pediatric cancer and its precise molecular role in neuroblastoma development is still unclear.</p><p id="P3">The chromatin remodeler ATRX is encoded by 35 exons localized on the X-chromosome and is involved in a plethora of nuclear processes. Its most prominent role is the chromatin incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 together with its binding partner DAXX to maintain genomic integrity and a heterochromatin state at pericentromeric and telomeric regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations are associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. ALT is a telomerase-independent telomeric maintenance mechanism. This mechanism is a homologous recombination-based process that is still poorly understood. A currently untested theory is that the deposition of H3.3 at telomeric regions is necessary to prevent formation of G-quadruplexes to limit the amount of fork collapse and concomitantly double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. It is suggested that the process of ALT occurs due to the faulty and altered repair of these induced DSBs. Many tumors displaying ALT have <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations, however several <italic>ATRX</italic> wild-type tumors also display ALT and how ATRX aberration contribute to ALT is currently unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, the precise role of ATRX within the development of ALT has not yet been elucidated.</p><p id="P4">Previously, we have shown that <italic>ATRX</italic> multi-exon deletions (MEDs) are almost exclusively present in neuroblastoma whereas other pediatric cancers are dominated by point mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Of these MEDs 75% are predicted to be in-frame and for the most common MEDs it has been shown that these still result in protein production, suggesting a potential gain-of-function effect compared to wild-type. So far 30 unique <italic>ATRX</italic> MEDs have been reported in neuroblastoma, of which only three constitute the far majority of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Many of these 30 unique MEDs lack a large part of the N-terminal region including exons 8-9. Furthermore, several rare MEDs have been identified that lack a smaller part of the gene including exons 11-12, which contains the DAXX-binding domain. In neuroblastoma only very few patient-derived models exists and the deletions that are present only represent a small fraction of the deletions that are present in patients, while for nonsense and missense mutations there are no model systems at all. Nonsense, missense and distinct <italic>ATRX</italic> deletions could be molecularly very different and therefore might need distinct therapies.</p><p id="P5">In order to study the molecular role of different <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations in neuroblastoma, we created isogenic ATRX knock-out (KO) and several distinct in-frame MEDs, including some rare deletions, in neuroblastoma cell line and organoid models. Gene expression analysis was conducted for all generated models and for three patient-derived <italic>ATRX</italic> MED models. We were able to identify the presence of two opposing molecular expression profiles for different <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of neuroblastoma cell lines with <italic>ATRX</italic> multi-exon deletions</title><p id="P6">To study the role of ATRX aberrations in neuroblastoma development, we acquired two classical neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-MM and CHLA-90, and the tumoroid AMC772T2 that we previously established in our lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We first validated the genomic aberrations of these three <italic>ATRX</italic> MED models using a PCR-based assay on cDNA, since the exact DNA breakpoint within the introns are unknown. For the male cell line CHLA-90 we identified transcripts confirming a genomic deletion of exon 3-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. For the female cell line SK-N-MM we confirmed the nonsense mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1A</xref>; K1367*) as described by Qadeer et al, and we identified transcripts containing exon 2-9 and exon 2-10 MEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This indicates that on the genomic level there is a deletion of exons 2-9, which is predicted to be out-of-frame. However, by skipping exon 10, in-frame transcripts are generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. For the tumoroid AMC772T2 that is derived from a male patient we found both exon 2-9 and exon 2-10 MED transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating an exon 2-9 MED on the genomic level. Thus, our patient-derived models contain <italic>ATRX</italic> MEDs on the genomic and transcriptomic level.</p><p id="P7">Subsequently, we assessed the protein expression of ATRX utilizing an antibody against the C-terminus that recognizes both full-length and in-frame fusion (IFF) ATRX protein products. We detected full-length ATRX protein (280 kDa) for SK-N-AS, LAN-6, and SK-N-FI (control cell lines) and ATRX IFF protein (~140-150 kDa) for CHLA-90, SK-N-MM and AMC772T2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In all three <italic>ATRX</italic> models multiple key proteins domains are lost, including the nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we assessed protein localization using fractionation western blot experiments, in which we detected a strong retention of IFF proteins in the cytosol with minimal amounts in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, in the ATRX wild-type cell line SK-N-SH we observe equal amounts of full-length protein in both fractions. Lastly, we assessed the localization of ATRX to heterochromatic foci together with its binding partner HP1α that marks pericentric heterochromatic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In the ATRX wild-type cell line GI-ME-N we observe clear ATRX foci that co-localize with HP1α foci, while in all three patient-derived <italic>ATRX</italic> MED models (PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup>) we observe diffuse ATRX staining and absence of ATRX foci (S1). Thus, ATRX MEDs are expressed on the protein level, but are strongly retained in the cytosol and no longer form ATRX nuclear foci.</p><p id="P8">ATRX aberrations are strongly associated with ALT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and therefore we employed two assays to confirm this ALT phenotype within our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models. Our ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) staining confirmed the presence of ALT in all three PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models, in which we observe strong telomeric staining that co-localizes with PML protein (S2). On the telomeric southern blot we observed extremely long and heterogeneous telomeric length in our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models as well as in two additional ALT models (SK-N-FI and LAN-6, both <italic>ATRX</italic> wild-type), but not in SK-N-SH (S3A). In conclusion, we confirmed the presence of ALT in our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models.</p><p id="P9">ATRX is involved in prometaphase to metaphase transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and in the removal of G-quadruplexes and R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These secondary DNA structures hinder progression of replication, which might lead to replication-fork stalling and ultimately in fork collapse and increased DNA damage. Knock-out of <italic>ATRX</italic> has been shown to result in both prolonged mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the latter as a result of increased replication stress. However, we do not observe an increased proportion of cells in S or G2/M phase in our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models compared to wild-type models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also do not observe changes in the rate of proliferation compared to wild-type cells (S3B). Previously, it has been reported that <italic>ATRX</italic> knock-out leads to increased DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, we only found increased DNA damage in two of the three PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, we were unable to detect ATRX-specific disturbances in cell cycle progression and no clear association between <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations and the level of DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Generation and validation of ATRX aberrant isogenic cell lines/tumoroids</title><p id="P10">Currently, only very few <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant models are available, and they only represent a small fraction of all observed <italic>ATRX</italic> patient aberrations. Therefore, we made isogenic model systems, which have the additional advantage of the presence of a reference mother-line. To create <italic>ATRX</italic> KO models, that represent <italic>ATRX</italic> nonsense mutations, we used a CRISPR guide targeting exon 4 and a plasmid containing homology-arms to knock-in a GFP puromycin construct for selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). After selection, cells were sorted to generate single-cell clones. To generate large MEDs we used two CRISPR guides targeting the flanking intronic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2B</xref>) and generated single-cell clones by sorting on GFP-positive cells. We generated the most common MED of exon 2-10, the rare MED of exon 2-13 and the rare MED of exon 10-12 (for more information about all observed MED in literature see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>). We attempted to create both <italic>ATRX</italic> KO and <italic>ATRX</italic> MEDs in several cell lines, an overview of our (un)successful attempts can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> and protein confirmation is shown in S4A. Thus, in the end we established a total of 20 <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant isogenic clones.</p><p id="P11">To further validate the isogenic models, we performed the same experiments as on our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models. For all our isogenic MED models of exons 2-10 and 2-13 we detected cytosolic retention of ATRX IFF proteins and diffuse ATRX staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6-8</xref>), similarly to what we observed in the PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models. Also diffuse ATRX staining was observed for the NB139 exon 10-12 MED model. This might indicate that the loss of the DAXX binding domain in this model in sufficient to disturb ATRX localization to pericentric heterochromatin. In contrast, we could not identify any signs of ALT in our isogenic models by APBs stainings (S9-11) and telomeric southern blot analysis (S4B). This could indicate that ALT is depending on a more complex genomic background and is in line with earlier reports showing that inducing <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations does not necessarily result in ALT activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast to our PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models, we do observe a larger fraction of cells in both S and G2/M phase and fewer cells in GO/G1 in all our <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant GI-ME-N models compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, we observed unchanged proliferation rates for all <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant GI-ME-N models (S5B). Suggesting that only the fractions of cells undergoing proliferation increased, but not the rate of proliferation. For our NB139 <italic>ATRX</italic> MED of exon 2-10 we observed changes in both cell cycle and proliferation. However, instead of increased S and G2/M and decreased G0/G1 that we observed for our isogenic <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant GI-ME-N models, we observed the opposite in our NB139 exon 2-10 MED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we observe more cells with a stronger violet trace signal compared to wild-type, indicating a decreased rate of cell proliferation (S5C). On the contrary we do not observe any changes in our isogenic SK-N-AS <italic>ATRX</italic> KO models for cell cycle or proliferation (S5A and D). Lastly, we assessed the amount of DSBs in our isogenic models but did not observe increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4C</xref>), not even upon induction by radiation in our GI-ME-N models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). In summary, our created isogenic models recapitulated some of the phenotypes observed in the PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models, however the effect of <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations on cell cycle might be cell line/type dependent.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Strong overlap of differentially expressed genes between ATRX<sup>Δ2-13</sup> and ATRX<sup>-/-</sup> GI-ME-N models</title><p id="P12">To study the molecular landscape of ATRX aberrant neuroblastoma we assessed the transcriptomes by performing total RNA-sequencing. When we performed PCA of all isogenic models we observe separation based on the mother-lines (S12A). From the PCA of GI-ME-N, SK-N-AS and NB139 we can observe nice separation of wild-type versus <italic>ATRX</italic> mutant clones (S12B-D). Only for GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-13</sup> clone 15 we observed clustering with the GI-ME-N<sup>-/-</sup> clones that we could not explain.</p><p id="P13">We performed differential expression analyses for SK-N-AS<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>(ATRX</italic> KO), GI-ME-N<sup>-/-</sup>, GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-10</sup> <italic>(ATRX</italic> MED exon 2-10), GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-13</sup> and NB139<sup>Δ2-10</sup> compared to corresponding wild-type clones. Several thousands of genes were differentially expressed in each of the 5 expression analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). To determine if the different <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations resulted in similar changes in gene expression we took the overlap of both the down and upregulated genes within the GI-ME-N models. We noticed a striking overlap between GI-ME-N<sup>-/-</sup> and GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-13</sup> and very little overlap with GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-10</sup>, indicating that there might be two distinct expression patterns within <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant GI-ME-N models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, suggesting one expression pattern related to complete inactivation of ATRX (GI-ME-N<sup>-/-</sup> and GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-13</sup>) and one related to the IFF with remaining or gained protein activity (GI-ME-<sub>N</sub><sup>Δ2-10</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gene ontology reveals increased expression of genes related to metabolic process in ATRX<sup>Δ2-13</sup> and ATRX<sup>-/-</sup> models and decreased expression in ATRX<sup>Δ2-10</sup> models</title><p id="P14">To further study this hypothesis, we looked at the overlapping down- and upregulated genes between all KO and <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-13</sup> models and performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on those genes. GO analysis of the 227 overlapping downregulated genes showed enrichment for the regulation of several RNA and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), while for the upregulated genes we found an overlap of 142 genes that are enriched for seven processes involved in metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, GO analysis of the 618 overlapping downregulated genes for our <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models identified these same seven metabolic processes and also several other terms involved in other metabolic and RNA processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13</xref>). While GO analysis of the 635 overlapping upregulated genes for our <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models showed enrichment for process involved in biological quality and localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In all four comparisons between the overlapping differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>), we also noticed many non-overlapping genes that are only differentially expressed within one cell line model. This might be explained by the fact that ATRX is a chromatin remodeller and that the effects of <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations are highly dependent on the epigenetic landscape that is already present in the distinct cell lines.</p><p id="P15">ATRX is known to bind at the 3′ exon of zinc finger genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> were it could potentially modulate their expression. Therefore, we performed panther protein class analysis for the overlapping up and down-regulated genes for both the <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-13</sup> models and for the <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models. Only for the downregulated genes of both we found significant terms, namely zinc finger transcription factors for our <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-13</sup> models (S12G) and proteins involved in RNA processes and translation in <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models (S12H). Altogether, we can conclude that two distinct expression profiles are present within <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant neuroblastoma that seem to lead to opposing changes in metabolic processes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>GSEA reveals two opposing expression patterns within <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant neuroblastoma</title><p id="P16">To acquire more understanding of the changed biological processes we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for all isogenic model systems. Additionally, we also performed GSEA for the comparison of PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models with five <italic>non-MYCN</italic> amplified neuroblastoma cell lines (S12E, for number of DEGs see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) and for the comparison of neuroblastoma tumors from the individualized THERapy (iTHER) project. The iTHER data contains 2 tumors with an <italic>ATRX</italic> MED of exon 2-10 (iTHER<sup>Δ2-10</sup>) and 7 <italic>ATRX</italic> wild-type and <italic>non-MYCN</italic> amplified tumors (S12F, for number of DEGs see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Thus, in total we performed 7 GSEA for both the gene set database gene ontology biological process (GO BP) and Reactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The majority of neuroblastoma patients have a MED of exon 2-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and therefore we visualized all the overlapping significantly changed genes sets with the same Normalised Enrichment Score (NES) directionality (e.g. - or +) between GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-10</sup>, NB139<sup>Δ2-10</sup>, PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> and iTHER<sup>Δ2-10</sup> in bubble plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our bubble plot of all the overlapping significant GO BP gene sets shows decreased expression of genes related to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and metabolism in these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S14B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">E-G</xref>). While we observe the complete opposite patterns for GI-ME-N<sup>-/-</sup>, SK-N-AS<sup>-/-</sup> and GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-13</sup>, which is in line with our GO analysis results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C-D</xref>). This pattern is confirmed by the comparisons of the GSEA of Reactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, this suggests two opposing expression profiles within <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant neuroblastoma.</p><p id="P17">In the paper of McDowell et al., 1999 it was reported that ATRX binds to the short arm of acrocentric chromosomes were rDNA copies are localised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>,which together with our GSEA data might suggest a role of ATRX in ribosomal biogenesis. Interestingly, we also observed multiple GO BP gene sets in our GSEA related to cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrial translation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These GO BP gene sets are all dependent on the abundance of ribosomes, since a reduction or increase in the amount of ribosomes leads to reduced or increased translation capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and consecutively might lead to changed metabolism. Visualization of the top 50 differentially expressed ribosome biogenesis genes for all our isogenic models and cell line data shows changed expression of both small and large ribosomal proteins and also of many other proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S15A-D</xref>).

To exclude an indirect effect of ATRX on ribosome biogenesis via the expression of these genes we assessed their protein abundance. For both MYCN and c-MYC we observe unchanged expression in the isogenic model systems, while for EZH2 we observe a slight decreased in expression in the GI-ME-N<sup>Δ2-10</sup> clones and a strong decrease in the NB139<sup>Δ2-10</sup> clone (S16A). However, we also observe decreased EZH2 protein expression in SK-N-AS<sup>-/-</sup> clone 14. Additionally, we assessed the gene expression of the REST gene, which was previously reported to be overexpressed in CHLA-90 and SK-N-MM compared to LAN-6 and SK-N-FI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe this in both our cell line and tumor data (S16B-C).

We assessed the rRNA expression in our isogenic models and in the PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models by performing qPCRs on the unspliced pre-rRNA 47S.

We observed decreased rRNA expression upon doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>; two sample t-test assuming unequal variance, p = 0.068).

However, we did not observe ALT in any of our <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant isogenic model systems. The cell lines and tumoroids in which we attempted to make <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations were all telomerase-dependent and according to literature telomerase-dependent telomeric maintenance could be favored over ALT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we also attempted to KO <italic>TERT</italic> or <italic>TERC</italic> to force cells in using ALT, but no cells survived and could therefore indicate that other factors might be necessary in conjunction to induce ALT (data not shown). There is indeed evidence that inducing aberrations within the <italic>ATRX</italic> gene does not necessarily cause ALT in different cell types and cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">ATRX has been reported to be involved in cell cycle progression, since <italic>ATRX</italic> KO resulted in prolonged mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the latter as a result of increased replication stress. Interestingly, we observed this for all our <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrant isogenic GI-ME-N models, but not for our isogenic SK-N-AS and NB139 models. Additionally, we also didn't observe this in the PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models, compared to several wild-type models. The absence of changed cell cycle in our SK-N-AS <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>-/-</sup> models could potentially be attributed to the fact that this cell line is <italic>TP53</italic> mutant, which is also to case for two of the three PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models. TP53 is a major regulator of cell cycle progression and is both involved in G1/S and G2/M transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and therefore <italic>TP53</italic> aberrations can lead to removal of cell cycle blockage. This could therefore mask the effect of the <italic>ATRX</italic> KO on cell cycle in both the SK-N-AS models and the two PD<sup>ΔATRX</sup> models. An alternative explanation, for the various outcomes of <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations on cell cycle that we observed, could be that the effect of <italic>ATRX</italic> aberrations is highly cell line specific due to the presence of different chromatin and/or genetic environments.</p><p id="P23">Changed ribosome biogenesis, proliferation and metabolic process are observed in many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In this study we identified a dichotomy in ribosome biogenesis and several related metabolic processes between the <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> and the <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-13&amp;-/-</sup> (ATRX<sup>Δ2-13</sup> and <italic>ATRX<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> neuroblastoma tumor cells. Additionally, we show that rRNA expression is downregulated in <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models and upregulated in <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-13&amp;-/-</sup> models, completely in accordance with our RNA expression data. This suggests that ATRX is in involved in ribosome homeostasis either through direct or indirect modulation of ribosome biogenesis. A hint of the involvement of ATRX in ribosome biogenesis dates from 1999, when it was discovered that ATRX binds to rDNA arrays during metaphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Only very recently it was observed that ATRX binds to several proteins directly involved in ribosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Another report showed that ATRX binds to the promotor region of rDNA and that in gliomas with nonsense mutations increased ribosome biogenesis can be observed, which is in line with our generated <italic>ATRX</italic> KO models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, for the majority of our created models we did not observe changed proliferative rates, however we observed several altered metabolic processes in our data. This could suggest that the changes in ribosome biogenesis did not reach the threshold to change the proliferation rate but could have reached the threshold to rewire metabolism. There are recent indications that changes in ribosome biogenesis can directly modulate metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">In the majority of cancers high rates of ribosome biogenesis are observed and contribute to tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, for our <italic>ATRX</italic><sup>Δ2-10</sup> models we observe downregulation of ribosome biogenesis suggesting that this will lead to reduced tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, decreased ribosome biogenesis has also be shown to promote tumorigenesis as is observed for patients with ribosomopathies that are prone to the development of certain tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. It is postulated that the lower amounts of ribosomes leads to competition between various mRNAs and that tumor suppressor encoding mRNA with lower ribosomal binding affinity could lead to reduced expression of certain tumor suppressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Also, recent evidence shows that decreases and increases of specific ribosomal proteins are advantageous for tumor development and that these effects are highly cell type and tissue specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.
