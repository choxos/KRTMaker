Collections of data from healthy individuals are being integrated in cell atlases that provide a comprehensive view of cellular phenotypes in a tissue. However, it remains unclear whether atlas datasets are suitable references for disease-state identification, or whether matched control samples should be employed, to minimise false discoveries driven by biological and technical confounders. Here we quantitatively compare the use of atlas and control datasets as references for identification of disease-associated cell states, on simulations and real disease scRNA-seq datasets. We find that reliance on a single type of reference dataset introduces false positives. Conversely, using an atlas dataset as reference for latent space learning followed by differential analysis against a matched control dataset leads to precise identification of disease-associated cell states. We show that, when an atlas dataset is available, it is possible to reduce the number of control samples without increasing the rate of false discoveries. Using a cell atlas of blood cells from 12 studies to contextualise data from a case-control COVID-19 cohort, we sensitively detect cell states associated with infection, and distinguish heterogeneous pathological cell states associated with distinct clinical severities. Our analysis provides guiding principles for design of disease cohort studies and efficient use of cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">High-dimensional tissue profiling of healthy and disease samples with single-cell genomics enables the characterization of cellular phenotypes that are altered in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lindeboom, Regev and Teichmann, 2021</xref>).

Typically, cellular profiles from different conditions are first integrated into a common phenotypic latent space, matching common cell types and minimising technical differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lotfollahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Then, healthy and diseased cells in matched cell states are contrasted in differential analysis, to identify differences in gene expression patterns or in cellular composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Burkhardt <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Skinnider <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">ZHao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dann <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While the choice of method used for both steps can be impactful, appropriate selection of the healthy reference dataset is crucial for precise identification of true disease-associated states.</p><p id="P5">The profiling of collections of healthy tissue samples by the research community has enabled the generation of large, harmonised collections of data from multiple organs, leading to the rapid expansion of the Human Cell Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://data.humancellatlas.org/">http://data.humancellatlas.org/</ext-link>). Indeed, for certain tissues (e.g., lung and blood) there now exist millions of cells profiled using a variety of technologies from hundreds to thousands of individuals. Computational analyses allow these datasets to be meaningfully integrated, thus providing a comprehensive view of cell phenotypes in a tissue, while effectively minimising variation driven by experimental protocols. Nevertheless, the biological and technical characteristics of the samples included in an atlas might differ greatly from those of the disease cohort of interest. This could lead to false discoveries in differential analysis, if confounding factors are unknown or not appropriately handled in statistical testing.</p><p id="P6">Instead of using externally-generated atlases as a reference against which to compare disease samples, a matched control dataset could be used, where healthy tissue samples are selected to ‘match’ the disease samples in terms of cohort size, demographics, sample collection and processing protocols (ideally with healthy and diseased samples processed in parallel). This choice of reference minimises the risk of false positives driven by confounding effects. However, collection of a large number of healthy control samples is not always practical or possible, especially in human studies. Moreover, using a relatively small number of samples for the integration step increases the risk of missing rare cell states, and over-interpreting sample-specific noise. Understanding how the features of the reference dataset affect the ability to identify disease-associated cell states will guide effective data re-use, design of disease studies, and future cell atlasing efforts.</p><p id="P7">Here we compare the use of atlas and control datasets as references for identification of disease-associated cell states, showing that reliance on a single type of reference dataset introduces false positives. In contrast, combined use of an atlas dataset as reference for latent embedding and of a control dataset as reference for differential analysis leads to precise and sensitive identification of putative disease cell states, with important implications for both experimental design and utilisation of single-cell disease cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reference design for identification of disease-associated cell states</title><p id="P8">To optimize the selection of a reference dataset for identification of disease-associated cell states, we considered the attributes of the disease and reference datasets that are commonly jointly analysed in scRNA-seq studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). Throughout this study we use the term “cell state” to define a group of cells that are more transcriptionally similar to each other than to other cells in the same tissue - in practice a cell state might represent a neighbourhood of cells, the output of a clustering algorithm or cell type annotation. In a disease dataset, biological samples typically originate from tens of individuals from a relatively homogeneous population (e.g. recruited from the same hospital), the same experimental protocol is used across samples for dissociation, library prep and sequencing (or experiments are designed to minimise confounding with cohort-specific variables). We define a healthy reference dataset as a <italic>control</italic> if it matches the disease dataset in terms of cohort characteristics and experimental protocols. We define a reference dataset as an <italic>atlas</italic> if it aggregates data from hundreds to thousands of individuals from multiple cohorts, profiled with a variety of experimental protocols. Typically, such integrated datasets capture a larger variety of healthy cell states compared to smaller cohorts.</p><p id="P9">We consider the following workflow to identify disease-associated cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>). First, a dimensionality reduction model is trained on the dataset from healthy tissues (embedding reference dataset), to minimise batch effects while learning a latent space representative of cellular phenotypes in the tissue. Then, the model trained on the embedding reference is used to map the query dataset, including the disease samples, to the same latent space using transfer learning (TL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lotfollahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Finally, differential analysis comparing cells between disease samples and healthy samples (differential analysis reference) is used to distinguish disease-associated states. With this workflow, we identify three alternatives for selection of a reference dataset (<italic>reference design</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>): i) the atlas reference design (AR design) or ii) the control reference design (CR design), where either is used as embedding reference and as differential analysis reference, and iii) a design where an atlas and a control dataset are used in different steps of the workflow (ACR design). In this analytical design, the atlas dataset is used as the embedding reference; subsequently, both the disease and the control datasets are mapped to the same latent space; finally, differential analysis is performed contrasting the disease dataset to the control dataset only.</p><p id="P10">In the following sections, we quantitatively assess the ability of these three designs (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>) to identify disease-specific cell states in simulations and real data.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Simulations show precise detection of out-of-reference cell states with combined use of atlas and control datasets</title><p id="P11">To compare reference designs in a scenario with ground-truth, we simulated the attributes of atlas, control and disease datasets by splitting scRNA-seq data from real studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>). We collected publicly available data from 13 studies that profiled healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), comprising profiles from 1248 donors, which we harmonised to obtain a consistent cell type annotation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). We select cells from one study (29 donors) and randomly split the donors to simulate the disease dataset (16 donors) and the control dataset (13 donors). Using different donors from the same study ensures that cohort demographics and experimental protocols are matched between disease and control datasets, while donor and library effects present in real data are maintained. The cells from the 12 remaining studies (1219 donors) form the atlas dataset. To simulate the presence of a cell population specific to the disease dataset - which we define as an <italic>out-of-reference</italic> (OOR) state, we select an annotated cell type and remove cells with that label in the control and atlas dataset. Overall, we tested the ability to identify 15 different cell types as the OOR state.</p><p id="P12">We apply the following workflow to identify the OOR state: we learn a latent space embedding on the reference of choice (atlas or control) using the scVI model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lopez <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, left). Then, we use transfer learning with scArches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lotfollahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) to map the query dataset(s) to the trained scVI model. This places cells from the disease and reference datasets in the same latent space, which captures common cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, centre). Of note, with the ACR design, the atlas dataset is used only to train the latent embedding model, but after mapping with scArches only disease and control datasets are used for differential analysis. This reduces the computational burden of handling a dataset of hundreds of thousands of cells. Finally, we use neighbourhood-level differential abundance (DA) testing with Milo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dann <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) to identify cell states enriched in cells from the disease dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, right), where neighbourhoods with SpatialFDR &lt; 10% and a log-Fold Change (logFC) in abundance &gt; 0 are defined as predicted OOR cell states.</p><p id="P13">Across simulations with different OOR states, we found that combining the use of the atlas and control dataset (ACR design) led to sensitive detection of neighbourhoods with a high fraction of OOR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 1</xref>). Conversely the AR design led to an inflated number of false positives, where significant enrichment was also detected when the fraction of unseen cells is low or 0. Using only the control dataset led to more balanced logFCs, but still a higher false positive rate compared to the ACR design. Only the ACR design maintained FDR control across simulations (i.e. it rarely identifies enriched neighbourhoods with a small fraction of unseen cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>). The ACR design also performs better when using just the logFC as a metric to prioritize neighbourhoods containing OOR cells, regardless of the p-value, by quantifying the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>, right). The overall variance in sensitivity across different simulations is mostly explained by the number of cells in the OOR state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 2</xref>). Notably, we found no significant difference in the quality of integration with different designs, in terms of conservation of cell types and batch removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Studies that use atlas datasets to identify disease-associated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lotfollahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sikkema et al. 2022</xref>) often omit differential testing and define OOR cells using two criteria. Firstly, OOR cells are expected to segregate from atlas cells in the latent space. In our simulations the OOR cell state is not consistently distinguished by clustering or by distance to reference cells in the latent space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 4</xref>). Secondly, different cell-level metrics for query-to-reference mapping quality are used to flag OOR cells, such as reconstruction error or uncertainty over a cell type classifier trained on the atlas. The assumption is that, if the disease-specific cell state was not seen during training of the dimensionality reduction model, mapping quality metrics should be low. In our hands, mapping quality metrics failed to distinguish ground-truth OOR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. figure 5A</xref>) or neighbourhoods with high fraction of OOR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. figure 5B</xref>). When using an ACR design, we could increase the sensitivity by prioritising neighbourhoods where the mapping quality was noticeably worse for the disease dataset cells compared to the control dataset cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 5C</xref>). However, overall we found that using mapping quality metrics to identify OOR populations performed significantly worse than using the logFC estimated from differential analysis.</p><p id="P15">We tested whether using the healthy atlas in the ACR design reduces the number of control donors needed for detection of disease-specific states. Specifically, we repeated the simulations contrasting cells in a pseudo-disease dataset of 7 donors with a control dataset of increasing numbers of donors (from 3 to 12). We found that across simulations with different OOR cell populations, the true positive rate and especially the false discovery rate varied with the number of control donors with the CR design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, OOR-detection outcomes were only marginally affected by the number of control donors when the ACR reference design was used, suggesting that the ACR design can minimise the number of independent control samples required. We also tested how OOR state detection is affected by the size of the atlas dataset used. We expect that if certain normal cell states are undersampled in the atlas dataset, these states might be wrongly predicted to be out-of-reference. We measured the rate of false positives with AR and ACR design when including an increasing number of PBMC studies in the atlas dataset, from 1 to 12 studies, ordered by number of cells in the study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). While for both designs sensitivity was significantly decreased when using just 1 or 2 studies in the atlas dataset, we observed that the false positive rate increased with smaller atlas datasets with AR design. Conversely almost no false positives were called with ACR design, even with the smallest atlas dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In summary, combining the use of an atlas dataset and of a control dataset for identification of disease-specific cell states significantly reduced the rate of false discoveries compared to using only an atlas or only a control dataset, and led to robust detection of putative disease states, even with a varying number of samples in the control or the atlas dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Matched controls allow the most sensitive out-of-reference detection</title><p id="P17">Our results indicate that mapping matched pseudo-disease and control datasets to an atlas dataset enhances the sensitivity to detect OOR states. However in practice there are cases where collecting matched control samples is especially challenging (e.g. brain tumour studies, or studies of osteosarcoma). Therefore, we tested whether selecting a subset of samples from the atlas to use as control dataset in ACR design performed as well as using matched control samples. Specifically, we run the disease-state detection workflow with ACR design defining as control dataset either (a) donors from the same study (matched control), (b) a random subsample of donors from the atlas dataset (random control) or (c) a subset of donors selected by similarity in cell abundances to the disease dataset donors (close control) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 7A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). In all cases, the control donors are excluded from the atlas dataset used for scVI training. We found that using the matched control always outperformed subsampling from the atlas, and using the close control only marginally reduced the FDR compared to random subsampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 7B-C</xref>). While using any type of control always outperformed differential analysis on the full atlas dataset, these results highlight that comparison against a set of matched controls is always advantageous, likely minimizing false positives driven by hidden confounding factors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mapping to a reference cell atlas improves detection of IFN-stimulated states in COVID-19 patients</title><p id="P18">We next assessed the benefit of using a healthy atlas for identification of altered states in a real disease cohort. Specifically, we applied our workflow to detect immune cells responding to viral infection in blood from COVID-19 patients. We used a published dataset of single-cell transcriptomes from PBMCs from 90 patients with varying severities of COVID-19 and 23 healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stephenson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). As atlas dataset, we used harmonised scRNA-seq profiles from 12 studies that collected PBMCs from a total of 1219 healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). We applied our workflow to identify disease-associated states, using the healthy PBMC atlas for joint latent embedding (ACR design) or using only the COVID-19 and control datasets (CR design). Also in this case, the atlas dataset is used for scVI model training, but only model weights are used for mapping with scArches and all downstream analysis is performed solely on COVID-19 and control datasets.</p><p id="P19">To quantify the ability of different reference designs to identify disease-associated states, we tested whether amongst the COVID-19-enriched neighborhoods we could detect cells with activated interferon (IFN) signalling, which is a key pathway involved in antiviral response and a recognized hallmark of COVID-19. We define IFN-stimulated cells by expression of the gene signature defined by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We observed a stronger correlation between the DA logFC and the mean IFN response signature when using the ACR design compared to just using the control as reference (ACR pearson R = 0.63, CR pearson R = 0.51, Fisher’s z transformation p-value &lt; 2.2e–16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>). Stratifying by cell type, the correlation is especially strong in the myeloid compartment, where the strongest IFN-stimulation is observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 8A</xref>). Amongst the IFN-low states identified as enriched in COVID-19 with the ACR design, we found primarily plasmablasts and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 8B</xref>), which are expected to expand in response to COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sette and Crotty, 2021</xref>). The CR design additionally detected a strong enrichment in COVID-19 cells in neighbourhoods of IFN-low naive B and T cells, which is in contrast with the widely reported lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen and John Wherry, 2020</xref>), and this enrichment is not explained by expression of proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 8C</xref>). We also compared reference designs on the ability to distinguish disease-specific phenotypes by clusters and similarity in the latent space: both designs performed equally well in the separation of fine-grained cell types annotated by the original authors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 9A</xref>). However, looking into cell annotations where classification performance was different between the two designs, we found that using the ACR design led to more accurate distinction of cell states with known disease-specific phenotypes, including proliferating CD8+T cells, which over-express exhaustion markers, early CD38+ HSCs, exhausted B cells and, notably, a small subset of malignant B cells originating from a COVID-19 patient diagnosed with leukaemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 9B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stephenson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Of note, the number of cells in the control dataset (used for scVI model training with the CR design) is about 3 times smaller than the number of cells in the query dataset. Since Lotfollahi et al. reported robust TL performance with equal sized reference and query datasets, we asked whether using TL might be a suboptimal choice for joint latent embedding with CR design on this dataset. To test this, we compared the disease-state detection workflow using TL with scArches to <italic>de novo</italic> integration, using scVI on the concatenated reference and query datasets. We found that regardless of the latent embedding model used, the integration leveraging the healthy reference atlas leads to more precise detection of IFN-stimulated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>). Notably, when using the ACR design, transfer learning performs as well as <italic>de novo</italic> integration. This shows that transfer learning is an effective integration strategy for disease-state identification, and supports the practice of model sharing to overcome the practical hurdles of human data sharing and to reduce the computational burden of atlas-based analysis.</p><p id="P22">With precise distinction of cell states enriched in COVID-19, we can examine the phenotypic heterogeneity within disease-associated states. In many case-control scRNA-seq studies, cell subtypes are distinguished by iterative rounds of dataset subsetting and subclustering, then differential expression and differential abundance analysis is used to characterise whether subtypes are associated with disease. In blood COVID-19 scRNA-seq studies this procedure frequently leads to a split between an IFN-stimulated COVID-19-associated subcluster and a IFN-low subtype enriched in healthy controls in several PBMC compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, IFN-activation is not global, and transitional or alternative pathological phenotypes might be present in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. In our neighbourhood-level analysis with ACR design, we observe a strong enrichment in cells that express high IFN signature. However, neighbourhoods with relatively low IFN signature are significantly associated with disease, for example amongst classical (CD14+) monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3E</xref>), which are notably expanded in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Based on the assignment of cells to neighbourhoods, we separate 3 phenotypes of CD14+ monocytes: normal classical monocytes, COVID-associated IFN-low monocytes and COVID-associated IFN-high monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3F</xref>). We observed that the proportion of CD14+ monocytes of different phenotypes changed significantly in patients with different disease severity: the IFN-high state was most prominent in mild and asymptomatic cases, while the IFN-low state became predominant in patients with moderate, severe and critical disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3G</xref>). This observation is in line with the notion that interferon stimulation acts as a protective pathway in the acute phase of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hadjadj <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In contrast, when defining IFN-high and IFN-low states after differential analysis with CR design, we found the distinction between severity status to be significantly less pronounced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 10A-C</xref>). In particular, we find a high fraction of IFN-low COVID-enriched monocytes also in healthy and asymptomatic individuals, indicating that this design wasn’t able to distinguish IFN-low normal monocyte cells from the IFN-low phenotype in severe COVID-19. To characterise the distinct COVID-19 specific phenotypes, we performed differential expression analysis between IFN-high and IFN-low COVID-associated monocytes. Together with IFN-associated genes, IFN-high monocytes showed higher expression of HLA genes, leukocyte-recruiting chemokines (CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11) and markers of activation (FCGR3A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. table 2</xref>). In contrast, the IFN-low cells enriched in severe disease over-express S100 genes, previously identified as key markers of COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Singh and Ali, 2022</xref>). This HLA-DRlo S100hi phenotype corresponds to a subset of dysfunctional monocytes associated with severe COVID-19, previously described in an independent cohort through direct comparison of mild and severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schulte-Schrepping <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In summary, using atlas and control reference on a COVID-19 cohort led to precise detection of blood cell states associated with response to infection, without requiring subclustering analysis, while still distinguishing phenotypically distinct pathological cell states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">In this study we quantitatively examine the impact of the choice of reference dataset on the task of identification of altered cell states from scRNA-seq data of diseased tissues.

K. Perez <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In parallel, the single-cell community is moving towards the generation of large, harmonised collections of data from the same tissue, with the explicit aim to serve as maps for contextualization of altered cellular conditions, and several studies use these datasets as references for discovery of disease-states, also in the absence of controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jardine <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Szabo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Reichart <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sikkema <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The option to use large curated datasets is amenable to efficient data re-use and especially for tissues where collection of matched healthy controls is challenging, such as studies of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Olah <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Leng <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In this work we demonstrate on simulations and real disease datasets that atlas datasets are not a substitute for control samples, but they should be used to increase the sensitivity and precision of disease-state discovery.</p><p id="P25">We present a quantitative benchmark for the task of detection of out-of-reference cell states. We used these <italic>in silico</italic> experiments to compare reference selection choices, but also to highlight shortcomings of mapping quality-control metrics that have been used as heuristics to prioritise disease-specific cell states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 5</xref>). We designed evaluation experiments and chose methods for integration and differential analysis with the specific use-case of disease datasets in mind. We believe our results will extrapolate beyond to other types of case-control studies, as long as certain assumptions apply: we assume that all the cell states observed in the control dataset are also found in the atlas dataset and that only a fraction of cell types are altered in the disease datasets. We believe these are reasonable assumptions when comparing healthy and pathological states in the same human tissue. However, cellular phenotypes might be different with alternative case-control designs, for example when measuring the effect of genetic perturbations in cell lines, where we expect less diversity of cellular phenotypes in the wild-type control and all perturbed cells might be affected to an extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Replogle <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P26">With the disease analysis scenario in mind, we use a transfer learning (TL) method for joint dimensionality reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lotfollahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), as an efficient alternative to integration of the concatenated disease and reference datasets. We made this choice envisioning that in the future the single-cell community would be sharing trained models for fast re-use or integrated atlases, which do not require downloading and reprocessing data from millions of cells. We expect our reference design analysis results to be robust to the use of <italic>de novo</italic> integration, as shown on the COVID-19 application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>), or to other TL-based methods for query-to-reference mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To date, these and other integration methods have been primarily benchmarked on the tasks of batch correction, automatic cell type annotation and fast analysis of new data generated from the same biological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tran <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chazarra-Gil <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Luecken <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While the systematic comparison of different integration methods on disease datasets is beyond the scope of this study, the benchmarking set-up and python package presented in this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MarioniLab/oor_benchmark">https://github.com/MarioniLab/oor_benchmark</ext-link>) could serve as groundwork for future comparisons focused on alternative integration methods.</p><p id="P27">The results from our analyses have important implications for experimental design of single-cell genomics studies of diseased tissues. We show that, when an atlas dataset is available, it is possible to reduce the number of control samples without introducing false discoveries and minimal impact on sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>). In addition, our analyses indicate that matched controls are always to be preferred over selecting a subset of samples from published data to use as control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 7</xref>). To an extent, accounting for confounding covariates in differential analysis based on available metadata might reduce the false discovery rate when no matched controls are available. However, it is to be expected that comparing uniformly processed healthy and disease samples from a similar population will minimise variability associated with known and hidden confounders. Selecting samples from published data based on phenotypic similarity led to a small improvement in performance compared to selection of samples at random. While here we applied a naive approach to define sample similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 7A</xref>), novel methods to model sample-level heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data are being explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boyeau <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mitchel <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These could improve the matching of disease samples to optimal controls, and provide new insights into which technical and demographic variables are likely to affect disease-to-healthy comparisons.</p><p id="P28">Having demonstrated the advantages of atlas-based analysis of disease and control cohorts, this work emphasises the importance of meta-analysis to build population-scale cell atlases of human tissues. For certain tissues the wealth of available data has reached the scale of cell atlases, such as for blood, lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sikkema <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Litviñuková <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hocker <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Koenig <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) or gastro-intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Elmentaite <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, efforts for integration and harmonisation are still in progress and we expect these integrated datasets to be frequently updated, to incorporate data from more individuals. While this process is underway, false positives might arise in atlas-based analysis of disease datasets if normal cell states are missed in the atlas dataset because of insufficient sampling. We show that joint mapping of disease and control samples can help to maintain a low rate of false positives with smaller atlas datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 6</xref>), making disease analysis more robust to atlas updates. We hope this encourages early sharing of beta versions of integrated tissue atlases (as exemplified by the Azimuth developers <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/">https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/</ext-link>), as these could already provide a valuable resource for the study of human pathologies.</p><p id="P29">Our analysis on a COVID-19 cohort highlights how using a cell atlas to contextualise data from a case-control study leads to more sensitive detection of cell states associated with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). While the simulated OOR cases exemplify a case where a single cluster of transcriptionally distinct cells are disease-specific, the activation of the interferon signalling in response to infection represents an example of a common response across cell types, which is rarely captured as a principal source of variation, when performing a cluster-centric analysis. With precise distinction of cell states enriched in COVID19, we can examine the phenotypic heterogeneity within disease-associated states. In many case-control scRNA-seq studies, cells with the same annotation from the disease and healthy condition are contrasted with DE analysis, but this procedure might dilute the disease-specific signature if diseased tissue contains cells with both the normal phenotype and the pathological phenotype, or several distinct pathological subtypes. Alternatively, distinct cell subtypes are distinguished by iterative rounds of dataset subsetting and subclustering, then differential abundance analysis is used to characterise whether subtypes are associated with disease. In blood COVID-19 scRNA-seq studies, this procedure leads to a binary distinction between an IFN-high COVID-19-associated subcluster and an IFN-low subtype enriched in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). With subpopulation-level differential abundance analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dann <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) we capture heterogeneous COVID-19 enriched states in several cell types, including CD14+ monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3E-G</xref>). While the original study reported relative increase in IFN-activated CD14+ monocyte abundance with COVID-19, we identify distinct IFN-high and IFN-low pathological subtypes, associated with distinct disease severities. These subtypes correspond to subsets of dysfunctional monocytes previously described in an independent cohort, through explicit comparison of mild and severe cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">suppl. figure 10D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schulte-Schrepping <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). This example demonstrates that precise disease-state detection with ACR design enables the study of transitional and heterogeneous pathological cell states.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combined use of a cell atlas and matched controls as references enables the most precise identification of affected cell states in disease scRNA-seq datasets. We envision our analysis will instruct the design of new cohort studies, guide efficient data re-use and provide guiding principles for analysis of disease dataset and construction of cell atlases.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>PBMC data preprocessing</title><p id="P31">We collected raw gene expression counts and cell type annotations from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) 10X Genomics scRNA-seq data from 13 publications, available via the cellxgene portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections">https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.

We assigned cells to neighborhoods (milopy.core.make_nhoods, parameters: prop = 0.1) and counted the number of cells belonging to each sample in each neighborhood (milopy.core.count_cells). We assigned to each neighborhood a cell type label based on majority voting of the cells belonging to that neighborhood. To test for enrichment of cells from the disease dataset, we model the cell count in neighborhoods as a negative binomial generalised linear model, using a log-linear model to model the effects of disease status on cell counts (log-Fold Change, logFC). Although the split between control and disease samples was balanced in terms of available metadata, in the query study there is a known batch effect between the three sites from which samples were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stephenson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Therefore we included the site identity as a confounding covariate in the differential abundance model when using the ACR and CR design, although we found the results presented here were robust even without modelling this confounder (data not shown).

We tested simulations alternatively using 15 annotated cell states as OOR cell state. <bold>(B)</bold> Example outcome of query-to-reference mapping and differential analysis with different reference designs: (left) UMAP embedding of scVI latent space learnt on embedding reference dataset, points are colored by cell type clusters (as in A) and the icons in the top left corner indicate the type of embedding reference dataset used; (center) UMAP embedding of cells from differential analysis reference and disease datasets on scVI latent space learnt from embedding reference dataset, colored by type of dataset and to highlight (in pink) the OOR cell state; (right) Milo neighbourhood graph visualisation of differential abundance testing results: each point represents a neighbourhood, points are colored by the log-Fold Change (logFC) in cell abundance between disease and reference cells. Only neighbourhoods where significant enrichment in disease cells (10% SpatialFDR and log-Fold Change &gt; 0) was detected are colored. Points are positioned based on the coordinates in UMAP embedding of the neighbourhood index cell, the size of points is proportional to the number of cells in the neighbourhood. <bold>(C)</bold> Scatterplot of differential abundance log-Fold Change against fraction of perturbation-specific cells for each neighbourhood for the simulation shown in C.

To compare performance considering the logFC and confidence (10% SpatialFDR), we measured the false discovery rate (FDR), false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR). To compare performance using logFC only as a metric for prioritization, we measure the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Points represent simulations with different OOR states. Tests on the same simulated data are connected. <bold>(E)</bold> Robustness to size of control cohort with ACR and CR designs: mean true positive rate (TPR) and false discovery rate (FDR) for simulations with increasing number of donors in the control dataset (x-axis), using atlas to control reference design (ACR, green) or control reference design (CR, orange). The error bar shows the standard deviation over five simulations using a different sample of donors. In these simulations 7 donors were used in the disease dataset.
