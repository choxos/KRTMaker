Senescent cancer cells strongly modify the intratumoural microenvironment favoring immunosuppression and, thereby, tumour growth. An emerging strategy to optimise current therapies is to combine them with treatments that eliminate senescent cells. To this end, we undertook an unbiased proteomics approach to identify surface markers contributing to senescent cells immune evasion. Through this approach, we discovered that the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L2, but not PD-L1, is upregulated across multiple senescent human and murine cells. Importantly, blockade of PD-L2 strongly synergises with genotoxic chemotherapy, causing remission of solid tumours in mice. We show that PD-L2 inhibition prevents the persistence of chemotherapy-induced senescent cells, which exert cell-extrinsic immunomodulatory actions. In particular, upon chemotherapy, tumours deficient in PD-L2 fail to produce cytokines of the CXCL family, do not recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and are eliminated in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. We conclude that blockade of PD-L2 improves chemotherapy efficacy by reducing the intratumoural burden of senescent cells and their associated recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These findings provide a novel strategy to exploit vulnerabilities arising in tumour cells as a result of therapy-induced damage and cellular senescence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) constitute an important immune checkpoint that controls the establishment of immune tolerance and negatively regulates the activity and proliferation of PD-1-expressing immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. They are also key contributors to immune evasion by cancer cells, which frequently overexpress PD-L1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Immunotherapies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have been successfully used in the clinic against a broad spectrum of tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. An alternative PD-1 ligand, PD-L2 (B7-DC) has received comparatively less attention due to the lower frequency of PD-L2 positive cancers, compared to PD-L1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">PD-L1 and PD-L2 share roughly a 40% of their amino acid sequence and they compete for PD-1 binding, although, interestingly, PD-L2 exhibits a 2- to 6-fold higher binding affinity to PD-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. PD-L2 is predominantly expressed by dendritic cells, macrophages, and other antigen presenting cells, together with other immune populations. Additionally, in the context of cancer, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) can express PD-L2 and contribute to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. PD-L2 expression is most frequent in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and abundant in small intestine and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, gallbladder cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. There is little understanding about the biological role of PD-L2 for immune evasion in cancers, although it is interesting to note that ectopic expression of PD-L2 produces immune evasion through inhibition of PD-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In the case of monocytes and macrophages, interferon γ (IFN-γ) upregulates both PD-L1 and PD-L2, while IL-4 selectively upregulates PD-L2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, at present, there is limited information regarding how levels of PD-L2 are regulated in cancer. Two recent reports have found upregulation of PD-L2 in some cancer cell lines in vitro in response to cisplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> or radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy is still the most common treatment for solid cancers. DNA damage and other insults associated with these therapies can trigger therapy-induced senescence (TIS) in cancer cells and in other intratumoural cells, such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The senescence program constitutes a cell-intrinsic barrier against oncogene-driven proliferation and transformation, however, it also involves a prominent secretory activity known as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The SASP is complex and heterogeneous, comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix remodeling enzymes and growth factors, that result in cell-extrinsic effects known to facilitate tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. More specifically, the SASP includes immunosuppressive factors, like TGF-β, and chemokines that recruit myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, while senescence is a cell-intrinsic barrier for cancer cells, it is also pro-tumourigenic through its extrinsic actions on the tumour microenviroment.</p><p id="P5">Therefore, therapies that selectively eliminate senescent cells (known as senolytic therapies) have been demonstrated in multiple studies to synergise with cancer chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. This is the case of senolytic compounds, such as ABT-263 (navitoclax)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, derivatives of this drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, dasatinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, cardiac glycosides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and mTOR inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Also, elimination of senescent cells using engineered CAR-T cells leads to improved tumour control in combination with MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Whether PD-L2 plays a role in the senescent phenotype and whether this feature can be exploited in novel therapies is unknown. Here, we show the importance of PD-L2 upregulation in the persistence of therapy-induced senescent cells and, thereby, in their ability to modulate tumour immunosurveillance across a variety of mouse models of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Senescent cancer cells overexpress PD-L2</title><p id="P6">To gain insight into the immunomodulatory potential of senescent cells, we performed an unbiased proteomic screen of proteins enriched in the plasma membrane of senescent and non-senescent human SK-MEL-103 melanoma cells, using doxorubicin or the CDK-4/6 inhibitor palbociclib to trigger therapy-induced senescence (TIS). Interestingly, among the upregulated plasma membrane proteins in both TIS conditions (doxorubicin and palbociclib) was PD-L2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Moreover, drug class enrichment analysis of datasets from the LINCS L1000 project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> revealed that PD-L2 is upregulated by common inducers of cellular senescence, such as DNA-damage and cell cycle inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Indeed, PD-L2 transcript levels were significantly upregulated in TIS in human and murine cancer cell lines of various origins, including melanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b-d</xref>). In contrast, increases in PD-L1 transcript levels were modest or absent. PD-L2 expression was also elevated in vivo following the induction of TIS in human xenografts and mouse syngeneic tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Based on the above findings, we next assessed cell surface levels of PD-L2 in TIS. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry-based analysis revealed elevated PD-L2 in SK-MEL-103 cells, both in vitro and in xenograft models, upon TIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>), which was not present in a PD-L2-KO SK-MEL-103 clonal cell line generated by CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). Upregulation of PD-L2 was detected by flow cytometry in cell lines of different cancer cell types that underwent TIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>) and occurred gradually during the development of TIS over a period of 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). It is interesting to note that osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, which are unable to undergo senescence (due to the absence of RB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>), did not upregulate PD-L2 in response to palbociclib, in contrast to TIS-competent osteosarcoma U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the upregulation of PD-L2 is a common feature of the program elicited by therapy-induced senescence (TIS) and results in elevated plasma membrane PD-L2 levels.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PD-L2-KO tumours are highly susceptible to chemotherapy</title><p id="P8">The consistent upregulation of PD-L2 in therapy-induced senescent cells prompted us to study its relevance in the context of cancer therapy. For this, we generated a murine PD-L2-KO Panc02 cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) and we injected WT and PD-L2-KO cells orthotopically into the pancreas of immunocompetent mice that were subsequently treated with genotoxic chemotherapy (doxorubicin). Interestingly, chemotherapy controlled the growth of PD- L2-KO tumours significantly better than their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As a result, mice bearing PD-L2-KO tumours and treated with doxorubicin lived significantly longer than mice with treated WT tumours or untreated PD-L2-KO tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To extend our observations to a different tumour model, we injected WT and PD-L2-KO B16-OVA melanoma cells orthotopically into C57BL/6 mice. Again, we observed a profound reduction in tumour growth rate in PD-L2-KO tumours treated with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, WT tumours had a partial and transient reduction in tumour growth in response to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the expression of PD-L2 by cancer cells limits the efficacy of chemotherapy.</p><p id="P9">We next analysed whether a functional adaptive immune response was required for the control of PD-L2-KO tumours. For this, we injected WT and PD-L2-KO Panc02 cells into the pancreas of athymic nude mice (lacking T cells) and quantified tumour growth over time. Neither in the absence of chemotherapy nor after administration of doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>) did tumours show any significant difference in growth rate across experimental groups, suggesting that the adaptive immune system was responsible for the phenotype associated to PD-L2-KO tumours. To elucidate which major T cell subset was essential for tumour regression, we depleted CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from animals bearing PD-L2-KO pancreatic tumours and were subsequently treated with doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Mice lacking CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were unable to control PD-L2-KO tumours after chemotherapy, while control animals or mice treated with anti-CD4 blocking antibodies presented a robust suppression of tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are responsible for the efficient removal of PD-L2-KO tumours upon chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Absence of PD-L2 expression prevents the recruitment of myeloid cells after chemotherapy</title><p id="P10">To better understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced efficiency of chemotherapy in PD-L2-KO tumours, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the immune infiltrate in Panc02 PD-L2 WT and KO tumours. We quantified a panel of sixteen markers of different immune populations by mass cytometry 5 days after the start of doxorubicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We detected a substantial recruitment of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in PD-L2-WT tumours after treatment with doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This was in sharp contrast to PD-L2-KO tumours, which were unable to recruit these myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). No significant variations were observed across experimental conditions for other immune populations, including T cells, macrophages, or NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed that depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells resulted in accumulation of Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells in chemotherapy-treated PD-L2-KO tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). To evaluate the impact of Gr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in this tumour model, we depleted Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells from animals bearing WT tumours and treated with doxorubicin, observing an improvement in tumour control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These results indicate that, upon chemotherapy, immunosuppressive myeloid cells are recruited in a PD-L2-dependent manner. Conversely, absence of PD-L2 prevents recruitment of Gr1<sup>+</sup> immunosuppressive myeloid cells post-chemotherapy, rendering tumours susceptible to the action of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PD-L2 determines the persistence of tumour senescent cells post-chemotherapy</title><p id="P11">We wondered about the degree of similarity between senescent cancer cells lacking or expressing PD-L2. To evaluate this, we analysed by RNAseq the transcriptome of both cell lines upon doxorubicin. Remarkably, their expression profiles were essentially identical with only 10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) out of ~21,000 detected genes (|FC| &gt; 1.5, FDR &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The enrichment of signatures of p53 activation and inflammation were evident and similar in WT and KO doxorubicin-treated Panc02 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that PD-L2 is not relevant for the induction of senescence in vitro.</p><p id="P12">Given the high similarity between the transcriptomes of PD-L2 WT and KO cells, we wondered whether PD-L2 is important for the intratumoural persistence of senescent after chemotherapy. To evaluate senescent cell burden in orthotopic pancreatic tumours, we quantified senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SABG) and p21<sup>+</sup> cells by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, 5 days post-chemotherapy, SABG<sup>+</sup> and p21<sup>+</sup> cells were clearly increased in PD-L2-WT tumours, but not in PD-L2 KO tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We interpret that, in accordance with our previous results, the absence of PD-L2 impairs the persistence of intratumoural senescent cells post-therapy.</p><p id="P13">It is known that senescent cells contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment by recruiting MDSC into the tumour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. A number of cytokines and chemokines present in the SASP mediate this recruitment, including IL-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, CCL2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, CXCL1 and CXCL2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We quantified the levels of intratumoural chemokines and cytokines in our Panc02 model and observed that cytokines associated with MDSCs recruitment were lowest in PD-L2-KO tumours post-chemotherapy, particularly in the case CXCL1 and CXCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Our results suggest that lower levels of cellular senescence and decreased myeloid cell recruitment by secreted factors contribute to the synergic effect of chemotherapy and PD-L2 deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Combinational therapy with blocking anti-PD-L2 antibodies</title><p id="P14">Given our previous results, we explored the role PD-L2 activity in additional models. MMTV-PyMT mice develop spontaneous mammary gland tumours, reaching the status of adenoma and carcinoma stages at 9 and 13 weeks of age, respectively. At 9 weeks of age, mice were weekly treated with doxorubicin for 4 weeks and tumours were analysed. In agreement with our previous models, we observed abundant senescent cells (SABG<sup>+</sup>) in post-therapy tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Notably, SABG<sup>+</sup> cells were also PD-L2<sup>+</sup> by immunohistochemistry, further confirming that PD-L2 is a marker of therapy-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). To determine the role of PD-L2 in this setting, we used a commercially available blocking anti-PD-L2 antibody (TY-25). Treatment with TY-25 alone did not have a significant effect on tumour growth and doxorubicin had a modest effect in reducing tumour growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Remarkably, the combination of both treatments, TY-25 and doxorubicin, resulted in complete tumour regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To characterise the anti-tumour effect of combined chemotherapy and PD-L2 antibody, we analysed lymphocytic infiltration by immunohistochemistry and observed a highly significant increase of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>). To test the involvement of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the remission elicited by anti-PD-L2 treatment, we performed another experiment including anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 blocking antibodies. While blocking CD4<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect, blocking CD8<sup>+</sup> cells led to tumour regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). Together, these results indicate increased immune surveillance of senescent and non-senescent tumour cells upon PD-L2 suppression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Here, we demonstrate that senescence-inducing therapies employed in the clinic result in upregulation of PD-L2 in cancer cells. While the expression of PD-L2 is not necessary for senescence induction and maintenance, it contributes to immune evasion of post-therapy tumours. The presence of senescent cancer cells within tumours, even if they account to a subset of the tumor cells, is of high relevance due to their immunosuppressive secretome. In agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we show that PD-L2-proficient tumours secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, which recruit myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) upon therapy. Importantly, tumours deficient in PD-L2 fail to produce these chemokines and to recruit MDSCs, rendering tumours vulnerable to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We finally show that anti-PD-L2 antibodies unleash the immune clearance of tumours post-chemotherapy, including senescent as well as non-senescent cancer cells.</p><p id="P16">The accumulation of senescent cells with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and in multiple pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, including cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, has been partially attributed to defective immunosurveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 70 μm strainer, washed in PBS, incubated in RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 5 minutes at room temperature and then washed with PBS a second time. The cells were then resuspended incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 at 1:400 (BD Fc BlockTM, BD Biosciences #553142) for 10 minutes, at 4° C in 50 μl in Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (CSB). Then, an equal volume of the 16-antibody cocktail from the Maxpar mouse spleen/lymph node phenotyping panel kit (Fluidgm #201306), spanning all major immune cell populations, was added and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, vortexed and incubated for 15 additional minutes. The cell suspension was then washed twice with 2 ml Maxpar CSB and fixed in 1.6% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 1 ml of 125 nM Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm) in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm), followed by vortex and incubation 4° C overnight. Acquisition was performed the following day after washing with Cell Acquisition Solution (Fluidigm) and mixing with diluted EQ bead solution (Fluidigm), following the manufacturer’s instructions, in a Helios detector (Fluidigm). The gating strategy is fully standardized and described in detail by the manufacturer. Briefly, Intercalator-Ir positive cells are selected, from which CD19<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes are defined. Next, TCRβ<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells are selected and, within this population, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are detected. From the TCRβ<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup> population, sequentially, we identified by sequential exclusion NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NK cells and CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells. Finally, among CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, macrophages and MDSCs were identified depending on Gr1 positivity.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Measurement of intratumoural cytokine and chemokine levels</title><p id="P43">Panc02 pancreatic tumours were flash frozen after excision and approximately 10 mg of tumour mass was homogeneised in RIPA lysis buffer (Merck) using a FastPrep-24 5G homogeneiser (MP Biomedicals) in the presence of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay (DC protein assay kit, BioRad). All samples were diluted to a protein concentration of 1.2 mg/ml in a total volume of 75 μl of RIPA and shipped to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) on dry ice. The intratumoural levels of CCL11 (eotaxin), G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, CXCL10 (IP 10), CXCL1 (KC), LIF, CXCL6 (LIX), CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCL9 (MIG), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CXCL2 (MIP-2), CCL5 (RANTES), TNFα and VEGF were determined using a Multiplexing LASER Bead Assay (Mouse Cytokine Array / Chemokine Array 31-Plex, Eve Technologies). For the cytokines and chemokines included in the assay but not shown in the manuscript (IL-13, IL-12p40, CCL4), no changes were observed.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>MMTV-PyMT model</title><p id="P44">Male PyMT mice were mated with FVB-WT female to generate female littermates that are PyMT/wild-type (WT). Mice were genotyped for the PyMT allele by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: forward primer, 5’-CGCACATACTGCTGGAAGAA and reverse primer, 5’-TGCCGGGAACGTTTTATTAG. Weights were recorded for every experiment. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen–free environment. At 9 weeks of age, PyMT mice were palpated to detect the onset of mammary tumour development. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg/kg doxorubicin or an equivalent volume of PBS, once a week for 4 weeks. Additional groups of mice were treated with anti-mouse PD-L2 (clone TY25, BioXCell, #BE0112), alone or in combination with doxorubicin. From the detection of palpable tumours, the mice were monitored for tumour growth with a caliper twice a week. Total tumour volume was determined using the formula: volume = (length * width<sup>2</sup>) / 2. The mice were euthanised 4 weeks after the onset of tumours and the start of the treatments. For depletion of specific immune populations, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with anti-CD4 (clone YTS 191, BioXCell #BE0119), anti-CD8α (clone 53-6.7, BioXCell #BE0004-1), or rat IgG (IgG2a isotype, BioXCell #BE0089) and euthanized at week 13. All the antibody treatments were administered i. p., every three days for four weeks, at a 10 mg/kg dose.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Immunohistochemistry and SABG in mammary tumours</title><p id="P45">For PMyT mice, mammary glands were either formalin-fixed or whole mounted, as previous described, and paraffin-embedded. IHC experiments were performed using the Dako EnVision+ System-HRP kit. Using the Leica microtome system, 3 μm-thick sections were obtained, and antigen retrieval was performed using Tris EDTA buffer (pH 9) by boiling followed by washing in running water and blocking for endogenous peroxidase for 15 min at room temperature. The slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and, after 1 h of incubation with 3% BSA blocking solution, each of them was incubated with primary antibody against PD-L2 (1:100, CST #49189), CD3 (1:100, Abcam #ab16669), CD4 (1:1000, Abcam #ab183685) or CD8 (Abcam #1:2000, ab217344) at 4° C overnight. Followed by washing, they were incubated with System-HRP Labelled Polymer Anti-Rabbit (Dako, K400311-2) secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin after the substrate (DAB) reaction step. For SABG staining, mammary gland samples were whole mounted using a fixative solution of 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Overnight staining with senescence β- galactosidase staining kit (CST) was performed directly in the fixed samples, previous to their inclusion in paraffin. Using the Leica microtome system, 3 μm-thick sections were obtained and counterstained with Liquid-Stable Nuclear Fast Red (VWR Life Science AMRESCO).</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P46">Results are presented as mean ± SEM for all data. All statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 and a p value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. Tests were applied as described in the figures, with the general use of two-tailed Student’s t-tests for pairwise comparisons between two isolated conditions and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison for experiments with three or more experimental conditions. For datasets including two independent factors, in which one of them is usually time, 2-way ANOVA was used. Specific tests for select experiments are detailed in the figure legends and/or in the methodological description.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S35"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Fig. 1</label><caption><title>PD-L2 is upregulated in human and murine senescent cancer cells.</title><p id="P47">(a) Drug class enrichment analysis for human <italic>PDCD1LG2</italic> (PD-L2).</p><p id="P48">(b) PD-L1/2 mRNA expression in human cancer cell lines treated with palbociclib.</p><p id="P49">(c) PD-L1/2 mRNA expression in human cancer cell lines after treatment with doxorubicin or palbociclib.</p><p id="P50">(d) PD-L1/2 mRNA expression in murine cancer cell lines treated with doxorubicin.</p><p id="P51">(e) Growth chart of SK-MEL-103 xenograft tumours in nude mice, untreated or treated with palbociclib, and SABG staining in toto of representative tumours.</p><p id="P52">(f) Representative example (1 out of n =3) of histogram for PD-L2 protein levels upon generation of a PD-L2-KO SK-MEL-103 cell line, in control and senescent conditions, measured by flow cytometry.</p><p id="P53">(g) CRISPR-Cas9 edition of the human <italic>PDCD1LG2</italic> locus, specifying the sgRNA biding site in exon 3.
