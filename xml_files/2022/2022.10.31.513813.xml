Here, we describe a new, simple, and high-throughput platform for multi-colour epigenetic analysis. The novelty of our approach is the ability to multiplex methylation and de-methylation signals in the same assay. We utilize an engineered methyltransferase enzyme that recognizes and labels all unmodified CpG sites with a fluorescent cofactor. In combination with the already established labelling of the de-methylation mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine via enzymatic glycosylation, we obtained a robust platform for simultaneous epigenetic analysis of these marks. We assessed the global epigenetic levels in multiple samples of colorectal cancer and observed a reduction in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels, but no change in DNA methylation levels between sick and healthy individuals. We also measured epigenetic modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and observed a decrease in both modification levels. Our results indicate that this assay may be used for the epigenetic characterization of clinical samples for research and patient management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>5-hydroxymethylcytosine</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>DNA methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>epigenetic biomarker</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">5-methylcytosine (5mC) is created by the addition of a methyl group to carbon at the 5 position of cytosine by methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs or MTases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These enzymes are responsible for the generation and maintenance of genomic methylation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, which play a crucial role in various cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mostly on cytosine of CG sequence motifs, commonly referred to as CpGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The methyl group is donated from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet), a universal cofactor involved in methyl group transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is a stable and heritable DNA modification, but it can be reversed in an active DNA demethylation process, where in the first step, 5mC is oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Since its rediscovery in 2009, 5hmC has become the focus of many studies, and it has been found that 5hmC is involved in physiological processes and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While global 5hmC levels decrease in most cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, 5mC has been shown to increase or decrease depending on the cancer type. Importantly, the commonly used bisulfite treatment for analysis of DNA methylation does not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC and thus reports a convolution of both levels. Global epigenetic analysis of both 5mC and 5hmC can serve in several key areas, such as early cancer detection, monitoring of disease progression, and response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Various approaches have been developed and are widely used for global detection and quantitation of 5mC and 5hmC. The most sensitive method for profiling cytosine DNA methylation is LC-MS/MS. Although this method is accurate and requires relatively small amounts (50-100 ng) of DNA to analyze, it requires expertise, expensive equipment, and demanding assay optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Simultaneous monitoring of global 5mC and 5hmC is possible with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring (LC–ESI–MS/MS–MRM). This method is fast, robust, and accurate; however, it requires expertise and cannot monitor multiple samples at once<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Other available methods are DNA dot-blot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, immunohistochemically (IHC) staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Although these assays are relatively fast and straightforward, they tend to produce high error rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and lack the sensitivity required to track minute but significant epigenetic content changes crucial for identifying related medical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these assays are not compatible with simultaneous detection of both 5mC and 5hmC due to the bulkiness of the used antibodies and contrast agents. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new technique that utilizes custom-made multi-sample array slides that enable sensitive quantification of a large number of samples quickly and accurately, opening an avenue for large-scale DNA epigenetic modification monitoring for research and clinical use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Unlike 5hmC which is amenable to direct optical detection in genomic DNA samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, direct labelling of cytosine methylation is extremely challenging due to the inert nature of the methyl group. An alternative is to label unmodified cytosines by enzymatic alkylation. The quantity of unmodified CpGs (um-CpGs) is inversely correlated to genomic methylation levels. DNA MTase enzymes may utilize synthetic cofactor analogs as alkylation agents in order to transfer functional groups to DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. CpG methyltransferases are blocked when the cytosine is methylated, and thus will label only um-CpGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We and others have shown that a double mutant of the CpG-specific DNA MTase M.Sssl can label unmodified cytosines with azide groups <italic>via</italic> the AdoYnAzide cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, M.Sssl is difficult to express at high concentrations and it tends to aggregate upon expression. Here, we introduce a corresponding double mutant of the homologous CpG-specific DNA MTase M.MpeI from the bacterium <italic>Mycoplasma penetrans</italic> for rapid and efficient labelling of um-CpGs.</p><p id="P5">The double mutant (dm) M.MpeI is easy to produce at high concentrations and may serve as a robust alkylation agent for methylation detection with AdoMet analogues. The enzyme transfers azide groups to unmodified cytosines in CpG sites, and then a fluorophore is clicked on by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) for optical detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). DNA samples are deposited on multi-sample array slides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and fluorescence intensity is read-out as an inverse measure of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Here, we develop and validate the M.MpeI (dm) assay for 5mC analysis and then combine it with direct 5hmC labelling using two different colours for simultaneous detection of both epigenetic marks. We also successfully apply the combined assay to colon cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) samples.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P6">M.MpeI (dm) is CpG specific and efficiently transfers azides to DNA.

Therefore, the active site was enlarged by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids Q136 and N374 to A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), leading to an M.MpeI double mutant (dm). To assess the activity of the mutant it was challenged with several AdoMet analogues with extended methyl group replacements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and screened using a modification/restriction assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows that M.MpeI WT is only active with the natural cofactor AdoMet while M.MpeI Q136A/N374A (M.MpeI dm) shows also activity with AdoYnYn (lower, lane 7) and AdoYnAzide (lower, lane 9).</p><p id="P7">In order to verify that M.MpeI (dm) labels CpG dinucleotides specifically, we performed reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) of nucleosides obtained after enzymatic fragmentation of DNA treated with M.MpeI (dm) and AdoYnAzide.

Moreover, the LOD value is even lower than that measured for the blood cancer patients, highlighting the assay’s sensitivity and ability to reliably measure and distinguish between healthy and sick individuals even at these low 5hmC levels.

The final calculated value is the absolute 5hmC level in each sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material
