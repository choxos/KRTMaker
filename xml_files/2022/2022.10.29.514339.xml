The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain center implicated in these processes, but how distinct NAc cell populations encode ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ to shape overconsumption remains unclear. Here, we probed the roles of NAc D1 and D2 cells in these processes using cell-specific recording and control in diverse behavioral paradigms that disentangle reward traits of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ related to food choice and overeating. NAc D2 cells encoded experience-dependent development of ‘liking’, while NAc D1 cells encoded innate ‘liking’ during the first food taste. Optogenetic control confirmed causal links of D1 and D2 cells to these aspects of ‘liking’. In relation to ‘wanting’, D1 and D2 cells encoded and promoted distinct aspects of food approach: D1 cells interpreted food cues while D2 cells also sustained food-visit-length that facilitates consumption. Finally, at the level of food choice, D1, but not D2, cell activity was sufficient to switch food preference, programming subsequent long-lasting overconsumption. By revealing complementary roles of D1 and D2 cells in consumption, these findings assign neural bases to ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ in a unifying framework of D1 and D2 cell activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>D1</kwd><kwd>D2</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>fiber photometry</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>food preference</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Overweight and obesity, and eating disorders generally, have increased in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial to better understand the factors that contribute to the development of different eating disorders. In the modern obesogenic environment, palatability and availability of foods play a major role in the development of overeating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Food consumption is not only motivated by the homeostatic need to monitor, restore and maintain energy balance. Homeostatic signals can also be overridden, causing us to engage in non-homeostatic eating that is driven by the sensory and/or hedonic properties of palatable foods with high fat and/or sugar contents. This ‘hedonic’ eating activates brain regions involved in reward, resulting in increased motivation to consume food, and increased energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] despite a state of satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P3">The ‘incentive salience theory’ of reward has provided a valuable framework for more than a decade for investigating the role of food hedonics in the context of appetitive behavior in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. This theory postulates that reward is not a unitary process, but comprises an affective pleasure component referred to as ‘liking’ and a non-affective motivational component referred to as ‘wanting’. ‘Liking’ is the hedonic component that reflects the immediate experience of eating a pleasurable food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. ‘Wanting’ is the incentive motivation (reward-seeking) that can lead to increased appetite, food cravings and also to overconsumption of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Looking at these psychological traits in eating behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], overeating in some individuals might reflect the abnormal functioning of either the ‘wanting’ or ‘liking’ mechanisms, and there are indications from subjects with eating disorders that ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ of obesogenic foods can also be dissociated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a key role in behaviors related to natural rewards and drugs of abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In the NAc, two important cell classes are medium spiny neurons expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1 cells) and those expressing D2 dopamine receptors (D2 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The precise contribution of D1 and D2 cells to reward-associated behaviors is still unresolved, and establishing a causal relationship between activation of each neuronal subtype and its effect on motivated behaviors has proven challenging. D1 cell activation is canonically considered to be related to positive rewarding events leading to persistent reinforcement, while activation of D2 cells is thought to facilitate aversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. However, the current literature is controversial regarding the functionality of these cells and their role in motivation-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Therefore, increased understanding of which cells in the dopaminergic system underly brain substrates of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ may open an avenue to comprehending the impact of food rewards on eating behaviors linked to obesity and other eating disorders. It may also provide insight into brain circuits and mechanisms underlying both hedonic and motivational components of reward, including mechanisms common to both natural and artificial rewards.</p><p id="P6">This paper aims to further understand the differential contribution of NAc D1 and D2 cells to different components of palatable food consumption, namely ‘liking’ (hedonic/perceiving food as pleasurable) and ‘wanting’ (incentive motivational value/desire/craving). We assess ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ from several different angles using multiple behavioral paradigms, while employing neuronal recording or optogenetic tools and analytical techniques, enabling us to better understand the forces underlying eating behavior that may lead to overconsumption.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NAc D1 cell activity is transiently increased, while D2 cell activity is transiently increased then suppressed, during periods of free consumption of a palatable food reward</title><p id="P7">To probe the neural mechanisms underpinning reward consumption, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> fiber photometry to record fluorescence of cre-dependent GCaMP6s calcium indicator selectively expressed in D1 cells (in D1 receptor-cre mice) or D2 cells (in adenosine A2a receptor gene (Adora2a)-cre mice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To determine how D1 and D2 cells represented solutions with different palatability, mice were first given free access to water from a bottle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a,b</xref>). Once they reliably consumed this, they were allowed to freely consume a highly palatable food (milkshake, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref>) over the course of five daily sessions, in the absence of nutrient deficit.</p><p id="P9">We found that before licking, both D1 and D2 cells transiently increased their activity, which peaked just after licking onset. In both D1 and D2 cells, the peak was more pronounced in response to milkshake than water, possibly reflecting hedonic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-d</xref>). However, after consumption onset, the activity patterns of the two populations differed; D1 cells returned to baseline, while D2 cell activity was suppressed below the baseline as the licking bout continued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Both cell types continued to respond to milkshake over subsequent sessions, but the D1 peak reduced over sessions, and the D2 suppression was exaggerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). These results demonstrate that D1 and D2 cells do not act as a single homogeneous population during consumption.</p><p id="P10">Milkshake consumption within a session (total number of licks) was significantly higher than water, and this was consistent across sessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c,d</xref>). This indicates more positive hedonic reactions to milkshake than water (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1d</xref>). However, the amount consumed provides an incomplete readout of ingestive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Therefore, to further probe the driving forces behind these changes in overall consumption, we investigated different aspects of free consumption of water vs. a palatable food (milkshake). In particular, we examined if it would be possible to differentiate between ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. We therefore analyzed licking microstructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], since it provides several measures to evaluate pleasure and motivation during liquid-food consumption in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Specifically, increases in the duration of single licks, licking bout duration and bout size (lick intensity determined by number of licks in a bout), and decreases in inter-lick interval (ILI), have been suggested to represent increased hedonic impact and palatability (‘liking’), while increases in bout number and decreases in inter-bout interval represent increased incentive salience (‘wanting’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We found that changes in ‘liking’ parameters paralleled greater ‘liking’ for milkshake over water; lick duration, bout duration and bout size increased significantly, while inter-lick interval (ILI) decreased significantly, between the water and first milkshake sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1e</xref>). Therefore, as expected, animals displayed more positive hedonic reactions (‘liking’) to the milkshake than to water. Lick duration also kept increasing over milkshake sessions, suggesting an increased hedonic component of milkshake consumption in later sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>, <bold>left</bold>).</p><p id="P12">Bout number increased, and inter-bout interval (IBI) decreased significantly between water and the first milkshake session, suggesting that mice were more motivated (‘wanted’) to consume milkshake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). IBI also kept decreasing across milkshake sessions, suggesting ‘wanting’ for milkshake increased over sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>, <bold>right</bold>).</p><p id="P13">We then performed multiple regression analysis to investigate whether <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium activity of NAc D1 and D2 cells during consumption of milkshake across all 5 sessions could predict the level of ‘liking’ or ‘wanting’ of the palatable food consumed. This analysis can identify key features of neural activation that predict specific aspects of palatable food consumption. In D1 cells, the minimum and maximum signal values were significant predictors of bout duration (‘liking’), explaining around 30% of the variability in bout duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a</xref>, <bold>top right</bold>), with negative and positive correlations to ‘liking’, respectively. The R<sup>2</sup> change values showed that the higher the initial increase (and to a smaller extent, the lower the subsequent decrease), the longer the bout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a</xref>). In D2 cells, we found that the area under the curve and the minimum signal during the 3 sec following lick onset were significant predictors of bout duration, together explaining around 40% of the variability in bout duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2b</xref>, <bold>top right</bold>). More specifically, the more the D2 cell signal decreases, the longer the bouts are and the higher the ‘liking’ is (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2b</xref>). Interestingly, in a similar analysis of inter-bout interval, IBI (‘wanting’ – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), the significant predictors in either D1 or D2 cell signals only explained a very small amount of IBI variability and were thus poor predictors overall.</p><p id="P14">Together, these findings show that <italic>ad libitum</italic> consumption of milkshake induces both ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ to eat. These two main components underlying palatable food consumption are more positively associated with consuming milkshake than water. However, we detected a dissociation between ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’, with the distinct signals in both D1 and D2 cells being more strongly correlated with ‘liking’ than ‘wanting’. Specifically, the initial activation in D1 cells at licking onset and the sustained inhibition of D2 cells activity during eating were good predictors of ‘liking’ parameters.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NAc D2 cells increase consumption by increasing ‘wanting’ despite a decrease in ‘liking’</title><p id="P15">We next employed optogenetics to investigate how the roles of NAc D1 and D2 cells differ during <italic>ad libitum</italic> palatable food consumption. Based on previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], we initially hypothesized that activation of NAc D1 cells would lead to increased consumption, whereas activation of NAc D2 cells – counteracting the natural suppression in activity described earlier – would decrease ‘liking’. However, it would not necessarily affect overall intake, depending on its effect on the ‘wanting’ aspect of consumption. To test our predictions, we injected the optogenetic cre-dependent excitatory actuator ChrimsonR or a control GFP virus, into the NAc of D1- or D2(A2a)-cre mice, and implanted optical fibers bilaterally in the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Consistent with our photometry data and our initial prediction, optogenetic activation of D2 cells contingent on eating decreased ‘liking’ (increased ILI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Unexpectedly, it also increased ‘wanting’ (increased bout number, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>) leading to increased overall consumption (increased number of licks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). This suggests that the ‘wanting’ aspect triggered by optical activation overrode ‘liking’ in driving overall consummatory behavior. Conversely, contrary to our hypothesis, D1 cell activation did not impact overall consumption via effects on either ‘liking’ or ‘wanting’ parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-d</xref>). This would mean that sustained activity of D1 cells beyond the naturally occurring transient increase described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, e</xref> does not promote further ‘liking’, nor does it induce ‘wanting’.</p><p id="P16">Next, we sought to test whether silencing D1 and D2 cells using the inhibitory opsin eNpHR3.0 could also influence consumption of a palatable food. We hypothesized that D1 cell silencing would induce a decrease in consumption, while D2 cell silencing would prolong consumption. However, silencing D1 cells did not lead to a significant decrease in overall consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), but induced a significant increase in ‘liking’ (decreased ILI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) with no significant effect on ‘wanting’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The influence of inhibitory post-ingestive mechanisms such as satiation, which increase as ingestion proceeds, could have been a confounding factor to D1 cell inhibition, because the lick and bout numbers may have already been at their minimum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P17">Inhibition of D2 cells did not lead to any significant difference in lick or bout number compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,d</xref>), suggesting that a further decrease of the natural suppression in activity observed during consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e</xref>) may not be possible and therefore may not yield any stronger consummatory effect.</p><p id="P18">Taken together, these results show that during <italic>ad libitum</italic> consumption, only D2 cell activation leads to an overall increase in eating, and this is mediated by an increase in ‘wanting’, despite a concomitant decrease in ‘liking’. However, a limitation of the <italic>ad libitum</italic> paradigm is that it only examines baseline motivation, and is not designed to evaluate motivation to work for a reward. Therefore, we next probed the role of D1 and D2 cells in a different motivational task, designed to interrogate ‘wanting’.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NAc D1 and D2 cell activity increases with anticipation during a motivational task to retrieve palatable food, which is followed by a D2 cell activity decrease upon consumption onset</title><p id="P19">To probe ‘wanting’ further, we paired a food reward with a cue, which allowed us to investigate the attribution of ‘incentive salience’ to the cue. We exposed mice to a Pavlovian ‘motivation to retrieve a reward’ task in which they received food rewards announced by a sound cue, which they had to retrieve from a food magazine. This did not require the mice to develop learning strategies. This allowed us to monitor three parameters: the number of entries in the food magazine, the time to retrieve and consume the food after cue onset (latency), and the length of food-magazine entries. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Photometry recordings showed sustained increased activity in D2 cells during the approach phase (after food delivery cue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). D1 cells, however, only transiently increased their activity following food delivery cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). An important distinction in the behavior of D1 cell activity must be made: in contrast to the <italic>ad libitum</italic> paradigm where D1 cell signal increased prior to licking onset, here, in a motivational task, the increase in signal was specifically aligned to the reward delivery cue. During food magazine visits, the neural dynamics observed were similar to the first <italic>ad libitum</italic> study, with a sustained decrease in the activity of D2 cells and only a small initial increase in D1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P21">As in the first experiment, we were interested to see if the natural D1 and D2 cell activity held predictive information about components of feeding behavior. Correlation analysis of ‘wanting’ behavioral parameters and D2 cell activity after a food delivery cue revealed that latency to enter food magazine can be well predicted by the average D2 cell activity before the food magazine visit, and by the standard deviation (Std) of the pre-food magazine visit D2 cell signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4a</xref>; the higher the signal before visit, the shorter the latency). This correlation analysis also showed that the number of food magazine visits can be well predicted by the median D2 cell signal before the food magazine visit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4b</xref>; the higher the signal pre-food magazine visit, the more visits occurred). The average length of a food magazine visit was also found to be well predicted by the minimum of D2 cell activity <italic>during</italic> consumption, and by the standard deviation of the signal before the visit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4c</xref>; the lower the minimum, the longer the food magazine visit). D1 cell analysis yielded no significant correlations.</p><p id="P22">Therefore, latency and number of visits correlated with D2 cell signals <italic>before</italic> visits occurred, while the length of a visit was determined by the signals <italic>during</italic> the visit. These data also suggest that suppression of D2 cell activity <italic>during</italic> feeding favors consumption, which was investigated further in the next experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inhibition of D2 or D1 cells reduces motivation to retrieve a food reward, while activation of D1 cells, but not D2 cells, enhances motivation</title><p id="P23">Because both D1 and D2 cells were modulated during the motivation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d,e</xref>), we aimed to causally test the effect of cell-type-specific activation and inhibition on motivated behavior (‘wanting’). We optogenetically manipulated NAc D1 and D2 cells at either food reward delivery cue or at food magazine visit (first visit following a delivery cue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,c</xref>). D2 cell silencing at either food delivery cue, or at food magazine visit significantly decreased number of food magazine entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f,g</xref>), and inhibiting D2 cells after food delivery cue significantly decreased the average length of the subsequent food magazine visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3j</xref>). These results are in line with our photometry findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>, <bold>right</bold>) suggesting a role for D2 cell activity in the anticipation of a food reward (‘wanting’). Optogenetic activation of D1 cells at either food delivery cue or at food magazine visit significantly increased the number of food magazine entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f,g</xref>). Moreover, silencing D1 cells during the food delivery cue increased the average latency to food magazine entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>). Combined with photometry findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d,e</xref>, <bold>left</bold>), these findings about D1 cells suggest that their activity causes a higher incentive motivation to approach the palatable food, making the mice more focused on obtaining the reward and more reactive to the cue.</p><p id="P24">Together, our data indicate that both D1 and D2 cell activity during the food approach code and control incentive motivation or ‘wanting’.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Modulation of NAc D1 but not D2 cells influences hedonic preference learning (hedonic shifting)</title><p id="P25">Our two previous experimental paradigms showed that consumption of a palatable food elicits, as expected, ‘liking’ responses. We next investigated whether pairing a flavored palatable food, constituting a conditioned stimulus (CS), with optogenetic stimulation (unconditioned stimulus, US) of either D1 or D2 cells could shift natural preference for one flavor to another. We hypothesized that optogenetic stimulation of either population would establish a learned preference for the least innately preferred flavor by increasing the hedonic value (‘liking’) of the CS (flavored food).</p><p id="P26">To assess innate preference, mice were first presented with two bottles, each containing a different flavor, but with identical nutritional composition (‘pre-test’). The least preferred flavor was then coupled to optogenetic stimulation of either D1 or D2 cells during a daily conditioning session over several days, while the preferred flavor was presented unpaired with optogenetic stimulation in a separate daily session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Following conditioning, we performed a ‘choice-test’ to determine if the paired flavor was now able to trigger incentive motivation (‘wanting’) and become equally, or possibly more, attractive than the previously preferred, unpaired flavor. During conditioning, increased consumption from the paired flavor over the unpaired one would indicate a hedonic change (‘liking’). During the choice test, with respect to the ‘liking’/‘wanting’ hypothesis, disruption of a reward-oriented behavior by optogenetic manipulation of the NAc could, in principle, be due to a disruption of either ‘liking’ or ‘wanting’ or, presumably, a combination of both.</p><p id="P27">During optogenetic activation of D2 cells, consumption of the paired and unpaired flavors across the conditioning phase did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Note that during this conditioning phase, each flavor was presented in separate sessions, hence the absence of difference between the amounts consumed, unlike the difference observed in the ‘pre-test’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5a</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). However, optogenetic stimulation of D1 cells led to a gradual increase in the consumption of the paired flavor, so that the mice consumed larger amounts of food in the late paired conditioning sessions compared to GFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). During the choice-test, an increase in consumption of the paired flavor compared to the pre-test levels was noted while a decrease was observed in the unpaired flavor, leading to significantly different ‘choice-test – pre-test’ deltas between the two flavors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). There was no significant change in preference in control GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, <bold>right</bold>), suggesting repeated exposure to the flavors did not alter preference.</p><p id="P28">In addition, we used lick microstructure analysis to assess potential changes in ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ produced by flavor preference conditioning. During the conditioning sessions, stimulation of D1, but not D2 cells increased ‘liking’ (increased lick duration and decreased inter-lick duration) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a,b</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). This indicates an increased palatability of the flavor paired with D1 cell optostimulation, which is of relevance because conditioned increases in palatability have been shown to be important for driving overeating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Moreover, inter-bout interval (IBI) decreased over conditioning sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>, <bold>left</bold>), indicating an increase in ‘wanting’, while motivation to consume the unpaired flavor decreased over sessions, as indicated by decreasing bout numbers and initially increasing IBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,d</xref>, <bold>middle</bold>). During the choice-test, when both flavors were once again presented simultaneously, with no optogenetic stimulation on either of the flavors at this stage), licking microstructure indicated an increased ‘liking’ of the paired flavor (higher lick duration, and lower ILI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a,b</xref>, <bold>right</bold>).

In a free palatable food consumption paradigm, a dual role of D2 cells is linked to both ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’: increased D2 cell activity signals ‘wanting’ and decreased activity enhances ‘liking’, with the magnitude of natural inhibition following palatable food consumption being a good predictor for ‘liking’. In contrast, D1 cells promote ‘liking’ during the free consumption. In the operant task, we showed that D1 cell activity after cue and right after eating onset drives the motivation to retrieve palatable food, while reduced activity of D2 cells after food magazine visits drives the motivation to remain in the magazine. Lastly, we show that D1 cell stimulation induced hedonic shifting in a Pavlovian task, leading to overconsumption of palatable food. This effect was specific to D1 cells, as stimulation of D2 cells during opto-paired food conditioning had no effect across conditioning days or during the choice test.</p><sec id="S9"><title>The role of NAc D1 and D2 cells during periods of free consumption of palatable food</title><p id="P31">The NAc is part of a neural circuit governing consumption of palatable food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and neuronal subpopulations in the NAc shell encode rewarding stimuli and palatability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Pharmacological manipulations in rodents and in hyper-dopaminergic knockout mice showed that ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ sucrose could be separated with an increase in ‘wanting’ but a constant decrease in ‘liking’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and that ‘wanting’ was increased with prolonged sucrose consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Here, using photometry and optogenetics, we showed a differential role between NAc D1 and D2 cells during free consumption of a palatable food. Activity of NAc D2 cells was linked to both ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ but with opposing actions; high D2 cell activity signaled ‘wanting’, and low D2 cell activity enhanced ‘liking’. Importantly, the increased activity in D2 cells was similar across milkshake sessions, whereas inhibition of this signaling following the onset of milkshake consumption was greater after repeated milkshake sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). A multiple regression analysis indicated that this magnitude of inhibition (area under the curve) after consumption was a good predictor for ‘liking’ (bout duration, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2b</xref>). Previous findings showed that during consumption of sucrose, a decrease in firing rate in a subset of NAc neurons immediately before and during a lick bout is required to initiate and maintain consummatory behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. The present study supports the idea that sustained D2 cell depression maintains the actions resulting in palatable food consumption and hedonic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. We showed that D1 cells on the other hand promote ‘liking’ right after consumption onset. D1 receptors have been shown to play a role in incentive learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], and so may be important during the initial phase of instrumental learning, when reward is novel and unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] and in the primary response to drugs of abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. This may explain why D1 cell activity was highest during the first milkshake session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Supporting this interpretation, in a multiple regression analysis, the maximum D1 cell signal following lick onset was a significant predictor of bout duration; the larger the initial increase, the longer the licking bout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Contribution of NAc D1 and D2 cells to reward-associated cues</title><p id="P32">D1 and D2 cells displayed distinct temporal activity during food magazine visits in the motivational task; D1 cell activity increased after onset of the food delivery cue, whereas D2 cell activity was increased before, but suppressed after, food magazine entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). These results are in line with previous findings from drug-addiction literature showing that NAc D1 cells increase their activity before entering a drug-paired chamber, while D2 cells decrease their activity after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Thus it may be that in our task, D1 cell activity drives the motivation to enter the food magazine, while reduced activity of D2 cells after food magazine visit onset would drive the motivation to remain in the magazine. This might suggest that D1, but not D2 cell signaling drives reward- and reinforcement-related behaviors. In particular, we show a causal role of temporally specific cue-elicited D1 cell signaling, which may further demonstrate the role of this cell type in motivation to retrieve rewards. Activation of D1 cells when animals entered the food magazine or at cue-onset increased the number of food magazine visits. This may imply that the D1 cell signals guide animals to seek reward, whereas suppressing D1 cell activity at either food magazine or cue onset does not lead to any changes in the number of visits compared to the control group. However, inhibition of D1 cells at cue onset delayed approach. D1 cell activity may thus drive higher incentive motivation to reach the palatable food (reward) by increasing focus on the cue, and amplifying ‘wanting’ for a particular incentive target (the highly-caloric palatable food). This could contribute to intense urges to indulge in those foods, leading to overeating. Attenuating or eliminating D1 cell signals may decrease the associative learning of environmental stimuli (reward-associated cue) with reward. Our experiments were conducted once the animals learnt the association between cue and reward and the neuronal response that was measured was to the reward-predictive cue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Pharmacological studies investigating the role of NAc D1 and D2 receptors in response to drugs of abuse have also shown that both D1 and D2 receptors have a role in associative learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Dopamine responses to cues predicting drug availability can lead to drug seeking behavior and over time these responses to drug-associated cues are dampened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Our findings regarding D1 cells in the context of associative learning are in line with previous publications demonstrating that D1-like receptors are essential in reward related learning including instrumental learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] as well as driving motivation to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. More specifically, systemic administration as well as local infusion into the NAc of dopamine D1-like receptor antagonists have been shown to attenuate food-reinforced lever pressing and to dampen the rewarding effects of palatable food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of NAc D1 cells enhanced drug-induced conditioned place preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>].

This indicates that D1 cell optostimulation induced a hedonic preference via an association between the flavor and the rewarding effects of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). This was not observed in control mice. In addition, during the conditioning sessions with D1 cell optostimulation, an increase in time spent consuming the opto-paired flavor was observed across sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). This may reflect a hedonic experience which alters associative hedonic/‘liking’ processes by selectively enhancing D1 cell activity. This facilitates the association between flavor and opto-stimulation and promotes hedonic shifting that in turn leads to increased consumption of that flavor as observed in the choice test. This effect was specific for NAc D1 cells; stimulation of NAc D2 cells during conditioning had no effect either across conditioning days, or on the choice test.</p><p id="P35">In this experiment we were able to induce a learned shift in preference for a particular flavor when D1 cell optogenetic stimulation was coupled with a less preferred flavor. This is based on a Pavlovian association formed between NAc D1 cell activation (US) and the least preferred flavor (CS), which changed the taste preference to that flavor. This suggests that hedonic ‘liking’ of a flavor stimulus can be determined not only by flavor itself, but also by the relevant ‘brain’ state at the time of formation of Pavlovian associations, for example by a change in perceived palatability. In a similar manner, in the context of drug addiction, it was shown that NAc D1 cell activity preceding entry to the drug-paired compartment in a conditioned place preference test is needed for drug-associative learning to take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>].</p><p id="P36">That our findings are not always in line with previous literature may reflect the discordance between previous studies themselves: the precise NAc subregion targeted plays a role in the results obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], the pattern (frequency, length) of the optogenetic modulation pattern also has an impact on the direction of the effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], and the experimental paradigm also plays a crucial role depending on the cues and responses it entails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Clinical implications for the role of NAc D1 and D2 cell activity in ‘liking’ versus ‘wanting’ in overconsumption and eating disorders</title><p id="P37">Our findings have potential implications for human eating disorders. ‘Hedonic eating’ does not necessarily involve pleasure, but can also be driven by a motivation to eat which can be dissociated from the drive caused by a nutrient deficit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. It is already well known that in humans, high-calorie foods, especially sweet and fatty ones, promote overconsumption. The incentive theory of ‘liking’/‘wanting’ is significant in the study of food intake regulation, modelling associations between the function of the reward system and feeding or obesity. Studies tried to show that different neural mechanisms are responsible for ‘wanting’ a certain food than ‘liking’ it. For more than a decade, human studies of obesity have used ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ to try to better understand how ‘wanting’ food can differ in some individuals, and override ‘liking’ to cause excessive cue-trigged ‘wanting’ (craving) that will drive overeating and lead to obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. Incentive sensitization theory, originally postulated for drug addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>], was then applied to eating disorders to try to explain how some individuals may experience ‘wanting’ to eat palatable foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

We incorporated observation, inhibition and excitation of NAc D1 and D2 cells, multiple behavioral paradigms investigating different aspects of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’, including analysis of lick microstructure, and multivariate analysis. In summary, we show that NAc D1 cell activity plays a role in reinforced behaviors induced by palatable foods in an operant paradigm or a Pavlovian association test. However, in a palatable food free-access paradigm D1 cells encode only the hedonic property of the palatable food. NAc D2 cells on the other hand, have a role in the drive to retrieve food, showing elevated activity prior to eating onset in a motivational task. Once eating starts, suppressed D2 cell activity allows for prolonged eating episodes. This would support the idea that evolutionary processes led to these two cell populations that can independently and mutually influence hedonic eating. D1 cells are prone to lead to a maladaptive cycle of increased ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’, thus driving overeating, while D2 cells cannot reinforce both processes and are faced with a tradeoff between increasing ‘wanting’ by being more active or allowing ‘liking’ by remaining silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

A subset of 8 parameters depicting the photometry signal around a licking bout onset was selected: maximum, minimum and area under the curve (AUC) in the 5 secs following lick onset; mean and median signal over the 3 sec before lick onset; mean and median signal over the 3 sec following lick onset and standard deviation of the non-z-scored signal in the 5 sec preceding lick onset. Because aiming to fit too many variables in a regression model can lead to spurious results, we used all parameters simultaneously in a first step only, to assess correlations between predictors and see which predictors had the highest and most significant correlations with the outcome variable. If predictors were highly correlated between themselves (Pearson’s r &gt;8.5, VIF&gt;10, tolerance&lt;0.1, checking expression of each predictor in eigen vector base) then only the predictor with the most significant correlation with the outcome variable was kept. Then, in a second step, another linear regression was performed keeping only the non-collinear predictors. A final blockwise (hierarchical) regression was done keeping only the predictors that showed significant correlations with the outcome variable and/or model coefficients significantly different from 0. This final block-wise approach – which started with the predictor yielding the highest significant standardized model parameter (β) and continued in decreasing order of βs – allowed us to evaluate from which predictor adding one more predictor to the model did not yield better predictive power (looking at the p value associated to the F-ratio change). Predictors whose addition to the model gave a significant F-ratio change (i.e., improved the model) are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2-4</xref>. Case-wise diagnostics allowed us to evaluate the adequacy of our dataset, namely whether 95% of data points had standardized residuals within ±2, and around 1% of the sample at most had standardized residuals over 2.5. Assumptions of the model (absence of heteroscedasticity, linearity) were evaluated by plotting standardized residuals against standardized predicted values. Normal distribution was evaluated via the observed vs. predicted cumulative probability plots. The Durbin-Watson index was used to evaluate whether the model’s residuals were independent (index should be as close to 2 as possible, and at least &gt;1 and &lt;3). As our aim here was to evaluate which aspects of the photometry signal (i.e., neuronal activity) best predicted ‘liking’ and/or ‘wanting’, but not to apply the model to future datasets, we did not use bootstrapping. Nonetheless, to assess the validity of our model for a general population, cross-validation was performed using the ‘adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value.’ A value as close as possible to R<sup>2</sup> indicated that the model generalizes well to the population beyond the sample data.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>‘Motivation to retrieve a reward’ task analysis</title><p id="P66">When analyzing photometry signals around food delivery, trials where the mouse entered the food magazine within 5 sec after food delivery cue were not included so that signals did not include food consumption, but only food anticipation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Therefore, since sex was not the primary independent variable of interest in this study, and given the lack of statistical differences, we pooled data from both sexes for all further analyses. Tests and their results are presented in the figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean ± SEM, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.

NAc D1 cells show transient activation following a reward-predicting cue (left, blue dotted line) and following consumption onset (right, turquoise dotted line). The amplitude of increase following feeding onset diminishes with daily repeated exposure to the food reward (grey line and orange arrow, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3d,e</xref>). NAc D2 cells show a sustained increase in activity following a food-predicting cue and their activity drops following feeding onset; this drop becomes lower during the consumption bout and with repeated daily exposure to the food reward (orange arrow).</p><p>(b) Hypothetical model of the mutual relationship between approaching (‘wanting’) and consuming (‘liking’) reward behaviors, and NAc D1 and D2 cell activity. NAc D1 cell activation induces both ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ processes (yellow arrows), and D1 cells are naturally activated during behaviors associated with ‘wanting’ and/or ‘liking’ (grey arrows). NAc D2 cell activation, on the other hand, leads to increased ‘wanting’ and decreased ‘liking’ (yellow arrows). Behaviors associated with ‘wanting’, e.g., following a food-predicting cue and during food approach, lead to an increase in D2 cell activity, while behaviors associated with ‘liking’, e.g., during food consumption, lead to a sustained decrease in D2 cell activity in the NAc.</p><p>(c) Considering ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ as a 2D space underlying hedonic eating, our data show that D1 and D2 cells, if expressed in a binary manner, are orthogonal in that space and can themselves form a base of this 2D space. This would support the idea that evolutionary processes led to these two cell populations that can independently and mutually influence hedonic eating. D1 cells are prone to lead to a maladaptive cycle of increased ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’, thus driving overeating, while D2 cells cannot reinforce both processes and are faced with a tradeoff between increasing ‘wanting’ by being more active or allowing ‘liking’ by remaining silent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156499-f006"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Mice implanted in each group and line.</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-left: hidden: border-top: hidden: border-right: hidden"/><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top: hidden: border-right: hidden">Adora2a-cre</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top: hidden: border-right: hidden">D1-cre</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-left: hidden: border-bottom: hidden"><italic>Photometry – GCaMP6s</italic></td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#ededed">6 (4m + 2f)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#ededed">6 (3m + 3f)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-left: hidden: border-bottom: hidden"><italic>Optogenetics – ChrimsonR</italic></td><td align="center" valign="middle">5 (3m + 2f)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">6 (3m + 3f)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-left: hidden: border-bottom: hidden"><italic>Optogenetics – eNpHR3.0</italic></td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#ededed">6 (3m + 3f)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#ededed">6 (3m + 3f)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-left: hidden: border-bottom: hidden"><italic>Optogenetics – GFP</italic></td><td align="center" valign="middle">6 (3m + 3f)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">6 (3m + 3f)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
