The highly conserved extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) is a key node connecting these essential processes, as well as playing a critical role in coordinating cell fate specification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Understanding the regulation and output of Erk signaling is therefore crucial for understanding its role in development as well as in adult homeostasis and disease. Thus, the development of sensitive methods of visualizing signaling Erk dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> is essential.</p><p id="P3">Functioning downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptors, Erk signaling can elicit different cellular responses depending on context and upstream ligand-receptor combinations that can be associated with distinct signaling dynamics. For example, treatment of rat PC-12 cells with EGF (epidermal growth factor) induces transient signaling which promotes proliferation, while NGF (nerve growth factor) induces sustained signaling that promotes differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Introducing regular pulses of EGF, rather than sustained addition, is sufficient to convert EGF to a pro-differentiation signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, while short-term sustained Erk signaling (~30 min) promotes neural fate in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm, longterm sustained (≥60 min) or frequent pulses of Erk activity promote endodermal fate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. It is therefore proposed that information is encoded within Erk dynamics through the accumulative dose of Erk activity. The advent of Erk biosensors is now enabling the interrogation of Erk dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>, and recent work has similarly suggested a role for sustained versus pulsatile signaling in mouse ESC differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This highlights the importance of elucidating the role of Erk signaling dynamics in the regulation of cellular identity and behaviour.</p><p id="P4">The zebrafish embryo presents an ideal model system to monitor signaling dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> and previous studies have successfully employed Erk biosensors in the study of wounding and vasculogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. During early zebrafish development, the patterns and roles of Fibroblast growth factor Fgf/Erk signaling are well characterised, as successive rounds of signaling pattern first the dorsoventral (DV) axis and then the anteroposterior (AP) axis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Between 3.3 and 3.6 hours post fertilization (hpf) (mid-blastula stage), a discrete domain of <italic>fgf8a</italic>, <italic>fgf3</italic> and <italic>fgf24</italic> expression and corresponding P-Erk gradient is induced by Nodal signaling in the presumptive dorsal organizer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Between 4.3 and 5.3 hpf, Nodal signaling induces expression of <italic>fgf3/8a</italic> in the marginal-most cells to drive long-range Erk signaling around the embryonic margin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Together, overlapping short-range Nodal and long-range Fgf/Erk signaling induce and pattern the mesodermal and endodermal lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, snap-shot views of development show a highly heterogeneous pattern of Erk activity, as read out by levels of diphosphorylated Erk (P-Erk) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This pattern suggests heterogeneity in either the single cell response to Fgf signaling or in Erk signaling dynamics over time.</p><p id="P5">Here we report the generation of a highly specific and sensitive reporter of Erk signaling, through the modification of the Erk-Kinase Translocation Reporter (KTR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> that abolishes the reporter’s responses to Cdk1. We hereafter refer to the biosensor as modErk-KTR. These KTR reporters use site-specific phosphorylation by the target kinase to regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a fluorescent protein. We demonstrate the highly specific sensitivity of the modErk-KTR to Erk signaling in zebrafish embryonic tissues, as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic and larval tissues. Furthermore, we monitor the growth and collapse, following inhibition of signaling, of the Fgf/Erk signaling gradient in the zebrafish blastula. We identify oscillations in Erk signaling associated with mitosis, a process we refer to as mitotic erasure, in both zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. This introduces periods of Erk inactivity and couples signaling dynamics to tissue growth, thus providing a source of signaling heterogeneity in an asynchronously dividing tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Design</title><p id="P6">We observe off-target Erk-KTR activity during early development that we demonstrate is due to Cdk1 activity. Indeed studies with other Erk biosensors reported similar findings that Cdk1 activity can influence reporter readouts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A recent study addressed this issue with the EKAREV FRET sensor by changing the Erk phosphorylation motifs to remove key lysines that mediate Cdk1 recognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The phosphorylation sites of the Erk-KTR are similarly surrounded by lysines, but these residues are essential for the function of the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. It is therefore not possible to modify the Erk-KTR phosphorylation site to reduce Cdk1 interaction. Instead, we have modified a putative cyclin-docking site found within the ELK1-derived Erk docking domain to reduce cyclin-Cdk1 binding and hence substantially improve Erk-specificity of the biosensor.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Erk-KTR displays Mek/Erk-independent off-target activity in early zebrafish embryos</title><p id="P7">To monitor Erk activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a previously developed transgenic zebrafish line (<italic>ubiP</italic>:Erk-KTR-Clover) where Erk-KTR is ubiquitously expressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The Erk-KTR consists of an N-terminal Erk-docking domain (derived from human ELK1), an NLS containing Erk consensus phosphorylation sites (TP), a nuclear export sequence (NES) and a green fluorescent protein (Clover) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In the absence of activated P-Erk the NLS is dominant, and the reporter concentrates in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Upon Erk activation, phosphorylation of the NLS inhibits its function and the KTR shuttles to the cytoplasm. By measuring the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear (C/N) fluorescence ratio of the reporter, it is possible to measure the real-time levels of Erk activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">First, we established whether Erk-KTR reports the known patterns of Erk activity in the zebrafish blastula. P-Erk is first seen at 3.6 hpf in a small dorsal domain colocalizing with <italic>gsc</italic> and <italic>fgf8a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). By 5.3 hpf, P-Erk is detected throughout the embryonic margin in both deep cells (DCs) and the enveloping layer (EVL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. To aid the visualization of the Erk-KTR readout, we false-colored embryos in a binary manner to show enrichment in the cytoplasm (green; C:N &gt; 1) or nucleus (magenta; C:N ≤ 1), which indicate high and low Erk activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). At 3.3 hpf, the reporter shows strong nuclear localization throughout the blastoderm indicating no Erk activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, from 3.6 hpf we observed sporadic nuclear exclusion throughout the blastoderm, and most cells showed uniform nuclear exclusion by 4.0 hpf, including both DCs and the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). By 6.0 hpf, nuclear exclusion of the reporter becomes restricted to the margin, but it was still observed beyond the Fgf/Erk signaling domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S1</xref>). To test whether Erk-KTR localization was Erk-dependent, we measured C/N ratios at both the margin (high Fgf/Erk) and animal pole (no Fgf/Erk; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) following treatment from 4.0 to 5.0 hpf with an inhibitor of Mek (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase), the upstream activator of Erk (10 μM PD-0325901; MEKi). This caused a small but significant decrease in C/N ratios at both the margin and animal pole in comparison with vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). However, Erk-KTR remained enriched in the cytoplasm in treated embryos, indicating significant Mek/Erk-independent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the zebrafish blastula.</p><p id="P9">Previous studies have used the Erk-KTR to monitor signaling dynamics at later stages of development (≥ 24 hpf) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and we observed that by 6.0 hpf the reporter more accurately reflected the expected pattern of Erk signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that the Mek/Erk-independent shuttling might be driven by some phenomenon occurring during early development. We noted that the onset of reporter mislocalization correlated well with cell cycle remodeling at the midblastula transition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This is driven by lengthening of the cell cycle, which is influenced by changes in Cdc25-Cdk1 activity in zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether Erk-KTR localization was influenced by cell cycle inputs by treating cells with a CDK1-specific inhibitor (20 μM RO-3306; CDK1i). Treatment had no effect on Erk-KTR C/N ratios at the margin, however, there was a significant reduction in C/N ratios animally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Treatment with both MEKi and CDK1i resulted in maximal nuclear localization at the margin. Together, these data show that the localization of Erk-KTR is controlled by a combination of Erk and Cdk1. We propose that the rapid, short cell cycles (every 15–30 min) of early development emphasize this due to an increased frequency of high Cdk1 activity, masking the true pattern of Erk signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>modERK-KTR: a modified Erk-KTR with improved specificity</title><p id="P10">To enable the monitoring of Fgf/Erk signaling dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated an improved Erk biosensor devoid of Cdk1 responsiveness (modErk-KTR). To achieve this, we introduced an R&gt;A substitution within a putative cyclin-docking site (RxLxΦ, where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) in the Erk-docking domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This would be predicted to significantly reduce cyclin-substrate binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, but may also weakly reduce Erk binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We therefore introduced another Erk docking site (FQFP) at the C-terminus of the ELK1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">We initially characterized modErk-KTR in NIH-3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts to ensure our modifications had not compromised the biosensor’s Erk sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, NIH-3T3 cells divide infrequently, particular with serum starvation, and so will display minimal Cdk1-dependent effects on KTR localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Following overnight serum starvation, cells displayed a baseline low C/N ratio indicative of low/no ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Upon addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), we observed a rapid increase in C/N ratio for both biosensors within ~5 min, which could be inhibited within 15–30 min with MEKi (10 μM PD-0325901) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Videos S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>). Both displayed similar activation kinetics; however, modErk-KTR exhibited a sharper decline in C/N ratios in response to MEKi showing increased responsivity, although both displayed a similar degree of inhibition by 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also observed a serum concentration-dependent response of modErk-KTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Addition of a high concentration of serum (10% FBS) elicited a rapid, sustained increase in C/N ratios over 1.5 hr. By comparison, a low concentration of serum (2% FBS) elicited a slower response with reduced amplitude, as well as more transient and oscillatory dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). If no serum was added baseline C/N ratio was sustained over a similar time course with some low-level sporadic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data show that modErk-KTR responds to Mek/Erk activity and captures the full range of Erk signaling dynamics <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P12">Next we tested the functionality of modErk-KTR <italic>in vivo</italic> by generating <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ubiP</italic>:modErk-KTR-Clover) transgenic zebrafish and firstly asking whether modErk-KTR faithfully reported the domains of Fgf/Erk signaling in DV and AP axis patterning using the binary classification of KTR localisation described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). At 3.3 hpf, the reporter showed strong nuclear localization throughout the blastoderm indicating no Erk activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), similarly to Erk-KTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). From 3.6 hpf, unlike Erk-KTR, we observed high C/N ratios of modErk-KTR restricted to a discrete domain in marginal cells, representing the presumptive dorsal organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, Ai and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Video S4</xref>). From 4.6 hpf, this domain of high C/N ratios expanded to encompass the embryonic margin, including both DCs and EVL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S1A</xref>) with very few animal cells showing high C/N ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video S5</xref>). In addition, the width of the gradient of high C/N ratios progressively expanded from 4.6 to 5.3 hpf but remained limited to the marginal cells up until 6.0 hpf. In summary, a qualitative view of zebrafish blastulae shows that modErk-KTR recapitulates the expected patterns of Fgf/Erk activity.</p><p id="P13">To address whether the observed reporter activity is solely Mek/Erk-dependent, we monitored KTR localization at the margin and animal pole following treatment with MEKi, CDK1i or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Treatment from 4.0 hpf for 1 hr with MEKi caused a significant decrease in the C/N ratio at the margin in comparison with the vehicle control but had no effect on cells at the animal pole. Conversely, we observed no effect on reporter localization following addition of CDK1i, while MEKi and CDK1i together lead to a similar decrease in the C/N ratio as the MEKi alone. Importantly, we did not observe cells with high C/N ratios at the animal pole, or indeed any effect, after adding inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). This suggests that the KTR modifications have successfully extinguished the Cdk1 sensitivity in zebrafish.</p><p id="P14">To further confirm the functionality of modErk-KTR as a readout of Fgf signaling, we ubiquitously overexpressed Fgf8a or dominant negative Fgf receptor (dnFgfR) and monitored KTR localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Overexpression of Fgf8a resulted in no further increase in C/N ratio in the most marginal cells, but we observed a significant increase animally, with the embryos showing uniformly high C/N ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of dnFgfR significantly reduced C/N ratios in the most marginal cells, consistent with the reduction in P-Erk levels shown previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, while having no effect on cells at the animal pole. modErk-KTR is therefore a faithful readout of Fgf/Erk signaling in the zebrafish blastula.</p><p id="P15">We next wanted to test the utility of modErk-KTR as a general biosensor of Erk signaling in other <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts. Previous studies have used the Erk-KTR to monitor Erk response in muscle cell wounding at 48 hpf <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, multinucleated muscle cells are post-mitotic and therefore, they should be free of Cdk1-dependent influence on reporter localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We carried out a wounding assay in both Erk-KTR and modErk-KTR transgenic embryos and compared their Erk-dependent response. At homeostasis, muscle cells at 48 hpf did not display any Erk activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S1B</xref>) but rapid shuttling of the reporter out of the nucleus was observed in muscle cells surrounding the wound within 15 min of wounding with both reporters. Therefore, at this later stage of development the two reporters appear to function similarly.</p><p id="P16">Finally, we compared the two reporters in other developing tissues where there is well characterized Fgf signaling. We observed that modErk-KTR displayed clear nuclear exclusion in the developing eye and tailbud presomitic mesoderm - sites of known Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S1C</xref>). Furthermore, we performed the same comparison in 24 hpf embryos where the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) is a source of Fgf signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Fgf ligands (e.g. <italic>fgf3</italic>) are expressed in a discrete domain at the MHB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S2A</xref>) while Fgf target genes, such as <italic>pea3, erm1</italic> and <italic>sprouty4</italic>, are expressed in broader domains suggesting that secreted Fgf ligands act at some distance from their source <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To test the functionality of the KTR reporters in this context, Erk activity was measured at 24 hpf anteriorly from the MHB in the midbrain using H2B-mScarlet-I (H2B-mSc) as a nuclear marker. Using Erk-KTR, we observed generally high C/N ratios throughout the midbrain and only observed a minimal reduction at 200 μm away from the source of Fgf ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S2B and D</xref>). By comparison, modErk-KTR read out a steeper gradient with a stepwise feature of C/N ratios, with highest C/N ratios observed at MHB and a plateau at 75–150 μm before decreasing again at 150–200 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S2C, D</xref>). While we were not able here to directly visualize P-Erk levels through conventional immunostaining in this tissue, we noted a similar difference (uniformly high versus graded C/N ratios) in Erk activity readout here as that in 4.0–6.0 hpf embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In conclusion, modErk-KTR displays improved Erk specificity in zebrafish embryos and can be used to monitor Erk signaling in a wide variety of developmental contexts <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An improved reporter system for <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic and larval tissues</title><p id="P18">Recently Erk-KTR was adapted for use in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and used to monitor ERK activity in several larval and adult tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. It was also further developed to include a histone marker (Histone 2Av (H2Av)-mCherry) produced from the same coding sequence but separated by a self-cleaving T2A peptide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The presumed equimolar concentrations of KTR:H2Av enable the readout of ERK activity by nuclear fluorescence alone in contexts where cells are densely packed and the measuring of cytoplasmic fluorescence becomes difficult <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We asked whether modErk-KTR would offer an improvement in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, particularly during early development where reporter localization could be influenced by rapid cell cycles. To test this, we generated new transgenic lines with modERK-KTR and H2Av-mCherry separated by a T2A peptide (modERK-KTR-Clover-T2A-H2Av-mCherry) under the control of a <italic>UAS</italic> or <italic>nanos</italic> promoter (<italic>nosP</italic>) for tissue specific and maternal expression, respectively.

To determine whether the KTRs enable the visualization of these signaling gradients, we imaged embryos from cell cycle (cc) 13 to cc14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S3A, B</xref>). We would predict if the reporters accurately read out ERK activity, we should observe nuclear exclusion at the poles and nuclear accumulation medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, ERK-KTR shows only low-level nuclear accumulation throughout the length of the embryo with nuclear exclusion at the poles during cc13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3A</xref>). This suggests that ERK-KTR does not accurately read out ERK activity, similarly to what we observe in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). By cc14, coincident with significant lengthening of the cell cycle, ERK-KTR localization was consistent with the pattern of ERK activity: nuclear accumulation of ERK-KTR was evident in mediolateral regions while it was excluded from the nucleus in cells at both poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. By contrast, during both cc13 and cc14 modERK-KTR displayed the predicted pattern of nuclear exclusion at both poles and nuclear accumulation mediolaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Videos S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S7</xref>).

However, the correlation between P-ERK levels and HisAv/KTR ratios for modERK-KTR showed an improved linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6101). Indeed, we took advantage of the fact that cells in the eye disc are arrested in G1 phase in the morphogenetic furrow before some cells re-enter the cell cycle. Therefore, examining cells just posterior to the furrow and labeling S-phase cells via EdU incorporation, we could directly compare KTR localization in G1 versus S-phase cells. We focused on P-ERK-negative cells in which the KTR should be predominantly localized to the nucleus. Using ERK-KTR, we observed cells with similarly low levels of P-ERK that varied in KTR localization: EdU-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S4A</xref>; white dashed lines) had lower nuclear KTR fluorescence than P-ERK-negative/EdU-negative neighbouring cells (yellow dashed lines). Thus, the cell cycle stage of cells influenced ERK-KTR localization. By contrast, modERK-KTR displayed similar nuclear enrichment in cells that were P-ERK-negative, irrespective of cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S4A</xref>). To further examine the cell cycle dependence of ERK-KTR, we compared the readout of the reporters in the ovarian germline. In the germarium, the structure that houses the germline stem cells and their progeny, ERK signaling is restricted to the somatic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Early germ cells therefore provide a proliferative but completely P-ERK-negative background in which the KTRs should be localized exclusively to the nucleus. Both reporters show similar degrees of nuclear accumulation in egg chamber germ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure.

Firstly, we imaged the lateral region of <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ubiP</italic>:modErk-KTR-Clover) embryos from 4.3 hpf, at which point Erk activity is restricted to the dorsal organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Embryos were imaged every 5 mins for 1.5 hr and C/N ratios were measured relative to distance from the margin and presented at 20 min intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cells were binned into cell tiers from the margin (YSL = 0) and we noted that during this period of development, cells undergo a change in size due to proliferation (24 to 18 μm width; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5A, B</xref>). Thus, the size of a single cell tier reduced over time (see methods). At 4.3 hpf, there was little to no cytoplasmic enrichment observed in the lateral region, as expected, but by 4.6 hpf the first 4 cell tiers (~100 μm) from the margin began to show slightly higher C/N ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). We note that the first cell tier (~25 μm) exhibited lower C/N ratios in comparison with cells further from margin. By 5.0 hpf, the gradient had expanded to eight cell tiers (~175 μm; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5C</xref>) and by 5.3 hpf the full 10 cell tier (~200 μm; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5C</xref>) gradient had formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, we observed a high degree of variability in the level of Erk activity across the gradient and at each time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5D</xref>). This shows that the response of presumptive mesendodermal cells to Fgf signaling is heterogeneous, which is supported by our recent work showing similar heterogeneity in P-Erk levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">We found that the lower levels of P-Erk in the first three cell tiers, driven by activity of the dual specificity phosphatase Dusp4, were not read out by modErk-KTR by 5.3 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This is unlikely to be due to the sensitivity of modErk-KTR as equivalently low levels of P-Erk are read out in cell tier 6. A more likely explanation is that cell tiers 1-4 have been experiencing Erk activity for 20 min longer than cells further from the margin, therefore, modErk-KTR may read out the accumulative dose of Erk activity over time. To test this possibility, we monitored the rate of Erk deactivation (comparing P-Erk levels and modErk-KTR localization) following the addition of MEKi from 40% epiboly (5.0 hpf). This rate will be determined by the activity of both P-Erk phosphatases and phosphatases that are present that dephosphorylate the reporter.</p><p id="P24">We observed that the majority of P-Erk was dephosphorylated within 10 min of inhibitor addition and after 20 min it was completely extinguished in comparison with the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D, E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Note, cell tiers 1-2 are most sensitive to MEKi and completely lose P-Erk within 10 min. Thus, the presumptive mesendoderm is therefore very sensitive to changes in Fgf/Erk signaling input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Next, we monitored the rate of modErk-KTR response to MEKi. Following addition of DMSO at 40% epiboly, the gradient of KTR C/N localization built up gradually over time to an almost linear slope with highest Erk C/N ratios at the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5E</xref>). In contrast to P-Erk, after addition of MEKi the gradient remained unchanged after 20–30 mins. In fact it was only after 40 mins that cell tiers 1–2 show a decreased C/N ratio and only after 60–70 mins that cell tiers 3–10 show a loss of Erk activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S5E</xref>). This demonstrated that the rate of modErk-KTR dephosphorylation was substantially slower than that of P-Erk in the early zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). We note that this is slower than what we observed in NIH-3T3 cells (~30 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and therefore propose that slow KTR dephosphorylation is an inherent property of the zebrafish embryo. Indeed, this suggests that modErk-KTR reads out the cumulative dose of Erk activity in the first 1–3 cell tiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Nevertheless, the lower levels of P-Erk sensitize these cells to changes in Erk activation.</p><p id="P25">These data demonstrate the utility of modErk-KTR as a live readout of Erk activity during embryonic development and we here demonstrate the formation in live embryos of an Fgf signaling gradient <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mitotic erasure induces oscillatory Fgf/Erk signaling dynamics</title><p id="P26">Heterogeneity in Fgf/Erk signaling is apparent during zebrafish mesendodermal patterning both at the level of P-Erk <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and downstream Erk activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5D</xref>). To address how this heterogeneity arises, we injected one-cell stage embryos with <italic>H2B-mScarlet-I</italic> mRNA and tracked individual nuclei from ~4.6 hpf. We found that as cells approach mitosis there was a rapid (within 2–3 mins) decrease in C/N ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Video S8</xref>).

We confirmed that this is not a reporter artifact, as we also observed a loss of P-Erk in mitotic cells at the zebrafish margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). This appears specific to Fgf/Erk signaling, as Nodal ligand-driven P-Smad2 is maintained throughout mitosis. These data reveal that mitotic erasure of Fgf/Erk signaling induces periods of Erk inactivity.</p><p id="P27">There is a high degree of variability in the period of single cell oscillations around mitosis, specifically in the rate of reactivation post-mitosis (5–45 mins to Log<sub>2</sub>(C/N) &gt;0.25) and the final amplitude of Erk activity. We next asked how these oscillatory dynamics might be influenced. We did not see a clear correlation between the Erk levels of the mother cell (-4 mins) and their daughter cells (+30 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Video S9</xref>) which is likely due to the growth of the Fgf/Erk signaling gradient during this period. There was, however, a positive correlation between sister cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S6C-E</xref>). However, this appears to reflect the temporal Erk dynamics rather than actual levels (i.e. both sisters start with low C/N ratios and both increase over time). However, post-mitotic reactivation rates positively correlated with a cell’s distance from the margin (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>), with those cells in cell tiers 1–4 having the fastest reactivation rate and higher final levels of Erk activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The extracellular distribution of endogenous Fgf8a-GFP at the embryonic margin was recently described and ligand was shown to be concentrated around cell tiers 1–4 (ref 40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S6G</xref>).

In addition, we noticed that cells &gt;4 cell tiers away from the margin appear more mobile and can traverse entire cell tiers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Video S10</xref>). We therefore asked whether the final location of sister cells at +30 min post-mitosis might explain the variability in Erk activity between sister cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S6F</xref>). Indeed, there is a trend for the sister cell that moves away from the margin to exhibit lower levels of Erk activity. However, this is only apparent when sisters have separated by more than a single cell tier (&gt;20 μm).

Here we show that the original Erk-KTR also responds to Cdk1, a problem compounded by a combination of the rapid cell cycles of early development and a slow rate of Erk-KTR dephosphorylation. Despite very discrete patterns of Erk signaling, Erk-KTR localizes to the cytoplasm uniformly in most cells. By comparison, we see similar responses (Erk-KTR vs modErk-KTR) in older differentiated tissue, such as 48-hpf muscle cells, as others have reported in various contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This is likely due to the slower rate of proliferation in later development, and thus more infrequent peaks of Cdk1 activity, during which time Erk-KTR more faithfully reports Erk signaling. However, a direct comparison of P-Erk and KTR activity in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue shows an improvement in correlation, with similar differences in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline and zebrafish hindbrain. Therefore, a lack of Erk specificity will likely pose a general problem when using Erk-KTR to monitor Erk signaling in proliferative cells and tissues. Indeed, a recent study identified the same problem with an Erk FRET reporter, as well as the Erk-KTR, where Cdk1-dependent reporter activity increased in late G2 phase in human colorectal cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. By simply mutating the Erk docking domain to abolish Cyclin/CDK1 binding and inserting an additional Erk docking site, we successfully reduced CDK1 reporter activity to baseline, thereby substantially increasing the specificity of the reporter for Erk activity. Thus, modErk-KTR will be a valuable tool, providing an improved Erk-specific biosensor for use <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>P-Erk vs KTR dynamics</title><p id="P31">Here we have monitored for the first time the formation of the Fgf signaling gradient in the zebrafish blastula. While we observe comparative timings to the growth of the P-Erk gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we note that modErk-KTR, in this context, reports on the accumulative dose of Erk activity. This results in the dampened levels of P-Erk in cell tiers 1 and 2 being saturating and driving optimal modErk-KTR nuclear exclusion by 5.3 hpf. However, we note that despite these saturating levels these cells closest to the margin are more sensitive to fluctuations in Erk signaling levels, as they exhibited a faster response to signal inhibition (MEKi) both with P-Erk levels and modErk-KTR shuttling.</p><p id="P32">We find that the rate of modErk-KTR dephosphorylation is much slower (40–70 min) than that of P-Erk (10–20 min) in the early zebrafish embryo, in contrast to more differentiated cells (~30 min) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. This suggests that here there is little/no robust negative feedback downregulating Erk target phosphorylation. We have previously shown that the P-Erk phosphatase, Dusp4, is highly expressed in the first two cell tiers from the margin and another P-Erk phosphatase Dusp6 is also broadly expressed throughout the margin. As a result, P-Erk is rapidly lost upon inhibition of upstream activators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. modErk-KTR dephosphorylation must be driven by different phosphatases that are present/active at lower levels during early development, but more highly expressed/active in more differentiated cells (for example, mouse embryonic fibroblasts). One likely candidate is calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates ELK1 (ref 43) and was recently shown to regulate Erk-KTR activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This latter study also identified the ubiquitous phosphatase PP2A as a regulator of Erk-KTR localization, although PP2A targets multiple nodes in the MAPK pathway (e.g. Raf, Mek and Erk) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Indeed, the promiscuity of phosphatase catalytic subunits makes it difficult to differentiate direct versus indirect action on targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, though a broad acting phosphatase/s would be an attractive candidate for the rapid shutdown of all MAPK pathway activity.</p><p id="P33">Given the slow rate of KTR dephosphorylation in interphase cells, we propose that modErk-KTR in the early zebrafish embryo reads out the accumulative Erk signaling each cell has experienced. This is clear in the cells closest to the margin that experience dampened P-Erk levels yet display the highest KTR C/N ratios. This can be explained by their experiencing Erk signaling the longest, and the slow rate of modErk-KTR dephosphorylation. It will be important in the future to determine whether this phenomenon is shared by endogenous Erk targets and therefore provides a mechanism of ‘memory-retention’ of past Erk activity.</p><p id="P34">These data highlight a point for consideration when using KTRs: how closely linked are the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rates of the target kinase and its KTR? In the zebrafish blastula, it is unlikely that we would be able to observe any interphase Erk dynamics due to the slow KTR dephosphorylation rate, while in other systems, such as mouse ESCs, frequent pulses (8 pulses/hr) of ERK activity can be registered using the Erk-KTR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. A recent study reported a computational screen for gene circuits that could act as detectors of pulsatile Erk dynamics and identified an incoherent feedforward motif they could use to generate a synthetic reporter, called the READer circuit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Erk signaling is required to induce the circuit, but Erk must be subsequently turned-off for the expression of a fluorescent reporter.

The consistency of Erk inactivation ~3 mins prior to mitosis suggests a link to the G2-M checkpoint and hence couples tissue growth to Fgf/Erk signaling. It has previously been noted that Erk responses are cell cycle sensitive. For example, G1- and S-phases are associated with delayed Erk activation and G2 with robust, rapid sustained signaling in yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, while mouse ESCs display more spontaneous pulses of Erk activity early in the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Although the mechanism of mitotic erasure is currently unknown, the Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatases are attractive putative regulators as they are upregulated in late G2 phase to promote G2-M transition through the regulation of Cdk1 (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).

Conversely, hyperactivation of Erk can either enhance cell cycle entry or induce cell cycle arrest, depending on the levels of activation.

There is also variability independent of distance from the margin between neighbouring and sister cells.

(2020) found that following mitosis FGF/ERK signaling levels diverge, which similarly dictates primitive endoderm versus epiblast differentiation through the ERK-dependent destabilisation of Nanog, a key epiblast-promoting factor. The authors did not observe mitotic erasure in these studies, but this is likely due to differences in temporal resolution. Nevertheless, these results could suggest that mitotic erasure of ERK signaling is a conserved process, that could regulate cell fate decision making.

Importantly, this is not the case in other contexts, including around mitosis in the zebrafish blastula, when both P-Erk and the modErk-KTR are dephosphorylated within 2 min.
