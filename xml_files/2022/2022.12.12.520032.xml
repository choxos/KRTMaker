Even though clinical disease is generally mild in the pediatric population, the overall burden of COVID-19 in this population is substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed for all age groups, including children under 5 years of age. mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are available under emergency use authorization for children 6 months to 5 years of age. These and other injectable vaccines are designed to induce strong systemic immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, which infects and spreads via the respiratory mucosal route. Vaccines with the ability to induce mucosal immunity at the respiratory mucosal entry site are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. To this end, we are using a live-attenuated bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 (B/HPIV3) as a viral vector for intranasal immunization. Recombinant B/HPIV3 was originally developed as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate for intranasal immunization against human parainfluenza virus type 3 [HPIV3] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. HPIV3 is an important pediatric respiratory pathogen in humans, second only to human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children under 5 years of age. HPIV3 circulates globally, causing annual epidemics, and represents an important vaccine target for the pediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The live-attenuated virus B/HPIV3 contains the N, P, M, and L genes of bovine parainfluenza virus (BPIV3), which is attenuated in primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]; the genes expressing the parainfluenza virus surface glycoproteins HN and F, the major neutralizing and protective antigens, were derived from HPIV3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. This chimeric live-attenuated vaccine candidate against HPIV3 was immunogenic and well-tolerated in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. In previous studies, B/HPIV3 was also used as a vector to express the fusion (F) glycoprotein of another human respiratory pathogen, RSV, providing a bivalent HPIV3/RSV vaccine candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. A version of this vaccine candidate was well-tolerated in children &gt;2 months of age [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00686075], and improved versions are in further clinical development as bivalent pediatric vaccines against HPIV3 and RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P4">In a recent study, we introduced the wildtype and a prefusion-stabilized versions of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) into the B/HPIV3 vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccine candidates against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge were evaluated in hamsters, a widely used animal model that supports robust replication of B/HPIV3 vectors and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. We found that a single intranasal dose of the B/HPIV3-vectored vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized version of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (B/HPIV3/S-2P) induced strong serum antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 S and elicited serum antibodies with broad neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 of lineages A, B.1.1.7/Alpha and B.1.351/Beta. While a secreted form of the S-2P stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is widely used in injectable mRNA vaccines and vectored or protein vaccines against COVID-19, a further-stabilized secreted version of S was developed, containing 4 additional proline substitutions [S-6P, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]]. In transient transfection experiments, the expression level of S-6P was about 10-fold higher than that of S-2P, and the overall protein stability and resistance of the S-6P version towards heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaw cycles were increased, identifying the secreted version of S-6P as an improved version of S-2P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P5">We recently showed that B/HPIV3/S-6P is immunogenic and protective in rhesus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Here, we extend our work to (i) evaluate the effects of further stabilization by these four additional proline substitutions within the full-length version of the S protein on expression by B/HPIV3, and (ii) to compare the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P against vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 or Alpha and Beta variants in hamsters, and (iii) to compare the breadth of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response induced by these two S-expressing B/HPIV3 vectors against variants of concern, including three Omicron sublineages.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of B/HPIV3/S-6P and comparison of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P6">We previously used B/HPIV3 to express a prefusion-stabilized version of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Wuhan-Hu1, GenBank MN908947), codon-optimized for human expression, and with the S1/S2 polybasic furin cleavage motif “RRAR” ablated by aa substitutions (RRAR-to-GSAS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]), resulting in B/HPIV3/S-2P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Here, we generated an additional version, B/HPIV3/S-6P, expressing a full-length version of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that had been further stabilized by four additional proline substitutions (aa 817, 892, 899 and 942; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). For expression in B/HPIV3, the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the prefusion-stabilized S proteins were framed by nucleotide adapters containing the BPIV3 gene start and gene end signals for insertion as an additional gene between the BPIV3 N and P ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">B/HPIV3 expressing the S-6P prefusion stabilized version of the S protein was readily recovered from cDNA by reverse genetics. The sequences of all recombinant B/HPIV3 viruses used in this study were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We next compared the stability of S expression of S-2P and S-6P by dual-staining immunoplaque assay, performed with polyclonal hyperimmune antisera against PIV3 antigens (green pseudo-coloring), and against the recombinantly-expressed secreted version of the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein (red pseudo-coloring). B/HPIV3/S-2P plaques appeared heterogeneous in size, while B/HPIV3/S-6P plaques were more homogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In virus stocks grown from eight independent recoveries of B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P, staining for both PIV3 and SARS-CoV-S (yellow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) was obtained for 94.9±3.4% and 96.7±1.7% of plaques, respectively, indicating that both viruses stably expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In Vero cells, which are widely used for vaccine manufacture, multicycle replication of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P was similarly efficient and only slightly delayed compared to B/HPIV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>), while in human lung epithelial A549 cells, replication of both B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P was reduced by about 10-fold compared to B/HPIV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we compared the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S by B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P by Western blot. We infected Vero and human lung epithelial A549 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell with B/HPIV3 or the S-expressing versions, and prepared cell lysates 24 h after infection. Following SDS-PAGE (under reducing and denaturing conditions) and Western blotting using the hyperimmune antiserum against the secreted version of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P or purified HPIV3 virions, we detected the S protein in lysates at a size consistent with the uncleaved S0 precursor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We also evaluated the incorporation of the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P or S-6P protein into B/HPIV3 particles. Vero cell-grown viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients in three independent experiments.

On days 3, 5, and 7 post-immunization (pi), 5 hamsters per group were euthanized to evaluate vaccine virus replication in the respiratory tract. Nasal turbinates (NT) and lung tissue homogenates were prepared, and vaccine virus titers were determined by immunoplaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Additional hamsters from each group were euthanized on days 3 (n=1) and 5 (n=2), and lungs and NT were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Sera were obtained on day 26 pi from 10 animals per group to evaluate the antibody response.</p><p id="P11">Consistent with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], B/HPIV3 replicated well in NT and lungs, with highest titers on day 3 pi (6.5 and 5.9 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). By day 5 pi, B/HPIV3 titers were 20-fold lower in NT, and about 10-fold lower in lungs. B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P also replicated well. On day 3 pi, titers of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P in NT were 30 and 125-fold lower, respectively, compared to the B/HPIV3 empty vector; titers in lungs were 100- and 160-fold lower, respectively, than those of the B/HPIV3 empty vector. By day 5 pi, titers of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P had increased in NT (25- and 50-fold, respectively) and lungs (6- and 20-fold, respectively), consistent with delayed replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract due to the presence of the insert. By day 7 pi, replication of B/HPIV3/S-2P, B/HPIV3/S-6P, and empty vector was very low or, in some animals, undetectable in NT or lungs, reflecting self-limiting replication of the vaccine candidates. We also determined the stability of S-2P and S-6P protein expression during <italic>in vivo</italic> replication by dual-staining immunoplaque assay; 96% of B/HPIV3/S-2P and 98% of B/HPIV3/S-6P plaques from NT and 95% of B/HPIV3/S-2P and 99% of B/HPIV3/S-6P plaques from lungs obtained on day 3 after immunization were positive for S protein; 90% and 98% (NT) or 87% and 96% (lungs) of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P plaques from specimens obtained on day 5 after immunization were positive for the S protein, showing that expression of both versions of the S protein was stably maintained <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P12">We also evaluated antigen expression in the NT and lungs by IHC.

B/HPIV3 antigen was present in columnar epithelial cells lining the nasal mucosa and the bronchioles in tissue from B/HPIV3, B/HPIV3/S-2P, and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals (red arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 S antigen in animals immunized with B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P similarly was present in columnar airway epithelial cells of NT and bronchioles (blue arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). The B/HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2 S immunostaining patterns and intensities in tissues of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals were generally similar. Thus, B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P efficiently infected and expressed the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in columnar epithelial cells of the nasal and bronchial mucosa.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P elicited strong serum anti-S and anti-RBD IgG and IgA responses in hamsters</title><p id="P13">To evaluate immunogenicity and protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, 45 hamsters per group were immunized intranasally with 5.0 log<sub>10</sub> PFU of B/HPIV3/S-2P, B/HPIV3/S-6P, or B/HPIV3 empty vector (Experiment #2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We evaluated serum antibody responses 26 or 27 days after intranasal immunization. First, we measured SARS-CoV-2 S-specific serum IgG and IgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>) by ELISA using as antigens the secreted form of the S-2P protein (left panels) and a fragment (aa 319-591) of the S protein bearing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (right panels). Intranasal immunization with B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P elicited strong serum anti-S and anti-RBD IgG and IgA responses in hamsters; the geometric mean (GMT) anti-S and anti-RBD IgG titers in the B/HPIV3/S-6P group were significantly higher (1.5-fold, P&lt;0.01, and 2.4-fold, P&lt;0.001) than those induced by B/HPIV3/S-2P. The GMT anti-RBD IgA titers in the B/HPIV3/S-6P group were also significantly higher than those induced by B/HPIV3/S-2P (1.4-fold, P&lt;0.05), while the difference in anti-S IgA titers did not reach the level of significance. We also evaluated the serum antibody response in animals from Experiment #1 (n=10 per group, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), confirming that B/HPIV3/S-6P elicited higher anti-RBD IgG and IgA responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>; P&lt;0.05). In Experiment #1, the differences in the anti-S IgG and IgA responses between B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P did not reach the level of statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we evaluated the serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody responses using the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref> for Experiment #1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, left panel for Experiment #2). We also evaluated virus neutralizing antibody titers to two variants of concern (VoCs; B.1.1.7/Alpha and B.1.351/Beta) in live-virus neutralization assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, right panels). B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P induced robust serum neutralizing antibody titers against all three viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, we randomly selected 10 sera per group to measure antibodies to B.1.617.2/Delta and B.1.1.529/Omicron variants in a pseudotype neutralization assay (Biosafety level (BSL) 2); in both groups, we detected robust B.1.617.2/Delta pseudotype-inhibiting titers; B.1.1.529/Omicron pseudotype-inhibiting titers were about 10-fold lower than those detected in the B.1.617.2/Delta pseudotype assay. As expected, SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies were not detected in animals immunized with the B/HPIV3 empty vector. We also evaluated the serum neutralizing antibody titers to HPIV3 in animals from Experiment #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>) and #1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>), showing a strong neutralizing immune response in all groups. The B/HPIV3 empty-vector immunized animals exhibited the strongest anti-vector immune response (Experiment #2: 1.6 and 2.1-fold higher than those induced by B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P, P&lt;0.0001).</p><p id="P15">Finally, we evaluated the ability of serum antibodies from the B/HPIV3/S-2P- and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters to block binding of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to SARS-CoV-2 S proteins of several lineages. This sensitive binding inhibition assay is based on electrochemiluminescence and serves as a high-throughput alternative to BSL3 SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. At a serum dilution of 1:20, antibodies from B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals completely inhibited ACE2 binding to recombinant S proteins derived from the vaccine-matched Wuhan-Hu1 or VoCs B.1.1.7/Alpha and B.1.617.2/Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>), and they also efficiently inhibited ACE2 binding to S proteins of B.1.351/Beta or B.1.640.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) (93.6 to 97.7 median % inhibition). Furthermore, serum antibodies induced by B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P also inhibited ACE2 binding to S proteins of the B.1.1.529/Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages, even though the rate of inhibition was lower (54.1 to 91.1 median % inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).

However, after challenge of the B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P immunized animals with any of these three challenge strains, we found only low or baseline expression of CXCL10, Mx2, or IFN-L, confirming that intranasal immunization with B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P was protective against cytokine or IFN induction after challenge with the vaccine-matched WA1/2020 strain, or representatives of B.1.1.7/Alpha or B.1.351/Beta variants.</p><p id="P19">We also determined SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus titers after challenge with strain WA1/2020 or VoCs (B.1.1.7/Alpha or B.1.351/Beta) in tissue homogenates of NT and lung tissues obtained on days 3 and 5 from 5 animals per group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>).

The high levels of sgE copy numbers confirmed high levels of WA1/2020, B.1.1.7/Alpha or B.1.351/Beta challenge virus replication in the empty-vector immunized groups. In the B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P immunized groups, the levels of genomic RNA was significantly lower on days 3 and 5 after challenge with WA1/2020, B.1.1.7/Alpha or B.1.351/Beta. The levels of subgenomic RNA were also lower or undetectable in the B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P immunized groups. Specifically, following WA1/2020 challenge, low levels of sgE RNA were only detectable in one B/HPIV3/S-2P and two B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals on day 3 after challenge; after B.1.351/Beta challenge, low levels of subgenomic RNA were detectable in 2 animals per group on day 3. After B.1.1.7/Alpha challenge of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals, no sgE RNA was detectable on day 3; by day 5 after challenge, no subgenomic RNA was detectable in any of the SARS-CoV-2 challenge subgroups of B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized animals.

Ideally, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should induce a strong immune response in the upper and lower airways to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication at the entry site of infection, with the ability to prevent disease. Intranasal vector vaccines will be useful to complement injectable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for all age groups due to their ability to induce robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the respiratory tract. The live-attenuated B/HPIV3 vector described in this study has been well-characterized in previous pediatric clinical studies as a pediatric vaccine candidate for intranasal immunization and was safe and immunogenic in infants as young as 2 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that a B/HPIV3 vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the original Wuhan-Hu1 isolate that was stabilized in the prefusion form (B/HPIV3/S-2P) was immunogenic and protective in hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In the present study, we aimed to (i) further improve the immunogenicity of B/HPIV3/S-2P, (ii) evaluate the protection conferred by the S-expressing B/HPIV3 vectors against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 from two heterologous lineages in hamsters, and (iii) evaluate the magnitude and breadth of the antibody response of immunized hamsters following challenge with the homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 isolates.</p><p id="P25">In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], we used the “S-2P” version as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen. This S ORF corresponds to the first available SARS-CoV-2 sequence in which the furin cleavage site “RRAR” was replaced by the “GSAS” motif and two proline substitutions at aa 986 and 987 were introduced to stabilize S into its prefusion form. The resulting B/HPIV3/S-2P was highly immunogenic and protective against a challenge with the homologous SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, a subsequent study showed that four additional proline substitutions at aa position 817, 892, 899 and 942 of S introduced into a soluble prefusion-stabilized version of the S protein (S-6P) significantly increased the level of transient expression of S from plasmids in transfected human cells (six to 10-fold), and increased the physical stability of the S protein without affecting its antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. We hypothesized that the potentially increased expression of S-6P compared to S-2P by the B/HPIV3 vector might increase the S-specific immune response. Even though we were not able to detect a statistically significant increase in expression of S-6P over S-2P by B/HPIV3 in Vero or A549 cells, S-6P seemed to be incorporated into Vero-grown B/HPIV3 particles more efficiently than S-2P. Previously, we found that the incorporation of the RSV fusion (F) protein into B/HPIV3 virions increased the magnitude and quality of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. We speculated that the increased immunogenicity associated with incorporation into the vector particle could be due to more efficient presentation of the heterologous antigen. In the present study, we found in two independent hamster experiments that B/HPIV3/S-6P induced significantly higher serum anti-RBD IgG and IgA antibody titers than B/HPIV3/S-2P, suggesting that B/HPIV3/S-6P was modestly but significantly more immunogenic than B/HPIV3/S-2P. This might be due to the improvements in the structure-based design, resulting in increased physical stability of the S-6P version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and/or the modest increase in incorporation in the B/HPIV3 particles observed in this study.</p><p id="P26">We also evaluated the breadth of neutralization conferred by the B/HPIV3-S-expressing vectors against VoCs. Serum antibodies from B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters efficiently neutralized the homologous SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 isolate as well as VoCs of lineage B.1.1.7/Alpha, B.1.351/Beta or B.1.617.2/Delta. In an ACE2 binding inhibition assay, used as surrogates for BSL3 virus neutralization assays, hamster sera were less efficient in inhibiting ACE2 binding to S derived from B.1.1.529/Omicron sublineages than from WA1/2020 or other VoCs. However, sera from B/HPIV3/S-2P- and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters were still able to substantially inhibit ACE2 binding of S derived from Omicron sublineages. Thus, a single intranasal immunization with the S-expressing B/HPIV3 vectors induced a broad neutralization to antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p id="P27">B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters were protected from weight loss and lung inflammation following homologous or heterologous (B.1.1.7/Alpha and B.1.351/Beta lineages) SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Only low levels of B.1.351/Beta replication were detected in the NT and lung of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters that was cleared by day 5 post-challenge. Our results suggested that a single intranasal immunization with B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P conferred a broad protection in both the upper and lower airways against at least the Alpha and Beta VoCs. Thus, protection induced in the respiratory tract by these vectors seemed to be superior to injectable vaccines such as the adenovirus-based vaccines or alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccines which in the hamster model were less effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus loads in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] or the upper airways of immunized hamsters following challenge with VoCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Three weeks after challenge, B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P-immunized hamsters exhibited anamnestic serum antibody responses with an increased breadth of neutralizing activities against all tested SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including 10 different B.1.1.529/Omicron sublineages. Furthermore, B/HPIV3/S-6P appeared to prime for a stronger anamnestic antibody response than B/HPIV3/S-2P, inducing three-fold higher anamnestic neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Since B/HPIV3/S-6P induced more robust primary serum IgA and IgG responses and primed for stronger and broader anamnestic responses, B/HPIV3/S-6P was further evaluated in rhesus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Based on its broad immunogenicity, and the efficacy against two SARS-CoV-2 variants described here, and based on the strong systemic and mucosal immunogenicity in macaques described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], B/HPIV3/S-6P is currently being advanced to a phase I study as an intranasal live attenuated vaccine against both HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2 for infants and young children.</p><p id="P29">In this study, we evaluated B/HPIV3 as an intranasal vector vaccine candidate expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from an additional gene. B/HPIV3 is attenuated in humans by the N, P, M, and L genes, which are derived from bovine parainfluenza virus type 3. Thus, B/HPIV3 is expected to be safe in HPIV3 seronegative infants and children and suitable as a bivalent vaccine against HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2, but it will likely be over-attenuated in HPIV3 experienced individuals. In the best-case scenario, intranasal immunization of HPIV3-experienced individuals with B/HPIV3 expressing the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S antigen would confer a protective mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 due to the high level of immunogenicity of the prefusion-stabilized S protein, and despite the greatly restricted ability of HPIV3 to replicate in the respiratory tract in presence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity. We are planning to evaluate this in prime-boost studies in animal models. In another limitation, in this study, we characterized the differences in prefusion stabilization of two S antigens derived from the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 isolate, but the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants have evolved to accumulate antigenic differences from the ancestral strain. However, our results show that the breadth of protection and antibody reactivity to antigenically distant variants are substantial. We are currently including S antigens from other variants in our studies to characterize the differences in immune responses and protective efficacy of vaccine-matched vs non-matched antigens in the hamster challenge model.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P30">Human lung epithelial A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) were grown in F-12K medium (ATCC) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

On day 26 post-immunization, sera were collected from the remaining 10 animals per group to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates. HPIV3 vector-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected by a 60% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>60</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] on Vero cells in 24-well plates using HPIV3 expressing the eGFP protein. To determine the serum neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated hamster sera were tested in a microneutralization assay for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the replication of 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Serum IgG antibodies to a secreted form of the S-2P protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] or its RBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] were measured by ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and serum IgA antibodies to the secreted form of S-2P were measured by europium ion-enhanced DELFIA-TRF assay (Perkin Elmer) following the supplier’s protocol.</p><p id="P38">In Experiment #2, groups (n=45) of 5- to 6-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters were immunized intranasally with 5 log<sub>10</sub> PFU of B/HPIV3, B/HPIV3/S-2P, or B/HPIV3/S-6P as described above. Sera were obtained on days 26 or 27. Hamsters in each immunization group were randomly distributed to 3 challenge virus subgroups of 15 animals per subgroup, and challenged intranasally with 4.5 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, the USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020 isolate (lineage B.1.1.7/Alpha variant) or USA/MD-HP01542/2021 (lineage B.1.351/Beta variant) in 100 µl. Five hamsters from each challenge virus subgroup were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation on days 3 and 5 after challenge, and tissues were collected to evaluate challenge virus replication. The presence of challenge virus in clarified tissue homogenates was evaluated later by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay on Vero E6 cells. The remaining 5 hamsters from each challenge virus subgroup were euthanized on day 21 after challenge, and serum was collected for antibody analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Immunohistopathology analysis</title><p id="P39">Lung tissue samples from hamsters were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed through a Leica ASP6025 tissue processor (Leica Biosystems), and embedded in paraffin. Five μm tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histopathology. For IHC evaluation, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After epitope retrieval, sections were labeled with goat hyperimmune serum to anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (N25-154) at 1:1000, and rabbit polyclonal anti-HPIV3 serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] at 1:500. Chromogenic staining was carried out on the Bond RX platform (Leica Biosystems) according to manufacturer-supplied protocols. Detection with DAB chromogen was completed using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems). The VisUCyte anti-goat horseadish peroxidase (HRP) polymer (R&amp;D Systems) replaced the standard Leica anti-rabbit HRP polymer from the kit to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S goat antibodies. Slides were finally cleared through gradient alcohol and xylene washes prior to mounting. Sections were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist using an Olympus BX51 light microscope. Images were acquired using an Olympus DP73 camera.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Lentivirus-based pseudotype virus neutralization assay</title><p id="P40">Single-round luciferase-expressing pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfecting plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 S of isolate B.1.617.2/Delta or B.1.1.529/Omicron, luciferase reporter (pHR’ CMV Luc), lentivirus backbone (pCMV ΔR8.2), and human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) at a ratio of 1:20:20:0.3 into HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC CRL-11268) using transfection reagent LiFect293. Three days post transfection, supernatants were collected and centrifugated at 478 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter.</p><p id="P41">Pseudoviruses were then aliquoted and titrated. For the antibody neutralization assay, 6-point, 5-fold dilution series were prepared in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 % Pen/Strep and 3 µg/ml puromycin. Fifty µl of the diluted sera were mixed with 50 µl of diluted pseudoviruses in 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Then, ten thousand of ACE2-expressing 293T-cells (293T-hACE2.MF stable cell line) per well were added. Three days later, cells were lysed with Bright-Glo™ luciferase assay substrate (Promega), and luciferase activity (relative light units, RLU) was evaluated. The percent neutralization was normalized relative to uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and cells infected with only pseudoviruses as 0% neutralization. Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) titers were determined using a log (agonist) vs. normalized response (variable slope) nonlinear function in Prism v9 (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>ACE2 binding inhibition assay</title><p id="P42">A 10-plex ACE2 binding inhibition assay was performed as an alternative to a BSL3 SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay [SARS-CoV-2 Panel 25 and 27 (K15586U and K15609U, respectively), MesoScale Diagnostics (MSD)], following the manufacturer’s instructions. The panels contain 96-well, 10-spot plates coated with soluble ectodomains of spike proteins from the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu1, identical amino acid sequence as WA1/2020) and VoCs (B.1.1.7/Alpha, B.1.351/Beta, B.1.617.2/Delta, B.1.1.529/Omicron BA.1, BA.1+S[R346K], BA.1+S[L452R], BA.2, BA.2+S[L452M], BA.2+S[L452R], BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5 sublineages) and a variant under monitoring (B.1.640.2). In brief, plates were blocked with MSD blocker A for 30 min and washed with MSD wash buffer. Heat-inactivated hamster sera were diluted 1:20 in diluent and added to duplicate wells. After a one-hour incubation, sulfo-tag labelled ACE2 was added to each well. All incubations were performed on a plate shaker at room temperature. Following a one-hour incubation, plates were washed, MSD GOLD electrochemiluminescence read buffer B was added, and chemiluminescence of bound sulfo-tag-ACE2 was detected using a Meso 1300 Quickplex reader. The average electrochemiluminescence signals in duplicate wells for each serum were determined, as well as the maximum electrochemiluminescence signals of ACE2/S protein binding in no-serum control wells. The ACE2 neutralizing activity of each serum is represented as percent inhibition relative to no-serum controls.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in lung tissue</title><p id="P43">Total RNA was extracted from 0.1 ml of lung homogenates (0.1 g/ml) using the TRIzol LS Reagent and Phasemaker Tubes Complete System (Thermo Fisher) along with the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted in 0.1 ml RNase-free water.

Summary</title></caption><p>SARS-CoV-2 infects and causes disease in all age groups. While injectable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are effective against severe COVID-19, they do not fully prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission. This study describes the preclinical comparison in hamsters of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P, live-attenuated pediatric vector vaccine candidates expressing the “2P” prefusion stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the further-stabilized “6P” version. B/HPIV3/S-6P induced significantly stronger anti-S serum IgA and IgG responses than B/HPIV3/S-2P. A single intranasal immunization with B/HPIV3/S-6P elicited broad systemic antibody responses in hamsters that efficiently neutralized the vaccine-matched isolate as well as variants of concern, including Omicron. B/HPIV3/S-6P immunization induced near-complete airway protection against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 isolate as well as two variants. Furthermore, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, immunized hamsters exhibited strong anamnestic serum antibody responses. Based on these data, B/HPIV3/S-6P will be further evaluated in a phase I study.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>B/HPIV3 vectors expressing prefusion-stabilized versions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein</title><p>(A) Map of the B/HPIV3 genome with the added SARS-CoV-2 S gene. BPIV3 genes are shown in blue, HPIV3 genes encoding the fusion and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase proteins are in red, and the S gene is in orange. Each gene, including the SARS-CoV-2 S gene, begins and ends with PIV3 gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) transcription signals (light and dark grey bars, respectively). The S gene encodes a prefusion-stabilized uncleaved (S-2P) version of the S protein, or a further stabilized version (S-6P) with 6 proline substitutions [6P; [21]], and was inserted into an AscI site between the BPIV3 N and P genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The stabilizing proline substitutions and four aa substitutions that ablate the furin cleavage site (RRAR to GSAS, aa 682-685) in the S-2P and S-6P proteins are indicated. (B) Stability of SARS-CoV-2 expression, analyzed by dual-staining immunoplaque assay. Virus stocks were titrated on Vero cells and analyzed by dual-staining immunoplaque assay essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], using a goat hyperimmune antiserum against a recombinantly-expressed secreted form of S-2P protein and a rabbit hyperimmune antiserum against HPIV3 virions. HPIV3- and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific staining was pseudocolored in red and green, respectively; dual staining appeared as yellow. The percentage (± standard deviation) of yellow plaques is indicated at the bottom. (C, D) Multicycle replication of B/HPIV3 vectors on Vero and human lung epithelial A549 cells. Cells in 6-well plates were infected in triplicate with indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell and incubated at 32°C for a total of 7 days. At 24 h intervals, aliquots of culture medium were collected and flash-frozen for subsequent immunoplaque titration on Vero cells. (E, F, G) Viral proteins in infected cell lysates (E, F) and purified virions (G). Vero (E) or A549 (F) cells in 6-well plates were infected with B/HPIV3, B/HPIV3/S-2P or B/HPIV3/S-6P at an MOI of 1 and incubated at 32°C for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions and Western blotting. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected using the goat hyperimmune serum to S-2P protein, and the BPIV3 N protein was detected by a rabbit hyperimmune serum raised against sucrose-purified HPIV3, followed by immunostaining with infrared fluorophore labeled secondary antibodies and infrared imaging. Immunostaining for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is shown as a loading control. Images were acquired and analyzed using Image Studio software (LiCor) and are representatives of three independent experiments. (G) Vero-grown virus preparations of B/HPIV3, B/HPIV3/S-2P, and B/HPIV3/S-6P were purified by centrifugation through 30/60% sucrose gradients, and gently pelleted by centrifugation to remove sucrose. One µg of protein per lane was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above.
