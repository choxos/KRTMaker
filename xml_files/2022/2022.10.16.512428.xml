Such non-causal firing is contrary to the tenet of spikes as a means of communication, and its origin and purpose remain unclear. Here, we propose that non-input driven firing can serve as a release valve to protect neurons from the toxic conditions arising in mitochondria from lower-than-baseline energy consumption. We built a framework of models that incorporate homeostatic control of metabolic products–ATP, ADP, and reactive oxygen species, among others–by way of changes in firing. Our theory can account for key features of neuronal activity observed in many experiments in studies ranging from ion channels function all the way to resting state dynamics. We propose an integrated, crucial role for metabolic spiking that bridges the gap between metabolic homeostasis and neuronal function. Finally, we make testable predictions to validate or falsify our theory.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Spontaneous Activity</kwd><kwd>Reactive Oxygen Species</kwd><kwd>Mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Ion Channels</kwd><kwd>Spiking Neuronal Network</kwd><kwd>Parkinson’s disease</kwd><kwd>Neurotheory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neurons fire for no apparent reason<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, in sleeping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, resting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and awake animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, in acute slices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Such spontaneous activity is thought to be an integral part of neural function, but its origin remains unexplained. What’s more, conventional wisdom dictates that spikes relay information based on the inputs they receive. Non-causal activity seems at odds with such a model of efficient neural processing. Finally, spikes are costly, as energy is necessary to power them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In this light it is unclear why neurons should fire in the absence of inputs when it would be less noisy and more energy-efficient to remain passive.</p><p id="P3">Energy consumption in neurons, broadly speaking, is the utilisation of ATP for i) restoring ion gradients after synaptic inputs, ii) general maintenance of the cellular machinery, and iii) the generation and transmission of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Input (i) and output (iii) processing costs are substantial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and ATP consumption can fluctuate widely between periods of input silence and intense activity. In order to quickly react to incoming inputs, neurons must near instantaneously match cellular ATP demands with ATP production. Such rapid ATP production in neurons is facilitated by their mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), where the chemical energy from pyruvate is transformed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, or citric acid cycle) and the electron transport chain (ETC) to establish a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane denoted by ΔΨ. When protons re-enter the mitochondrial matrix through the complex V (ATP synthase) of the ETC, ATP is milled from ADP molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This mitochondrial ATP is then exchanged with the cytosolic ADP to be consumed in processes such as Na-K pumps.</p><p id="P4">In all cells, not just neurons, ATP production in mitochondria routinely leads to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) when electrons escape from the ETC. Such rogue electrons cause free radicals which intervene in biochemical pathways and disrupt cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. ROS levels increase with increased number of electrons transiting the ETC in a process known as “Forward Electron Transport” ROS (FETROS) release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This occurs during periods of increased ATP production that matches high ATP demand. Under these circumstances, any established ΔΨ is used to produce ATP, which in turn is rapidly utilised and turned to ADP. FETROS occurs under high ATP demands and coincides with low ΔΨ and low ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, f</xref>, lower left magenta square).</p><p id="P5">Critically, decreased energy demands, i.e., lowered ATP consumption, can also increase ROS release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This occurs when ATP is not consumed at expected rates and mitochondrial ADP becomes scarce at the complex V. Consequently, ATP production nearly stalls and the electrons lingering on the ETC escape to produce so-called “Reverse Electron Transport” ROS (RETROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. RETROS increases with increased ETC stalling and coincides with high ΔΨ and high ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>, upper right green square). Such increased ROS production in case of both increased and decreased ATP production leads to a non-monotonic, V-shaped relationship between ATP consumption and intracellular ROS levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). ROS is toxic for most cellular processes. For example in skin cells, ROS-induced stress leads to cell death. However terminally differentiated post-mitotic cells, i.e., cells that cannot be replaced or replicated such as skeletal muscle cells, are equipped with additional mechanisms to minimise ROS by scavenging the escaped electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. They may even avoid ROS formation altogether by controlling the intake of glucose – the primary 6-carbon chemical energy supply in cells – and tightly regulating its breakdown to pyruvate via glycolysis, or by storing surplus as reserves in the form of glycogen or lipid droplets.</p><p id="P6">Neurons are special. Despite their extensive energy demands, healthy, mature, i.e., terminally differentiated and post-mitotic neurons are not known to maintain long-term energy reserves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, glucose intake and its breakdown via glycolysis are less well regulated in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and continuously augmented by supplements from external sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (For more details on metabolism in neurons see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref> and for metabolic differences between neurons, astrocytes and skeletal muscle cells see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 3.5</xref>). These observations lead us to the central assumption of our work – in neurons, ATP production follows a lean production cycle with the rate limiting step at the last site of the electron transport chain. In other words, the rate of ATP production is controlled by (ΔΨ and) the availability of ADP at ATP synthase (complex V) of the ETC. Functionally, this is sensible because neurons need to retain a high level of metabolic readiness in order to process potentially life-threatening inputs and consequent rapid surges in ATP demands. Keeping the rate-limiting step of ATP production at the complex V can guarantee such readiness. Only a sufficiently high proton gradient and ADP would thus be required to produce ATP. Mechanistically, our assumption is congruent with neurons’ lack of long-chain carbon reserves, their reliance on leaner carbon molecules and on mitochondria for their energy requirements. The brim-full proton gradient that is beneficial to guarantee quick and reliable ATP availability would come at the cost of RETROS-poisoning during periods of synaptic quiescence when ATP production stalls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that under RETROS conditions many ATP consuming processes such as phosphorylation, transport of cellular cargo and cellular upkeep would be enhanced, but given that up to 80% of a neuron’s ATP budget may be allocated to input processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, a more comprehensive solution, in addition to ROS scavenging, seems imperative to avoid acute RETROS build-up. (For a list of ROS relieving mechanisms see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 3.4</xref>)</p><p id="P7">Here, we propose that some experimentally observed “spontaneous” firing is in fact not spontaneous, but serves as a release valve to protect neurons from toxic reactive oxygen species that appear due to ATP-production stalling when energy consumption is low, i.e., when RETROS conditions prevail. Further, we show that such <italic>metabolic spikes</italic> may be behaviourally relevant and we explore the validity and the implications of our theory in 5 increasingly detailed, biologically plausible models. We begin with a mitochondrial model that links the TCA and ATP production with ROS release to show that (I) metabolic spikes, i.e., spikes that serve metabolic homeostasis and save neurons from ROS, could provide the necessary quick increase in ATP expenditure and limit RETROS. Next, (II) we account for the frequency and the firing pattern of metabolic spikes that would be necessary to perform ROS homeostasis and explore potential mechanisms that can detect a neuron’s <italic>metabolic state</italic>, and drive the general changes in intrinsic firing. To showcase a single ion channel type’s response to ROS more concretely, (III) we model the reported intrinsic firing changes in dorsal fan-shaped body neurons due to <italic>β</italic>-subunits of Shaker channel of fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>). Further, we show that metabolic spikes may not just contribute noise, but may be integral for neural function and behaviour. For this, we examine (IV) the consequence of <italic>metabolic spikes</italic> in a large-scale recurrent network model and compare the resulting sustained activity with previous experimental observations. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for a neuro-degenerative disease (V) whose hallmark symptom is altered spontaneous activity, i.e., Parkinson’s. We end our study with a set of experimentally testable predictions (VI) that would prove or falsify our theory.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><p id="P8">In neurons, several cellular processes consume ATP. In our study, we separated all ATP consuming processes into two categories based on how quickly these ATP costs can change. We consider the ATP budget for all input processing and cellular maintenance as a slow-changing, steady-state expense. We refer to this budget as the non-spiking cost or baseline cost and mark it as a star (<italic>✶</italic>) in all figures. At baseline, the ATP-producing mitochondrial processes will match the ATP demands and arrive at steady state values of ATP concentration and ΔΨ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Secondly, we consider the ATP budget that is required to re-balance the Na-K ions, neurotransmitter release and re-uptake after an action potential as a fast transient increase from the baseline costs. We denote this budget as per-spike cost (Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, i</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To visualise the baseline costs and the transient excursions due to a spike, we introduce the ‘respiratory state space’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f, h</xref>) - a two dimensional space spanned by ATP on the x-axis and ΔΨ on the y-axis. Any given neuron will be situated at a specific location in respiratory state space according to its current baseline cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Spikes will produce transient excursions along trajectories that depend on a neuron’s position in the state space and the per-spike cost expense Q. The neuron’s momentary position thus reflects its metabolic state.</p><sec id="S3"><label>I</label><title>Metabolic spikes can quench mitochondrial ROS</title><p id="P10">Periods of low ATP consumption are known to lead to elevated ROS levels in other cell types but they have never been observed in neurons, despite their widely fluctuating energy consumption. We wondered if spike initiation could serve as a homeostatic mechanism that regulates ROS by restoring ATP production when energy consumption is low. To explore this idea more quantitatively, we developed a theoretical framework in which the metabolic state affects neural excitability. We started by expanding an existing mitochondria model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> to include ROS production and its scavenging such that ROS amplitude was a direct consequence of the concentration of mitochondrial ATP (ATP<sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) and the proton gradient ΔΨ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h, j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods 2.1-2.4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">ROS concentrations could thus be regulated by eliciting “metabolic spikes”, prompting excursions from their momentary metabolic state (black star in all figures) in the ‘respiratory state space’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b,c</xref>). These excursions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h, i</xref>) from non-spiking baseline transiently increase cytosolic ATP (ATP<sub><italic>C</italic></sub>) consumption and thus provide mitochondrial ADP (ADP<sub><italic>M</italic></sub>). Depending on a neuron’s position in respiratory state space, additional spikes can decrease or increase ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, black and gold star, respectively) independently of other variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). To minimise FETROS, a neuron may thus have to decrease spiking, and save ATP. To minimise RETROS, a neuron may instead have to produce spikes at various intervals and thus spend ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Because ROS production is non-monotonic with ATP consumption, there exists an ATP expenditure rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ATP</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> between the RETROS and FETROS conditions such that ROS levels are at a minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>II</label><title>The firing patterns a neuron produces will depend on the details of its energy budget</title><p id="P12">In a minimal neuron model that tracks the metabolic costs of basic maintenance, integration, and spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) we can estimate the firing patterns a neuron must elicit to reach a ROS minimum. In a real neuron, the metabolic state could be read out from its ROS levels directly (see below), but also from its ATP/ADP ratio, its intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and the cumulative footprint of its ROS scavenger response with its resulting redox potential. For the simplicity of our model, we considered only two of these variable and calculated a non-ambiguous “metabolic signal” as MS = ROS<italic>×∂</italic>ATP, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∂</mml:mo><mml:mtext>ATP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>ATP-</mml:mtext><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ATP</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In this accounting model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods 2.5</xref>) the necessary spike changes to minimize ROS can be obtained by introducing two thresholds, <italic>θ<sub>RET</sub></italic> and <italic>θ<sub>F</sub>ET</italic>. When MS is large (high ROS, high mitochondrial ATP<sub><italic>M</italic></sub>), such that MS<italic>&gt; θ<sub>RET</sub></italic>, the model elicits ATP-consuming, RETROS-quenching metabolic spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). If MS decreases, such that <italic>θ<sub>RET</sub> &gt;</italic>MS<italic>&gt; θ<sub>F</sub>ET</italic>, metabolic spiking ceases. When MS decreases further (depleted mitochondrial ATP<sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, high ROS), such that MS<italic>&lt; θ<sub>F ET</sub></italic>, even input-driven, synaptic spiking is prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In our model, intrinsic excitability is thus governed by MS and serves as a homeostatic mechanism to minimize ROS.</p><p id="P14">The effectiveness of a spike to modulate ROS depends on a number of variables, most prominently the transient increase in ATP consumption after each spike, i.e., per-spike-cost (Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). When the per-spike-cost Q is sufficiently high, single spikes delivered at low rates suffice to quench RETROS. For lower Q, several spikes are necessary to decrease the MS and quench high ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Q also affects the FETROS response, as expensive spikes will deplete cellular ATP more and lead to prolonged periods of blocked spike initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The various possible combinations of Q and steady-state ATP consumption can account for many different spike different spike patterns, ranging from silent to regular firing to bursting, to continuously active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). In mature neurons, Q would presumably be constant, but the steady state non-spiking expense (star in all figures) may change, e.g., due to changes in input activity, a neuron’s size or its history (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref> for additional relevant variables). The firing patterns that emerge from these combinations of constraints can range from an occasional single spike to bursting or even continuous spiking and mirror many of the experimentally observed intrinsic activity patterns (Discussion).</p><p id="P15">Any energy homeostatic mechanism must be sensitive to the current metabolic state of the neuron. We propose that, excitability of the neuron must dynamically change in response to the metabolic status, and provide relief from both FETROS and RETROS. A candidate mechanisms to achieve such a swift modulation in excitability would likely involve the many ion channel types that can sense the metabolic state via metabolic signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We can broadly categorise such metabolic state-sensing ion channels as ATP ‘savers’ and ‘spenders’ in a simplified neuron model (Methods).</p><p id="P16">ATP savers aim to silence neurons when FETROS conditions prevail. Their combined action delays spikes or suppress them entirely. ATP saver channels act to hyperpolarize the membrane potential such as ATP-sensitive or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive potassium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> top). On the other hand, ATP spenders should facilitate spiking, e.g., through channels that aid rapid re-polarisation and decrease spike-frequency adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> bottom) or by low-threshold-activating depolarising channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Similarly, channels that would increase bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), or shorten the refractory period and thus effectively eliminate interspike intervals would promote ATP spending and support the firing patterns required to maintain a baseline level of ATP expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> light purple, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Cumulative changes in many ion channels, such as changes in voltage sensitivity, activation or inactivation profiles, time constants and conductivity, and several other post-translational modifications in response to the metabolic state, will determine if a neuron decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-e</xref>, upper panels), or increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-e</xref>, lower panels) its excitability (Discussion). Importantly, the down-regulation of ATP savers during RETOS could effectively permit ATP expenditure, and vice versa. As such, the designation of an ion channel as an ATP saver or spender would not be based on the specific ion they gate, but on the cumulative change in the firing property of the neuron. Notably, we can identify more than 15 candidate pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 3.2</xref>) that target ion channels which could counter RETROS or FETROS conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>III</label><title>Linking ion channel function with metabolic state and ROS</title><p id="P18">One example of using spikes to sustain the ETC has been observed in dorsal fan-shaped body (dfb) neurons of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>). In these sleep-switching dfb neurons, the A-type “Shaker” potassium channels’ <italic>β</italic>-subunits called “Hyperkinetic” are modulated by a key molecule involved in ROS scavenging called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>). When ROS is high, NADPH is converted into NADP+, neutralising ROS, but also eliminating the channels’ inactivation mechanism. The fast-activating, fast-inactivating Shaker-Hyperkinetic channel thus changes to slow-inactivating during RETROS states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c</xref>). This loss of the inactivation gate of a K<sup>+</sup> channel is thought to be the cause for a behaviourally relevant increase in firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4f</xref>, top).</p><p id="P19">We can support this assumption and reproduce ROS-dependent firing changes in a standard Hodgkin-Huxley type model with an additional A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel, resembling Shaker-Hyperkinetic channel, that alters its inactivation properties in response to ROS. In our model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods 2.6</xref>), slowed inactivation of the A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel leads to increased participation of its currents in membrane re-polarisation, out-competing slower-activating, non-A-type currents and thus allowing for more rapid re-polarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4f</xref>, bottom) and consequently decreased inter-spike intervals (and thus an increase in firing) as consistent with experimental observations.</p><p id="P20">In the experiment this can be directly linked to ROS because, when the fruit fly is sleep deprived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> green star), the dfb neurons are pushed beyond their physiological operational preparedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d</xref> grey background). In our framework this can be interpreted as a situation in which metabolic homeostasis through spiking becomes insufficient and the additional RETROS burden is revealed. In the experiment, a higher ROS burden can also be delivered optogenetically through mini Singlet Oxygen Generators (miniSOG) and can this be simulated congruently by an upward shift in the relationship between baseline ATP consumption and ROS concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref> blue). Conversely, a ROS decrease can be achieved experimentally by Alternative Oxidase (AOX), providing an additional exit for electrons from the ETC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref> red). In the model this can be simulated accordingly by a downward shift in the relationship between baseline ATP consumption and ROS concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We wondered if such consistency between model and experiment could also be observed in other neural systems.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>IV</label><title>Metabolic spikes in a recurrent neural network model</title><p id="P21">To explore the effects of spike-induced energy homeostasis in neural circuits, we built a network model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> of 8,000 excitatory and 2,000 inhibitory conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We used previously published neuron and network parameters, such that each neuron received recurrent inputs from a random 2% of the network as well as from external Poisson inputs. Additionally, each neuron is subject to a metabolic current <italic>I<sub>M</sub></italic> that was controlled by a metabolic state variable MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods 2.7</xref>) tracking the metabolic costs of synaptic inputs and action potentials. MS controlled the metabolic current <italic>I<sub>M</sub></italic> such that high MS produced depolarising membrane currents, and low MS lead to hyperpolarising currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5b</xref>). When the network receives external stimuli, it initially fired at high rates and thus utilised large amounts of ATP, consequently operating in the FETROS regime with very low MS values. As a result, the MS-induced metabolic current becomes hyperpolarizing, contributing to a stable balance of excitation and inhibition and lowering firing rates to prevent seizure-like states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c-f</xref>, left). Such dampened activity shifts the metabolic load near the ROS minimum. When external inputs are turned off, recurrent synaptic activity alone cannot self-sustain indefinitely, and network activity collapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c, d</xref>, end of yellow bar). Due to the lack of synaptic input, and subsequent decrease of ATP consumption, the MS controlled current becomes depolarising, eventually causing metabolic spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c-f</xref>, middle). These first few spikes in the network rapidly activate their similarly depolarised downstream neighbours, and eventually activate the entire network, preventing RETROS build-up via synaptic currents and spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c-f</xref>, right). Depending on various variables such as per-spike cost, as well as the structure of the network, activity may briefly cease again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c-f</xref>, right), before experiencing the next RETROS induced <italic>avalanche</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Such avalanches are indistinguishable from externally driven activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5g-i</xref>), except for their internal metabolic status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5j</xref>).

To quickly process multiple signals from external sources (such as graded potentials or peptidergic inputs) neurons may have evolved towards an on-demand ATP production strategy, utilising a lean ATP production cycle with minimal carbon reserve inventory and an increased dependence on ATP-efficient mitochondria. As such, the baseline energy requirements of the cell could be rapidly met by maintaining a healthy mitochondrion population, and additional ATP can be quickly synthesised when needed. The only caveat of this arrangement is that when ATP usage drops below baseline, cells must be able to deal with imminently changing RETROS conditions. Since any upstream compensation (such as e.g., changing the numbers of mitochondria) would happen at slow timescales, only a transient and immediate increase in ATP consumption could avoid RETROS poisoning. Increasing ATP usage by increasing hyperpolarising leak currents is impractical as it would render the cell unresponsive. Instead, producing a fast and reversible depolarisation to shed ATP, possibly at a specialised (axon initial segment-like) site may have been the preferred strategy. Synaptic integration could well have co-opted this mechanism to transmit outputs as digital signals with better reach, providing the evolutionary advantage of rapidly processing multidimensional spatio-temporal inputs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P59">In conclusion, metabolic regulation of neural excitability may present a crucial puzzle piece to contextualise the neuronal dynamics that form the basis of all behavior and may have large implications for the evolution of the neural code. If true, metabolic spikes add to the many riches mitochondria bestow upon us.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS155879-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d132aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. C.

Second, increases in per-spike-cost Q may arise from loss of myelin (blue boxes), poor synaptic vesicle loading and release and re-uptake of dopamine (blue arrows). Third, increased overall baseline costs, e.g., due to inefficient endosome formation or poor lysosomal function, results in a general shift of non-spiking baseline costs towards FETROS (denoted with gold arrows). In all the above cases, decrease in metabolic spiking and hence diminished extracellular dopamine (black crosses), may lead to a compensatory up-regulated dopamine production, by way of the D2-autoreceptor, that may contribute to deleterious DOPAL in the cytosol. <bold>c)</bold> The neurons’ presumed physiological range is indicated by the white background.

Neurons (grey box) rely mostly on glucose under FETROS (left pink arrow) and lactate during RETROS and FETROS (right green+pink arrow) for their pruvate supply. Pyruvate is processed in the neuronal mitochondria (peach box) in their tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and subsequently in the electron transport chain (ETC) to produce ATP and H<sub>2</sub>O by consuming ADP and O<sub>2</sub>. Other metabolites such as ketone bodies from blood directly enter TCA via Acetyl-CoA and circumvent pyruvate. While maintaining ample ATP in the pipette, <bold>e)</bold> blocking the numbered pathways (1,2) in neurons that can limit RETROS conditions may lead to a decrease in the spontaneous firing rates (blue). Conversely, blocking pathways (3-5) that would simultaneously increase the ETC stalling and ΔΨ can cause membrane potential depolarization or an increase in the firing rates (yellow).
