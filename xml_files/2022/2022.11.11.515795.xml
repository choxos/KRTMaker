It enhances the positive selection of CD5+ immature B cells early in life through amplifying the CD19/PI3K/c-MYC pathway and is sufficient to reinitiate self-reactive B-1a cell output when ectopically expressed in the adult. In this study, interactome analysis in primary B cell precursors showed direct binding by LIN28B to numerous ribosomal protein transcripts, consistent with a regulatory role in cellular protein synthesis. Induction of LIN28B expression in the adult setting is sufficient to promote enhanced protein synthesis during the small Pre-B and immature B cell stages, but not during the Pro-B cell stage. This stage dependent effect was dictated by IL-7 mediated signaling, which masked the impact of LIN28B through an overpowering stimulation on the c-MYC / protein synthesis axis in Pro-B cells. Importantly, elevated protein synthesis was a distinguishing feature between neonatal and adult B cell development that was critically supported by endogenous <italic>Lin28b</italic> expression early in life. Finally, we used a ribosomal hypomorphic mouse model to demonstrate that subdued protein synthesis is specifically detrimental for neonatal B lymphopoiesis and the output of B-1a cells, without affecting B cell development in the adult. Taken together, we identify elevated protein synthesis as a defining requirement for early-life B cell development that critically depends on <italic>Lin28b</italic>. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into the layered formation of the complex adult B cell repertoire.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>LIN28B</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>B-1 cells</kwd><kwd>neonatal B cell development</kwd><kwd>c-MYC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">B-cell development is centered around alternating stages of cellular proliferation and V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci, with the goal of producing a diverse yet self-tolerant B cell repertoire. During the Pro-B cell stage, productive IgH rearrangement results in the expression of a pre-BCR complex and differentiation into the large Pre-B cell stage. The latter is marked by a transient burst of clonal expansion. Cell cycle exit is accompanied by the initiation of light chain recombination and entry into the small Pre-B cell stage. IL-7 signaling is an essential trophic factor during the Pro- and large Pre-B cell stages, promoting cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, through distinct effects mediated by the Stat5 and mTORC1/c-MYC signaling axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). IL-7 signaling wanes as large Pre-B cells move away from IL-7 producing stromal cells in vivo and its attenuation is required for the developmental progression into the small Pre-B cell stage and the onset of IgK light chain recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Generation of a productive immunoglobulin heavy and light chain complex leads to membrane IgM expression and developmental progression into the immature B (Imm-B) cell stage. Here, cells carrying innocuous BCRs are allowed to mature while self-reactive specificities are subject to central tolerance mechanisms including receptor editing and apoptosis to remove potentially harmful recognition of “self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Progression through these stages is accompanied by dramatic fluctuations in bioenergetic states. Although metabolic capacity has been proposed to modulate the central tolerance checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), this theory has not been empirically proven.</p><p id="P3">Much of what we know about B cell development comes from studies in adult mice, which differs significantly from fetal and neonatal life. For example, while B cell development in adult bone marrow strictly requires IL-7 mediated signaling, B cell output can take place in neonatal mice lacking IL-7Ra until around two weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Furthermore, both the pre-BCR and mature BCR checkpoints are less stringent during neonatal life allowing for the positive selection of poly and self-reactive specificities in mice and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This correlates with the output of self-reactive CD5+ B-1a cells in mice, which secrete natural antibodies important for the clearance of cellular debris and act as a first line of defense against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Despite these differences, the basis for the developmental switch in B cell output is not well understood.</p><p id="P4">One molecular program that distinguishes early life lymphopoiesis is centered around the post-transcriptional regulator LIN28B. Along with LIN28A, it is one of two mammalian homologs of the heterochronic <italic>lin-28</italic> RNA binding protein first identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In the mammalian hematopoietic system, <italic>Lin28b</italic> expression is abundant during fetal life and gradually silenced within the first two to three weeks of life, critically controlling a neonatal switch in hematopoietic stem cell function and lineage output patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). LIN28A/B plays an established role in regulating cellular growth and metabolism in various tissues, most famously through the direct inhibition of the biogenesis of the evolutionarily conserved Let-7 family of microRNAs. Its expression de-represses Let-7 targets which include the proto-oncogenes <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Arid3a</italic>, <italic>Hmga2</italic> and <italic>Igf2bp1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We and others have previously shown that ectopic LIN28A/B expression in the adult is sufficient to reinitiate a fetal-like gene expression signature and promote key aspects of fetal-like lymphopoiesis, including the efficient production of CD5+ B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). These studies establish ectopic LIN28B expression as a powerful approach to understand the unique molecular program that governs early life B cell output. Furthermore, studies from both BCR poly-clonal and BCR transgenic mouse models make clear that LIN28B relaxes the central tolerance checkpoint to allow for the positive selection of self-reactive BCR specificities and thereby uniquely shapes the neonatal B cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Immunophenotypically, this phenomenon is marked by the developmental progression of CD5+ Imm-B cells destined for the B-1a cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The mechanism for this effect is, although not fully understood, at least in part linked to augmentation of c-MYC protein levels in Imm-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) known to promote B cell positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A less understood mechanism of LIN28B action is through the direct binding of coding mRNAs to either positively or negatively regulate transcript stability and protein translation, in a context dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). In particular, several studies have demonstrated the ability of LIN28B to promote the translation of ribosomal proteins, through Let-7 independent direct binding to their transcripts in human ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), transformed human kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) cell lines. However, the role of the protein synthesis pathway in LIN28B dependent B cell output is not known. Here we demonstrate that LIN28B can directly interact with ribosomal protein transcripts in primary B cell precursors. Using an inducible mouse model we show that LIN28B expression during adult B cell development elevates protein synthesis during the small Pre-B and Imm-B cell stages. Finally, we show that elevated protein synthesis is a hallmark of neonatal B cell development that depends on endogenous <italic>Lin28b</italic> expression and critically supports the generation of CD5+ B-1a cells early in life. We conclude that LIN28B augments protein synthesis to potentiate the unique features of early life B cell output.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P6">tet-LIN28B mice were generated by intercrossing <italic>Col1a<sup>tetO-LIN28B</sup></italic> (JAX: #023911) mice, carrying Doxycyclin (Dox) inducible Flag-tagged human <italic>Lin28b</italic> cDNA under the endogenous <italic>Col1a</italic> promoter, to <italic>Rosa26<sup>rtTA*m2</sup></italic> (JAX: #006965) mice and were originally obtained from the laboratory of George Daley (Harvard Medical School) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).

To better understand the underlying mechanism, we performed immunoprecipitation of its mRNA interactome in developing B cells. To obtain sufficient cell numbers for interactome profiling, adult B cell precursors from uninduced tet-LIN28B and control mice were expanded for 5 days by culturing whole bone marrow cells in the presence of IL-7 and supplemented with Dox <italic>ex vivo</italic> to induce LIN28B expression. After five days with IL-7, the cultures reached above 80% B cell purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental figure 1A</xref>). Cells were harvested and subjected to anti-FLAG RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with poly-A selected RNA-sequencing (RIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunoprecipitation efficiency of LIN28B was validated by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental figure 1B</xref>). Total RNA sequencing of corresponding input samples was used for calculating RIP-seq enrichment. LIN28B RIP/input ratio of the technical replicates showed a high degree of correlation (R=0.93, p &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and were averaged for downstream analyses. 238 transcripts displayed a higher than two-fold RIP/input enrichment in tet-LIN28B samples but showed no trend in the control (Supplemental Table S2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed a prominent enrichment for ribosomal protein coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), suggesting that ribosomal function might be a core target pathway of LIN28B during B cell development. Interestingly, similar observations were previously made in other cell types, including 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Indeed, cross comparison of our identified targets with these studies yielded cytoplasmatic translation as the predominant overlapping GO term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-G</xref>). Our analysis also identified other GO terms involved in RNA splicing and oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with previous LIN28A/B interactome studies in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We conclude that the direct LIN28B mRNA regulon in the context of primary bone marrow B cell progenitor cells is dominated by transcripts implicated in universal biosynthetic pathways, which are shared across a wide range of cell types. In particular, our findings implicate the ribosome as a potential target for LIN28B regulation in B cell progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>LIN28B enhances protein synthesis in the small Pre-B and Imm-B stages of B cell development</title><p id="P22">LIN28B bound mRNA targets have been linked to both translational increase and decrease in a context dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). In the case of ribosomal protein transcripts, enhanced protein translation was shown by SILAC (stable isotope labeling using amino acid in cell culture) metabolic labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) as well as polysome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). To assess ribosomal protein levels during B cell development, we performed western blot analysis on sorted B cell precursors from tet-LIN28B and control mice following 10 days of Dox induction <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental figure 2A</xref>). We selected RPL36, RPL23 and RPS9 from the RIP-seq enriched transcript list and found increased protein expression upon LIN28B induction in the Pro-B and large Pre-B subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Differences were less apparent for the small Pre-B and Imm-B subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental figure 2B</xref>), which have lower cellular protein content. Overall, these results are consistent with enhanced translation of LIN28B bound ribosomal protein encoding transcripts.</p><p id="P23">Given this increase in ribosomal proteins, we expected a corresponding increase in overall ribosomal content upon tet-LIN28B induction. To this end, we measured the 18S rRNAs by qRT-PCR of FACS sorted B cell precursors. To our surprise, Pro and large-Pre-B cells did not exhibit any LIN28B dependent increase in 18S levels. Instead, ribosomal content first began to increase in a LIN28B dependent manner in the quiescent small Pre-B cell stage and reached statistical significance in Imm-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additional analysis of the 45S precursor rRNA showed the same trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, an increase in ribosome biogenesis takes place subsequent to the observed increase in ribosomal protein expression during LIN28B induced B cell development. To evaluate whether this observation correlated with changes in global protein synthesis rates, we measured newly synthesized proteins in freshly isolated B cell precursors using metabolic labelling with the methionine analog L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). As expected, FACS readout of AHA uptake from Dox induced control and tet-LIN28B mice showed highly dynamic protein synthesis levels during B cell development that peaks in the large Pre-B cell subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Pro-B cells exhibited a bimodal profile with respect to protein synthesis that correlated with cell size (AHA<sup>high</sup> or AHA<sup>low</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental figure 2C</xref>). Although there was a tendency towards an increased frequency of AHA<sup>high</sup> Pro-B cell in tet-LIN28B induced mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental figure 2C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">D</xref>), the changes were not statistically significant. Increased global protein synthesis was observed in tet-LIN28B induced small Pre-B and Imm-B cell stages, thereby mirroring the observed effects on ribosome biogenesis. This was accompanied by increased cell size as measured by FACS (FSC-A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), and a moderate increase in the fraction of proliferating cells within the Imm-B subset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental figure 2E</xref>). These findings are consistent with elevated protein synthesis boosting biomass accumulation and cell cycle entry during the later stages of B cell development. Interestingly, analysis of mature B cells showed that protein synthesis in peritoneal cavity B-1 and B-2 cells were not affected by ectopic LIN28B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that LIN28B enhances ribosome content and global protein synthesis levels specifically during the later stages of bone marrow B cell development.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Lin28B augments protein synthesis during IL-7 independent B cell maturation</title><p id="P24">We sought to understand the stage dependent effects of LIN28B expression on protein synthesis by considering the signals that control dynamic changes in cellular metabolism and biosynthesis during B cell development. We have previously shown that Lin28B enhances the output of CD5+ Imm-B cells, and that CD5 levels correspond to BCR self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To assess whether enhanced protein synthesis in Imm-B cells is linked to higher signaling levels through the newly selected BCR we compared CD5 expression with AHA uptake by tet-LIN28B induced Imm-B cells. Indeed, we observed a positive correlation between the two readouts suggesting that enhanced protein synthesis is dictated by BCR signaling strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). To strengthen this interpretation, we confirmed that CD5+ Imm-B cells correspond to those with the highest level of Nurr77-GFP reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), a well-established measurement of antigen receptor stimulation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Interestingly, Nur77-GFP was not altered in small Pre-B cells upon tet-LIN28B induction despite a ~10% increase in protein synthesis at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, our data show that LIN28B induced protein synthesis precedes the positive selection of CD5+ Imm-B cells and is in line with its permissive effect on the developmental progression from the small Pre-B to the Imm-B stages.</p><p id="P25">The lack of LIN28B induced effects on protein synthesis in Pro-B cells was puzzling given the <italic>Lin28b</italic> dependent increase in ribosomal protein expression at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Considering that both IL-7 and LIN28B can act through elevating c-MYC expression, and that the c-MYC transcriptional program is a critical driver of cellular protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), we hypothesized that potent IL-7 signaling might mask any LIN28B mediated effects on the c-MYC / protein synthesis axis in Pro-B cells. To test this, we assessed LIN28B induced protein synthesis in Pro-B cells following IL-7 withdrawal <italic>ex vivo</italic>. B cell precursors were expanded from control and tet-LIN28B adult bone marrow under saturating IL-7 conditions for five days, before culturing under limiting doses of IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Two days following IL-7 withdrawal, cells were harvested and FACS analyzed for LIN28B-dependent effects on c-MYC expression and global protein synthesis. Interestingly, although overall c-MYC and protein synthesis levels of Pro-B cells decreased upon IL-7 withdrawal, the decrease was partially alleviated by tet-LIN28B induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref> left). A similar trend was observed for protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref> right) at limiting IL-7 concentrations. Thus, LIN28B has the capacity to enhance the c-MYC / protein synthesis axis in Pro-B cells, but only under limiting IL-7 availability. Taken together, our results provide a likely explanation to the stage dependent effects of LIN28B expression on protein synthesis during B cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). In Imm-B cells, enhanced protein synthesis is linked to the increased signaling strength of BCR specificities licensed by LIN28B expression. Prior to the Imm-B cell stage, effects on protein synthesis are uncoupled from the BCR, but is dictated by IL-7 responsiveness. During the Pro-B cell stage, potent IL-7 mediated protein synthesis masks the milder effects by LIN28B which only become visible upon entry into the small Pre-B cell stage whereby IL-7Ra expression is fully silenced. This scenario is supported by RNAseq data from sorted B cell precursor subsets from tet-LIN28B and control adult bone marrow, which showed a LIN28B induced increase in c-MYC target genes specifically upon entry into the small Pre-B cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest a critical role for LIN28B in the small Pre-B cell stage as cells loose IL-7 responsiveness and point toward a key role for c-MYC in LIN28B induced protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Elevated protein synthesis is a hallmark of neonatal B cell development</title><p id="P26">Endogenous LIN28B expression is developmentally restricted. FACS analysis of LIN28B-eGFP reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) captured its window of expression as eGFP gradually diminished to background levels after postnatal day 10 in B cell precursors and postnatal day 19 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This time-window correlates with the output of B-1a cells which ceases between day 10 and day 19 during unperturbed hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). During the same window, protein synthesis in neonatal bone marrow small Pre-B and Imm-B cells was elevated compared to the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was dependent on endogenous <italic>Lin28b</italic>, as 3-day-old KO neonates had a significantly lower rate of protein synthesis and decreased cell size during the small Pre-B and Imm-B cell stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). These defects were primarily qualitative and not accompanied by changes in subset frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).

This model carries a mutation that disrupts <italic>Rpl24</italic> mRNA splicing and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). The resulting defect in ribosome biogenesis causes a moderate reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis which has no apparent impact on normal adult B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), but can diminish Eμ-MYC driven B lymphomagenesis known to be ‘addicted’ to heightened ribosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Neonatal B cell development has not previously been examined in <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> mice. Given our findings of higher protein synthesis rates, we hypothesized that neonatal B cell development would be more sensitive to constraints in protein synthesis capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Indeed, analysis of <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> bone marrow revealed a decrease in the overall CD19+ B cell frequency on postnatal day 3 and day 10 that was resolved by day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This translated into a concomitant decrease in the frequency of B cell precursor subsets in the bone marrow of <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and a time-limited decrease in the frequency of mature B cells in both the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) and the peritoneal cavity of neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, neonatal B cell development is more sensitive to constrained protein synthesis with signs of ribosome ‘addiction’. To verify that these effects are cell intrinsic during B cell development, we performed competitive transplantations of neonatal <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> or littermate bone marrow HSPCs into lethally irradiated congenic recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Analysis of donor versus competitor reconstitution of recipient PerC B cells at 14 weeks post-transplantation showed a selective decrease in B-1a cells from <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> donors. In contrast, contribution to the B-2 compartment, which relies on continuous HSPC dependent influx, was comparable between the <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> and wildtype donor HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that neonatal B cell output is selectively sensitive to reduced protein synthesis in a cell intrinsic manner.</p><p id="P28">The B-1a cell subset is enriched for the VH11 and VH12 encoded reactivity against the self-membrane component phosphatidyl choline (PtC) known to originate early in life.

We therefore conclude that elevated protein synthesis is a central distinguishing parameter of neonatal B lymphopoiesis that potentiates the output of CD5+ B-1a cells carrying self-reactive BCRs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">In this study, we identified a role for cellular protein synthesis in regulating the unique aspects of early-life B cell development including the time restricted output of self-reactive B-1a cells. Elevated protein synthesis was a defining feature of neonatal B cell development that was mediated at least in part by the endogenous expression of the heterochronic RNA-binding protein LIN28B. As the expression of LIN28B naturally waned during the first weeks of life, protein synthesis became reduced, and ectopic LIN28B expression in the adult was sufficient to recapitulate elevated protein synthesis small Pre- and Imm-B cells. Consistent with previous reports in other cell types, we showed that LIN28B directly bound to ribosomal protein transcripts in primary B cell precursors, correlating with their enhanced protein expression. Furthermore, an increase in ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis coincided with LIN28B induced c-MYC expression in the quiescent small Pre- and Imm-B cell stages. Finally, using <italic>Rpl24<sup>WT/Bst</sup></italic> mice as a model for constrained protein synthesis capacity, we showed that neonatal B cell development relied on heightened protein synthesis levels – a hallmark of elevated c-MYC activity. The precise extent and mechanism by which LIN28B cooperates with c-MYC to promote cellular protein synthesis was not disentangled in this study. One likely possibility is that LIN28B may post-transcriptionally act on a c-MYC induced transcriptome to facilitate downstream translation, biomass accumulation and B cell developmental progression.</p><p id="P30">Protein synthesis is the most energy consuming biosynthetic process in the cell and subject to the constraints imposed by hundreds of components required for ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Indeed, protein synthesis rates give an accurate account of the overall cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). And yet, its ability to control the development and function of immune cells that require rapid expansion and contraction of cellular growth has been an under-explored subject of investigation. Our results using AHA metabolic labelling to measure protein synthesis confirmed dynamic changes in cellular metabolism that underly proliferative bursts following successful BCR checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrated the ability of LIN28B to partially alleviate the biggest drop in protein synthesis upon entry into the small Pre-B cell stage. The restricted metabolism of small Pre-B cells was previously implicated as a mechanism to safeguard the central tolerance checkpoint through enforcing nutrient stress and negative selection upon strong BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This notion is highly compatible with our observation that LIN28B promoted protein synthesis to augment the output of self-reactive CD5+ B-1 cells early in life. The latter is a hallmark of early life B lymphopoiesis and offers an attractive explanation to the long-known prevalence of self-reactive specificities in neonatal mice and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Thus, we propose that the relatively mild increase in protein synthesis mediated by LIN28B provides sufficient relaxation of the metabolic constraints during B cell maturation to qualitatively alter the B cell output.</p><p id="P31">In Pro-B cells, IL-7 signaling and downstream mTORC1 activation is the principal driver of c-MYC expression and acts to promote biomass accumulation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In this study, we showed that both IL-7 signaling and LIN28B expression act on the c-MYC / protein synthesis axis to promote developmental progression during B cell development and that the powerful effects of IL-7 renders LIN28B function redundant in Pro-B cells. This finding is relevant in the context of understanding the ontogenic differences in IL-7 dependency during B lymphopoiesis. It well-established that the strict requirement for IL-7 mediated signaling, which is characteristic of adult murine B lymphopoiesis, does not apply during fetal and neonatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that LIN28B over-expression during adult hematopoiesis is sufficient to phenocopy fetal-like behavior by circumventing strict IL-7 dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Here, our findings that LIN28B partially cushions the impact of IL-7 withdrawal through promoting the shared downstream c-MYC / protein synthesis axis may offer an explanation to the lessened reliance on IL-7 during early life B lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P32">The RIP-seq experiment presented in this study led us to identify changes in protein synthesis levels as a distinguishing parameter between neonatal and adult B cell development. However, the experiment has several limitations. First, the LIN28B interactome in IL-7 expanded bone marrow Pro-B cell cultures may not exactly reflect that in primary small Pre-B cells. Unfortunately, the amount of material needed for RIPseq is not feasible to obtain from quiescent small Pre-B cells, and data extrapolation should be made with caution. Second, the low number of biological replicates of this experiment prevents statistical analysis and limits the number of enriched transcripts identified. Nevertheless, since our data did detect the same top gene ontology terms as previous datasets from other tissues, they serve as confirmatory evidence in the context of B cell precursors. A recent LIN28B interactome study in hematopoietic progenitors expressing the oncogenic fusion protein MLL-ENL identified both Rps9 and Rpl23 transcripts as direct targets of LIN28B, offering further support to our findings in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Despite these limitations, our approach resulted in the identification of a relevant regulatory axis for early-life B lymphopoiesis. In the context of neonatal immunity, we and others have previously demonstrated that neonatal antigen exposure produces unique B cell memory clones not generated by adult mice immunized with the same antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Our current findings that enhanced protein synthesis quantitatively and qualitatively alters neonatal B cell output implicates ribosomal control in the formation of a unique pre-immune repertoire in neonatal mice and has important implications for the layered formation of a complex adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157081-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d234aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS157081-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d234aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS157081-supplement-Supplementary_Table.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d234aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jonas Ungerbäck and Johanna Tingvall-Gustafsson for help with bioinformatics.
