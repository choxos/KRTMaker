A number of calpain inhibitors show excellent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the viral main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), which plays an essential role in processing viral polyproteins. In this study, we found that calpain inhibitors potently inhibited the infection of a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but not M<sup>pro</sup>. In contrast, calpain inhibitors did not exhibit antiviral activities towards the wild-type VSV with its native glycoprotein. Genetic knockout of calpain-2 by CRISPR/Cas9 conferred resistance of the host cells to the chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virus and a clinical isolate of wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, calpain-2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell attachment by positively regulating the cell surface levels of ACE2. These results highlight an M<sup>pro</sup>-independent pathway targeted by calpain inhibitors for efficient viral inhibition. We also identify calpain-2 as a novel host factor and a potential therapeutic target responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the entry step.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">High mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 pose great challenges for antiviral drug development and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thus far, most antiviral strategies have directly targeted key viral factors involved in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Remdesivir (Gilead) and molnupiravir (Merck) represent two FDA authorized antiviral drugs that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In addition to RdRp, the viral main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) has been a drug target of great interest due to its fundamental role in processing the viral polyproteins. In a series of studies, M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, including Paxlovid (Pfizer), boceprevir, GC376, and various calpain inhibitors, were reported to potently supress SARS-CoV-2 replication in different cell types and in pre-clinical animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In a recent study from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], we performed a drug repurposing screen and identified several compounds that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such compound is MG132, a commonly used 26S proteasome inhibitor. MG132 was previously reported to impair SARS-CoV replication by inhibiting the host cysteine protease m-calpain, also known as calpain-2 (encoded by <italic>CAPN2</italic>), thus functioning through a proteosome-independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Several pieces of evidence led us to hypothesize that host calpain proteases may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, MG132 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, while ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 inhibitor PRY-41 and two other proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and lactacystin did not. Second, E-64, which inhibits endosomal cathepsins, papain, and calpain, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 more robustly than chloroquine, which only targets cathepsins and not calpain. Third, calpain inhibitor II and calpeptin suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], although the mechanism was postulated to be mediated by interfering with activities of M<sup>pro</sup>.</p><p id="P4">Of note, in our follow-up studies described here, we found that MG132 also exhibited antiviral activities against a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], but not expressing M<sup>pro</sup>. The lack of inhibition against wild-type (WT) VSV led us to hypothesize that (1) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may be an additional viral target of calpain and protease inhibitors; and (2) calpain proteins themselves may be crucial host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we confirm these hypotheses and identify CAPN2 as a novel pro-viral host factor that aids in the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that the absence of <italic>CAPN2</italic> reduces viral binding to host cells and RNA production during early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. The findings provide mechanistic insights into the cellular process of SARS-CoV-2 entry and offer an additional explanation to the mechanism of action of calpain inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MG132 preferentially inhibits the infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 but not VSV</title><p id="P5">In a recent antiviral compound screen that we conducted using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen reporter virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], multiple compounds efficaciously inhibited viral infection in Vero E6 cells. We validated 18 of the top hits using recombinant VSV eGFP reporter viruses that either encode the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the native VSV-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Among the 18 compounds that we tested, most showed a dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and VSV infections in MA104 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nigericin, brefeldin A, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) had effective concentration to reach 50% inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>) values lower than 2 μM against both VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and VSV infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nitazoxanide was recently reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and we observed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, we noticed that MG132, a broad-spectrum proteasome inhibitor, exhibited a 100-fold selectivity in antiviral activities against VSV (EC<sub>50</sub> of 44.4 μM) and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.64 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Notably, neither of the two reporter viruses express M<sup>pro</sup> and the only difference lies in the VSV glycoprotein replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This data, together with the previous report of MG132 and SARS-CoV, led us to further test the antiviral activities of MG132 and other calpain inhibitors and their effect on the spike protein.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Calpain inhibitors strongly inhibit VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P6">To examine whether MG132 targeting host calpain proteases accounts for the inhibition observed, we tested a set of commercially available calpain inhibitors, including ALLN (also known as MG101 or calpain inhibitor I), calpain inhibitor III, calpeptin, and E-64d, since these calpain inhibitors vary in their specificities targeting different members of the calpain family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. With the exception of calpeptin, none of the inhibitors were cytotoxic even at the highest concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). All four calpain inhibitors exhibited potent inhibition against VSV-SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub> values lower than 1.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin, which are more inhibitory against CAPN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], showed stronger efficacy than ALLN and E-64d, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 231 nM and 208 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). VSV was reported to not be sensitive to E-64d treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Consistently, all four calpain inhibitors were substantially less inhibitory against VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). For instance, calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin had EC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.67 μM and 7.43 μM, respectively, indicating a more than 30-fold increase when compared to VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition to MA104 cells, the antiviral activities of calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin against VSV-SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Notably, VSV-SARS-CoV-2 does not encode M<sup>pro</sup>, the key therapeutic target identified in many previous protease inhibitor studies. Therefore, the contrasting results of inhibition of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 compared to VSV and the more pronounced inhibitory effects seen with calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin prompted us to hypothesize that these calpain inhibitors may play a role in interfering with the activities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by inhibiting the host gene <italic>CAPN2</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection is significantly reduced in <italic>CAPN2</italic> knockout cells</title><p id="P8">To directly investigate the role of the host gene <italic>CAPN2</italic> in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we genetically knocked out <italic>CAPN2</italic> by lentivirus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 in MA104 cells, which express the endogenous ACE2 receptor that is necessary for virus entry. The <italic>CAPN2</italic> knockout (KO) efficiency was validated by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). WT and <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells were infected with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) and infectivity was determined at different time points post infection. We found that VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication, reflected by GFP signals, was highly attenuated in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells under all conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Consistently, intracellular viral mRNA levels were reduced by approximately 4-fold in the absence of CAPN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>), suggesting a pro-viral role of CAPN2 in VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further corroborate our findings, we performed standard plaque assays of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infections at MOIs of 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 in WT and <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells. 10 plaques from each group were selected and the diameters of plaque sizes were quantified. The plaques of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 formed in the KO cells had an average of diameter of 1 mm, significantly smaller than the 2 mm observed in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). To test whether this phenotype was associated with the spike protein, we performed similar plaque assays using VSV. No significant difference in sizes of VSV plaques was observed between WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that CAPN2 promotes the replication of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 but not VSV by acting on the spike protein or facilitating spike protein related functions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CAPN2 is required for an early step of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle</title><p id="P9">GFP signals from VSV-SARS-CoV-2 were reduced in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells at 6 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), suggesting that CAPN2 functions to aid viral infection within a single replication cycle. We next sought to pinpoint the time point when CAPN2 exerts its pro-viral effect. A time-course experiment was performed by infecting WT and KO cells with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and examining intracellular viral RNA levels at 1-6 hours post infection by RT-qPCR. Our results show that as early as 1 hour post infection, significantly lower viral mRNA levels were observed in the KO cells than those in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similar reduction was seen throughout the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). A similar trend was reflected by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein levels as the nascent protein synthesis was first visible starting at 4 hours post infection in WT cells, whereas it was barely detectable at 6 hours post infection in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we set out to evaluate the early pro-viral role of CAPN2 in the context of a clinical isolate of infectious (?) SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain). Consistent with our findings with VSV-SARS-CoV-2, WT SARS-CoV-2 infection yielded lower intracellular viral mRNA levels in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells than WT cells at 6 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Concurrent SARS-CoV-2 variants accumulate multiple mutations in the spike protein that result in enhanced transmission and antibody evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To that end, we tested a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strain with spike mutations in three key residues E484K, N501Y, and D614G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, although the mRNA levels trended lower in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells, the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that the effect of CAPN2 on SARS-CoV-2 is potentially dependent on the nature of spike proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CAPN2 promotes SARS-CoV-2 binding to host cells</title><p id="P11">As suggested by the reduced levels of viral mRNA levels as early as 1 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), we reasoned that CAPN2 may play an important role at a very early time point of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, i.e., virus binding and entry, which spike protein mediates. To test this hypothesis, we generated single clonal <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO MA104 cells, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>), and took advantage of a classical cold binding assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] using VSV-SARS-CoV-2 to assess whether viral adsorption is negatively impacted by the lack of CAPN2. The assay was performed at 4 °C to allow virus binding to host cells but limit the energy required for virus endocytosis to gain entry into cells, followed by extensive wash and RT-qPCR analysis. As a positive control, we included a neutralizing antibody (2B04) that targets spike from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], the preincubation of which significantly reduced binding of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Importantly, we found that the viral RNA levels from the virions bound to the KO cells were comparable to those in WT cells in the presence of antibody incubation and significantly lower than those in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Similar binding defects in the KO cells were observed with WT SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Viral binding in the KO cells were essentially reduced to the background levels similar to the antibody incubation controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To dissect the mechanism underlying reduced viral binding in the absence of CAPN2, we tested potential spike cleavage by CAPN2 given its role as a protease. We co-transfected HEK293 cells stably expressing human ACE2 with spike derived from WA1 strain, along with EGFP (control), CAPN2, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), or furin, the major proteases known to cleave spike for efficient entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The cells lysates were harvested and the intensities of the full-length spike and its cleaved product S2 fragment were quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). The spike cleavage efficiency was plotted as percentage of the cleavage product within overall spike protein levels. In this assay, overexpression of V5-tagged CAPN2 did not lead to significant spike cleavage more than EGFP, the negative control, when compared to other host proteases such as TMPRSS2 and furin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we examined the levels of SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor ACE2 in WT and <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells. Interestingly, although the transcriptional level of ACE2 was slightly but statistically lower in <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), this difference was not reflected on the bulk protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Of note, when we stained for subcellular localization of ACE2 in WT and KO cells, we observed much higher levels of surface ACE2 in WT cells co-localizing with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) at the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy, in contrast to higher levels of intracellular ACE2 seen in the KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Co-localization analysis of ACE2 and WGA, indicated by yellow signals in the inset images, showed that the surface ACE2 levels were significantly reduced in the <italic>CAPN2</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E and F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that CAPN2 positively regulates the presence of ACE2 at the cell surface, thus enhancing spike-mediated SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral infectivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, employs the spike protein that engages surface ACE2 to bind to host cells and is primed by TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], as well as host cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L for entry into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Many proteases contribute to viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of immunopathology during COVID-19 diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. In this study, we uncovered the host protease CAPN2 as a novel host factor that aides the infection of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P15">CAPN2 plays a major role in cancer-related cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Although participation of calpains in virus infections has not been well understood, several published studies indicate pro-viral functions of the host gene CAPN2. CAPN2 expression was discovered to be an indicator of level of hepatic fibrosis during hepatitis B virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Additionally, CAPN2 enhances replication of echovirus 1 at a late stage step during the viral replication cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and CAPN2 promotes coxsackievirus entry into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In our study, we utilized the recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 and observed viral inhibition by calpain inhibitors through a series of experiments using chemical inhibitors, genetic knockouts, and classical virological approaches. Unlikethe literature describing the direct role of CAPN2 in viral entry and assembly, we show that CAPN2 also promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection by acting early to aid virus binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Further studies are needed to understand whether CAPN2 modulates ACE2 endosomal trafficking, recycling, or degradation.</p><p id="P16">Our current study has a number of limitations. The calpain inhibitors are not tested in primary human airway epithelial cells and their therapeutic utility is not yet explored to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in relevant animal models. Another caveat is the frequency of mutations in the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 strains. The relevance of CAPN2 to SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be strain-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C and D</xref>), which we do not yet fully understand. Nonetheless, our findings highlight a novel function of CAPN2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry and offer an alternative explanation to the protective efficacy of calpain inhibitors independent of blocking M<sup>pro</sup> activities.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Reagents, cells, and viruses</title><sec id="S11"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P17">MG132 (Selleckchem, S2619), gefitinib (Selleckchem, S1025), nigericin (InvivoGen, tlrl-nig/NIG-36-01), brefeldin A (Cell Signaling Technology, 9972S), FTY720 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-202161A), IBMX, concanamycin A (Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-380-034-C025), tetrandrine (Selleckchem, S2403), U18666A (Cayman Chemical, 10009085), ETP-46464 (Selleckchem, S8050), JIB-04 (Tocris, 4972), nitazoxanide (COVID Box, MMV688991), ketoconazole (COVID Box, MMV637533), AG-1478 (Selleckchem, S2728), caffeic acid (Selleckchem, S7414), thapsigargin (Cell Signaling Technology, 1278S), staurosporine (Cell Signaling Technology, 9953S), arbidol-HCl (Selleckchem, S2120).

Expression of each gene was normalized to the expression of housekeeping gene GAPDH as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Western Blot</title><p id="P24">Cells were washed with PBS and lysed by RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, 89901) supplemented with 100X protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 78420), followed by a 10-minute incubation on ice. Cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 13,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove cell debris and chromatids. The protein samples were then boiled in 2X Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, #1610737EDU) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Prepared samples were run in 4-12% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in TBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature before incubation at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies: SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Sino Biological, 40592-T62), GAPDH (BioLegend, 631402), calpain-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2539), ACE2 (R&amp;D Systems, MAB933), S2 (Sino Biological, 40590-T62), and V5 (Cell Signaling Technology, 13202S). Membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated in secondary antibodies accordingly: anti-mouse HRP-linked IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S) or anti-rabbit HRP-linked IgG (Invitrogen, A27036) diluted in 5% BSA in TBST at room temperature for 1 hour.
