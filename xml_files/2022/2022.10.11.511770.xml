However, the regulatory determinants of domain co-activity remain unclear. Here, we leverage human individual variation in gene expression to characterize the co-regulatory processes underlying domain co-activity and systematically quantify their effect sizes. We employ transcriptional decomposition to extract from RNA expression data an expression component related to co-activity revealed by genomic positioning. This strategy reveals close to 1,500 co-activity domains, covering most expressed genes, of which the large majority are invariable across individuals. Focusing specifically on domains with high variability in co-activity reveals that contained genes have a higher sharing of eQTLs, a higher variability in enhancer interactions, and an enrichment of binding by variably expressed transcription factors compared to genes within non-variable domains. Through careful quantification of the relative contributions of regulatory processes underlying co-activity, we find transcription factor expression levels to be the main determinant of gene co-activity. Our results indicate that distal <italic>trans</italic> effects contribute more than local genetic variation to individual variation in co-activity domains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Gene expression is the integrated result of multiple gene regulatory processes acting at scales ranging from local binding of transcription factors (TFs) at regulatory elements (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Spitz &amp; Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lambert <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Andersson &amp; Sandelin, 2020</xref>) to permissive chromatin environments ensured by large-scale chromatin topologies and histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Robson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Schoenfelder &amp; Fraser, 2019</xref>). Aberrant gene activity may thus result from alterations in any of such regulatory processes. Disentangling the regulatory mechanisms acting upon each gene in its native context is therefore crucial for understanding the basis of transcriptional regulation and, ultimately, the role of dysregulation in disease.</p><p id="P3">Groups of genes expressed in a cell are often co-regulated, in that they are regulated by the same regulatory processes, e.g., having a common set of TFs binding their promoters or enhancers or even having shared distal enhancers, thereby ensuring coordinated transcription, or co-expression, in foci with high TF concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Robson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Pachano <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Similarly, co-regulation through shared localization within domains of permissive or repressive histone PTMs ensures accurate coordinated activation or repression for multiple genes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Coleman &amp; Struhl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zenk <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Analysis of co-expression can therefore yield insights into the regulatory processes acting on genes through co-regulation.</p><p id="P4">Topologically associating domains (TADs) have been suggested to confine interactions between regulatory elements within genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Symmons <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) and insulate repressed genes from active domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Narendra <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, while deletions of TAD boundaries or chromosomal inversions may disrupt TAD-contained regulatory wirings and cause gene dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gröschel <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Laugsch <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; Lupiáñez <italic>et al</italic>, 2015), the proper formation of TADs only has a marginal contribution to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ghavi-Helm <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Nora <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). This is reflected by only a minor agreement between gene co-regulation and TAD co-localization across active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Soler-Oliva <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zufferey <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Co-expression can, for instance, be measured by quantifying the correlation between expression levels of genes across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hawrylycz <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), assessing to what extent gene sets have a concordant differential expression between cell types or conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zufferey <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) or to what degree they define cellular identity in single cell experiments (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Crow &amp; Gillis, 2018</xref>). While analysis of gene regulatory differences between cell types may successfully capture differential activity between TFs or domain repression, studying variation in gene expression between individuals within the same cell type has indicated other regulatory patterns, which may appear comparatively subtle in relation to between cell type effects. Within the same cell type, a major determinant of co-expression is genomic proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kustatscher <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), suggesting that data across individuals for the same cell type might better reveal the regulatory activities underlying co-regulation in the absence of strong cell-type specific differences.</p><p id="P6">Quantifying co-regulatory effect sizes is, however, complicated by the fact that regulatory processes may impact the coordinated expression of two or more genes, referred to as co-activity, differently from the expression of individual genes. It is conceivable that certain regulatory processes may primarily control co-activity, while other regulatory processes may have a larger influence on expression level. Decoding transcriptional regulation thus requires an accurate quantification of the effect sizes of both regulatory processes acting on individual genes and those driving co-activity. To this end, we recently developed an approach to decompose RNA expression data into an expression component related to genomic positioning and a location-independent component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). The position-dependent component accurately captures domains of chromatin compartments and their activities and reveals large-scale co-activity patterns between neighboring genes, indicating a sizable effect of regulatory processes modulating co-activity in genomic neighborhoods.</p><p id="P7">Here, we make use of the transcriptional decomposition approach to investigate and quantify the changes in regulatory processes underlying variability in co-activity in a genotyped panel of lymphoblastoid cells profiled by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lappalainen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). We identify domains of co-active genes and show that gene co-activity on the domain level is largely invariable between individuals. We then focus specifically on sub-domains exhibiting high individual variation, in order to characterize the regulatory processes influencing their co-activity. We find that variability in co-activity largely reflects histone PTM variation and that genes contained within variable co-activity domains have a higher sharing of eQTLs, a higher number and variability of interactions with enhancers, and are enriched in specific TF binding sites, which are bound by more variably expressed TFs. Finally, in an attempt to quantify the combined effects of regulatory processes underlying co-activity, we find that the expression levels of TFs explain on average more of the observed variation in co-activity at variable domains than local genetic variation or interactions. Our study thus highlights TF expression as the main determinant of gene co-activity, which has implications for continued efforts in characterizing the role of transcriptional dysregulation in disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptional decomposition captures positionally dependent gene co-activities</title><p id="P8">We have previously established transcriptional decomposition as an accurate approach to decompose the portion of transcriptional activities influenced by the genomic neighborhood (positionally dependent component) from those independent of the genomic position (positionally independent component) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). As the positionally dependent component reveals shared activity patterns between neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), we here sought to leverage this modeling approach to investigate individual variation in regulatory processes underlying gene co-activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, we made use of RNA-seq data from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from a panel of 343 individuals from four european and one african populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lappalainen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</p><p id="P9">To capture positional dependencies influencing gene activity and investigate how these vary across individuals, we modeled the positionally dependent portion of expression data independently in each LCL using aggregated expression in 10 kb tiled windows of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We henceforth refer to the positionally dependent component of expression data as a co-activity score. In general, the resulting co-activity scores exhibited strong inter-individual correspondence (mean pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC): 0.94; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), akin to the resemblance between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). We note that this score, by definition, does not necessarily have to reflect the correlation of expression between neighboring transcription units but the portion of expression that is dependent on such proximity. However, gene pairs that had a higher and more similar co-activity score tended to have higher co-expression (mean PCC across LCLs) than those with low or dissimilar co-activity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In agreement with previously observed similarities between RNA-seq and Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE)-derived transcriptional components of GM12878 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), we observed that the proportion of expression attributed to co-activity derived from different assays correlated better between individuals of the same cell type (LCL GM12872 RNA-seq versus LCL GM12878 CAGE, PCC = 0.8) than between cell types (LCL GM12872 RNA-seq vs HeLa or HepG2 CAGE, PCC = 0.73 and 0.73, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). This demonstrates that transcriptional components derived from RNA-seq reflect those of CAGE. It further indicates that cell-type specific regulatory activities are reflected by changes in co-activity and that these can be captured by transcriptional decomposition of RNA-seq data.</p><p id="P11">Taken together, we conclude that transcriptional decomposition of RNA-seq data reveals co-activity, indicating that its application to human panels may reveal the genetic basis of variation in gene co-activity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Positional dependencies of expression reveal co-activity domains of shared regulation</title><p id="P12">Since we observed stronger co-expression among pairs of genes associated with a positive co-activity score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), we reasoned that its sign could be used to define domains of shared transcriptional regulation between genes influencing their co-activity (referred to as co-activity domains, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> for an example locus). We defined co-activity domains as genomic regions having a positive co-activity in at least 15% of individuals and containing at least two expressed annotated genes. Subsequent merging of proximal domains resulted in a set of 1,489 co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; median domain length: 570 kb; median number of active genes per domain: 8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2B</xref>), noting that the genomic extent of domains appears robust to the percentage of individuals considered in the calculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). These domains contained the majority (88%) of expressed genes in LCLs, in agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and spanned 44% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To characterize properties of derived co-activity domains, we first investigated whether the domains reflected chromatin states. Indeed, active chromatin compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) accounted for 75% of the total genomic size of co-activity domains, compared to only 10% of background regions with negatively signed co-activity scores. In contrast, heterochromatin compartments made up 75% of background regions and 15% of co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In support, co-activity domains were associated with almost four times more open chromatin regions than what was observed for background regions (0.93 versus 0.27 ATAC-seq open chromatin sites per 10 kb, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In general, the correlation between co-activity score and activating histone modifications was higher in co-activity domains than in background regions of negative co-activity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The proportion of genomic size showing a significant correlation (Pearson correlation test; Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1) was also higher in co-activity domains than in background regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>), when compared across 79 individuals with associated histone ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grubert <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We reasoned that the enrichment in physical contacts within TADs should be reflected by the observed positional dependency in transcription within co-activity domains. In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), we observed that TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dekker <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) were enriched at boundaries of co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, Fisher’s exact test, t = 1.5, <italic>P</italic> = 1.5×10<sup>-5</sup>). These results are further supported by a higher expression correlation between neighboring active genes within co-activity domains compared to gene pairs outside of domains (PCC: 0.30 and 0.20 respectively).</p><p id="P15">Next, we asked how genes located within co-activity domains compared to genes outside of domains with respect to their links to regulatory elements. To this end, we applied activity-by-contact (ABC) modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fulco <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) to predict regulatory interaction maps for 79 of the 343 individuals with available chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Degner <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gorkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) and H3K27ac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gorkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grubert <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) data. Using these maps, we observed a general association between the number of associated enhancers and the expression of genes (Spearman’s rho 0.440, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>), with multi-enhancer genes having a higher expression than those with few or no predicted enhancers. In addition, genes within co-activity domains were generally less variable in their number of ABC-associated enhancers (<italic>P</italic> = 1.1×10<sup>-8</sup>; Wicoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). This is likely in part explained by their association with higher gene expression levels, since more variably interacting genes had lower average expression (Spearman’s rho −0.46; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). Similarly, genes located in co-activity domains were on average associated with more enhancers than those in background regions (1.8 versus 1.6 connections per gene on average, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0016, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also asked whether there was a connection between gene expression and interaction numbers per gene on the individual level. On average, an individual’s expression for a gene showed no or only weak correlation with its corresponding number of ABC-connections (PCC = 0.07). While this might reflect ABC measures being influenced by noise in the input data, the expression of 62 genes showed significant correlation with the number of interactions (Pearson correlation test; BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1), for which the correlation sign was positive in 90% of cases. This suggests that the number of regulatory interactions reflects a gene’s expression level within a co-activity domain, but that only few regulatory domains are sensitive to perturbations at an individual level.</p><p id="P16">Since genes within the same co-activity domain are assumed to share regulation, we investigated the co-operative capacity of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) on genes within the same domain. We focused on genes associated with at least one eQTL (eGenes). Overall, we found that 38% of neighboring eGene pairs contained within the same co-activity domain shared at least one eQTL, compared to only 7% of eGene pairs located outside of co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, this result could not be explained by differences in the distances between eGene pairs inside or outside of co-activity domains. In fact, we observed a significant enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1×10<sup>-5</sup>) of shared eQTLs among eGene pairs in co-activity domains even when only considering pairs at least 100 kb apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Taken together, these results indicate that co-activity domains are capturing local neighborhoods of genes, whose collective output is influenced by an environment enriched in regulatory interactions, permissive chromatin, and the co-operative effects of local sequence variants.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptional variation across individuals uncovers regulatory mechanisms underlying co-activity</title><p id="P18">In general, we observed a strong conformity in the positional co-activity scores across all individuals, but noted the presence of sub-regions within co-activity domains displaying considerable variation between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Accordingly, and as a basis for understanding regulation of co-activity, we focused on regions that differed in co-activity between individuals, and thus presumably in the activity of their underlying shared regulatory mechanisms. We characterized genomic regions within co-activity domains involving two or more expressed genes and showing high variability (standard deviation &gt; 0.6) in their average co-activity scores across the panel of individuals. This identified a total of 212 genomic regions, which we refer to as variable co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). For example, we detected considerable variation in co-activity scores in the variable co-activity domain containing genes <italic>RP11-588H23</italic>.<italic>3</italic> and <italic>RP11-785D18</italic>.<italic>3</italic> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> for 3 individuals, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref> for all individuals). These two genes correlated in their expression more strongly than the rest of the genes in the encompassing co-activity domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Indeed, the observation that genes in variable co-activity domains are co-expressed to a higher degree held genome-wide. For comparative purposes, we sampled a matched set of non-variable co-activity domains from the whole set of co-activity domains, which did not overlap with the set of variable co-activity domains, but displayed similar mean co-activities, genomic sizes, and gene numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B-C</xref>). In general, neighboring gene pairs in variable co-activity domains were more co-expressed (PCC of gene expression across LCLs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) than genes contained in the matched non-variable domains, suggesting a shared regulation of genes within variable co-activity domains with an effect size stronger than that of non-variable co-activity domains.</p><p id="P19">Next, we investigated which mechanisms are associated with individual variability in variable co-activity domains. We hypothesized that inter-individual variation could be associated with at least four (non-orthogonal) gene regulatory inputs: histone modifications, TF binding, enhancer-promoter interactions, and genetic variants.</p><p id="P20">We first asked if the average co-activity score in variable co-activity domains was reflective of the chromatin state across individuals. Interestingly, the number of open chromatin regions did not differ significantly between the variable and matched non-variable co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). Still, genes in variable co-activity domains had 20% more ABC-predicted interactions, as well as a 20% higher interaction variability compared to matched non-variable co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Overall, the average co-activity scores invariable co-activity domains correlated strongly with H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, and these correlations were more pronounced than in the set of matched non-variable co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), and more likely to be statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). The association between variability in histone modification levels and variability in positional co-activity scores is clear in the variable co-activity domain at the <italic>MARC1-2</italic> gene locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), showing that H3K27ac matches both the variance and rank of co-activity scores across individuals.</p><p id="P21">Domains of co-varying histone modifications have previously been described as variable chromatin modules (VCMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Waszak <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Delaneau <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). These modules/domains, which are on average shorter than the variable co-activity domains described here (Median 52 kb, mean 138 kb; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>), showed a high enrichment in variable co-activity domains (odds ratio 6; Fisher’s exact test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2×10<sup>-6</sup>). In fact, VCMs accounted for as much as 85% coverage of variable co-activity domains, indicating that variable chromatin domains are capturing the same variability, although through smaller domains. This further demonstrates that variation in co-activity can be derived from orthogonal assays, including those measuring histone modifications. Thus, it appears that chromatin state reflects co-activity domain variability.</p><p id="P22">Another possible explanation for the variation in variable co-activity domains is the variable expression of TFs preferentially binding to regulatory elements in these domains. Of 83 tested TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) with experimentally identified binding sites in LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dunham <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), we found that TF binding sites (TFBSs) for NFATC1, CEBPB, EP300, BMI1, ATF2, TBX21, NFIC, BCL11A, and BATF were enriched in open chromatin regions of variable co-activity domains compared to open chromatin regions in the wider set of co-activity domains (Fisher’s exact test, BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of these, TFBSs for BATF and NFIC were also enriched, although to a lesser extent, in the matched non-variable co-activity domains. This can possibly be explained by variable and matched non-variable co-activity domains sharing certain properties (e.g., mean co-activity score, number of genes and domain size; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). Among the identified TFs associated with domain variability, we find both those that are expressed across multiple cell types and tissues (EP300, BMI1,</p><p id="P23">ATF2, NFIC) and those that are immune-cell related (NFATC1, CEBPB, TBX21, BCL11A, BATF). Two of the latter TFs, TBX21 and BATF, further show LCL-biased expression across cell types and tissues (The GTEx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Consortium, 2020</xref>), suggesting that their association with co-activity domains and the variability at these domains may be cell-type specific. Interestingly, the more enriched the TFBSs for a given TF were within variable co-activity domains, the more variable we observed the expression of the TF itself to be (PCC: 0.34, Pearson correlation test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The same pattern was observed for the matched non-variable co-activity domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>), although the association was weaker (PCC 0.25, Pearson correlation test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.022). One possible reason for this relationship could be that more variably expressed genes tend to be bound by more variably expressed TFs (PCC 0.31, Pearson correlation test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0052, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).

Principal component analysis revealed a separation by ancestry of the individuals for the co-activity scores, but less so for the positionally independent component or the raw expression data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that individual genetic variation influences individual differences in the regulation of gene co-activities. We found that 58% of neighboring gene pairs contained in variable co-activity domains shared an eQTL (controlled for population stratification), compared to 42% and 38% in matched co-activity domains and the full set of co-activity domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In contrast, 51% (108 out of 212) of the matched non-variable co-activity domains were associated with co-activity QTLs. Thus, the association between genotype and co-activity score was stronger but not unique to variable domains. We speculate that this is due to the fact that there is some inter-individual variability also in matched domains, although to a lower degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). However, the total number of co-activity QTLs associated with variable co-activity domains was higher (1,323 compared to 876 for variable and matched non-variable co-activity domains, respectively), and co-activity QTLs explained a larger fraction of co-activity variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and were associated with larger effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) for variable co-activity domains.</p><p id="P26">Taken together, through a systematic investigation of regulatory processes acting upon variable co-activity domains, we conclude that all investigated regulatory inputs, i.e. histone modifications, TF binding, enhancer-promoter interactions, and genetic variants, associate with variability in co-activity, suggesting that careful deconvolution is required to estimate their individual regulatory effect sizes influencing co-activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transcription factor expression is the dominant regulatory determinant of co-activity</title><p id="P27">To estimate the relative effects of different regulatory mechanisms influencing co-activity, we employed multiple linear regression and calculated the individual contributions of predicted enhancer-promoter interactions, genetic variation, and TF activities to the co-activity scores in each variable co-activity domain (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>).

Then, for the 29 individuals with measured ABC interactions we considered the following as predictors in an additive linear model: the total number interactions for genes in the domain, the QSS and the log of the expression levels for either each of the 10 most predictive TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>) or the single most predictive TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A-B</xref>) for that domain.

While the relative proportions of variance explained by the individual regulatory inputs also varied across the domains, in the majority of cases (95%, or 202 out of 212), the largest proportion of the explained variance was accounted for by the expression of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) (58%, or 123 out of 212, when considering only a single TF, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). This demonstrates that TF expression variation is the dominant regulatory determinant of co-activity. We observed similar results when we omitted the ABC interactions from the model, allowing modeling on the full set of 343 individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P30">To strengthen our conclusions of the relative importance of each regulatory mechanism to co-activity, we compared models by monitoring the change in R<sup>2</sup> after omitting each predictor but retaining the others (ANOVA, Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). We found that TF expression was a significant predictor in 96 out of the 212 analyzed domains (45% of domains, dropping to 42% for the single TF models), compared to 37 domains for which the QSS was a significant predictor (17%, raising to 23% for the single TF models). There were 17 domains (8%, increasing to 15% for the single TF models) for which the number of predicted enhancer-promoter interactions was significantly associated with variability in co-activity, with the increases in the single TF models suggesting that variation in the expression of a TF, local genotype and the enhancer-promoter interactions do not behave fully orthogonally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). In support, when modeling co-activity scores using only ABC interactions as a single term, the percentage of variance explained by that predictor increased from 3% based on the full model to 5%, and the term was significant in 32 domains (15%). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, substituting the genotype of the top co-activity QTL for the QSS yielded a slightly lower percentage of variance explained for the genotype term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6F-G</xref>), indicating that the inclusion of multiple QTLs into a single QSS adds explanatory power.</p><p id="P31">We speculated that the strong association between TF expression and variability in variable co-activity domains could be partly explained by eQTLs in <italic>cis</italic> of the TF genes themselves. Of 25 TFs identified as having both local eQTLs and being associated with co-activity levels in at least one variable co-activity domain, the lead SNP could explain 7% of TF expression variance on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Based on these results, we conclude that co-activity is explained by a combination of both cis-effects, including local sequence variation and enhancer-promoter interactions, and trans-effects resulting from variations in TF expression likely acting via binding sites shared by genes in the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In all, we identify TF expression as the strongest determinant of co-activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">In this study, we made use of the transcriptional decomposition approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rennie <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) to investigate regulatory mechanisms driving co-activity across a wide panel of LCLs from 343 healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lappalainen <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Transcriptional decomposition enabled the derivation of a co-activity score that reflects the portion of expression attributable to positional contexts. Put in another way, we excluded the portion of expression that can be explained by a given gene independently of its neighboring genes. Measuring co-activity in this way is useful for two reasons: for the first, it separates noise from the underlying signal representing shared regulatory effects within chromosomes, thereby allowing us to identify domains of co-regulation, with a nuance importantly differing from approaches based on co-expression between neighboring pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kustatscher <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) or co-variable histone PTM domains (VCM/CRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Delaneau <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Waszak <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Secondly, using co-activity scores allowed us to pin-point regulatory mechanisms which may explain specific positional contexts. In other words, we asked if we could explain the necessity of groups of genes to be in genomic proximity in terms of the regulation of their activities.</p><p id="P33">Overall, co-activity scores within defined co-activity domains appeared stable across individuals and were reflective of local chromatin states, conforming to observations that topological and compartment domains have a tendency to remain consistent across cell types and individuals in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gorkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rao <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the co-regulatory potential within a domain was manifested by shared eQTLs having an impact on multiple genes within the same domain, supported by observations of eGene pairs situated in close proximity within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Strunz <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We found regions within co-activity domains that displayed significant variability in co-activities to be particularly interesting, as their analysis allowed for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving their variability. In general, such variable co-activity domains showed strong overlap with VCMs. VCMs were previously identified also in LCLs in a similar population of healthy individuals and, similar to our co-activity domains, are also enriched in chromatin contacts and genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Waszak <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Our work shows that co-activity alone reflects properties captured by profiles of histone modifications from which VCMs are derived, albeit on a broader scale and approached from an alternative angle.</p><p id="P34">When compared to their non-variable counterparts, controlling for gene numbers and size, variable co-activity domains were found to possess unique characteristics. These domains were associated with higher enrichments for binding sites of variably expressed TFs, more variability in interaction numbers across individuals, and a greater impact from local genotypes. The latter was manifested both through higher numbers of shared eQTLs and on average higher effect sizes of QTLs on co-activity than those in non-variable domains. This supports a model where high variability in domain-scale activities is driven by high levels of variable regulatory inputs acting on a given locality (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Andersson &amp; Sandelin, 2020</xref>). These inputs are acting either in cis or in trans, and potentially separated from additional mechanisms controlling independent regulation at individual genes, such as via binding to specific core promoter sequences. While it can be assumed that these types of inputs also drive co-activity in non-variable domains, we do note that variable domains could display intrinsic differences in their regulation. For instance, a strong correlation between TF abundance and transcriptional (co-)activity of genes might mean a reduced complexity in the TF binding grammar at their promoters. Indeed, differences in variability have been associated with differences in core promoter architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Einarsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sigalova <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), in addition to differences in chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Faure <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) and regulatory inputs from distal enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sigalova <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P35">In this study, we utilized the ABC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fulco <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) to predict gene interactions in 29 out of the 343 individuals in the panel. Our finding that only 62 genes showed significant correlation between numbers of associated interactions and expression levels is supported by the finding that very few loci with a variable chromatin state at enhancers could be linked to expression changes of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Waszak <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), and that enhancer variability did not result in differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kasowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). This could possibly reflect buffering activities of enhancers working together to achieve regulatory robustness within domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Osterwalder <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). We note, however, that our result could also reflect low sensitivities in the called interactions, in part due to differences across individuals in the resolution of input data used for modeling. However, the fact that 90% of these genes had a correlation which was positive suggests that we are not simply capturing noise. In addition, studying naturally occurring variation in enhancer-promoter interactions across individuals within the same cell type could limit our detection of perturbed enhancer-promoter interactions that cause large changes in gene expression, as opposed to the expected impact of enhancer-promoter re-wiring across different cell types.</p><p id="P36">Our results reveal that, relative to local effects of eQTLs and ABC-predicted interactions, TF abundance is the strongest driver of co-activity variability. This concurs with previous observations that TF abundance influences coordinated variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Delaneau <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The strong association between TF expression variability and variability in domain co-activity lead us to hypothesize that local genotype variation in <italic>cis</italic> to TF genes drives trans-effects on co-activity in variable domains. This hypothesis is supported by observations that, while the majority of genes are associated with local eQTLs (The GTEx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Consortium, 2020</xref>), there is a sizable portion of variation that cannot directly be explained by local genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), suggesting that distal variation may contribute to a sizable proportion of expression variation <italic>in trans</italic>.

To create a list of putative target genes per TF, promoter areas (2 kb upstream and 200 bp downstream of annotated TSSs) of all genes were overlapped with TF ChIP-seq peaks.</p><p id="P61">The binding of TFs in open chromatin regions (OCRs) in co-activity domains was assessed using 83 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq peaks. Contingency tables were constructed with counts reflecting the whether the OCR was in a variable co-activity domain (versus a non-variable co-activity domain), combined with whether or not it had at least one binding site for the TF in question. Using these contingency tables, Fisher’s exact tests were performed. The same was repeated using matched non-variable co-activity domains instead of variable co-activity domains, against the background of positive co-activity domains.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>JASPAR TFBS analysis</title><p id="P62">JASPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Castro-Mondragon <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) predicted TFBS locations were obtained in bigBed format, and subsequently imported into R. For all analyses, a score cutoff of 200 was used. This score is the normalized weight according to the range of weights that can possibly be obtained given the PWM for that TF. The weight of a JASPAR predicted binding site is the probability of observing the site given the PWM divided by the probability of observing the site by random chance.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Co-activity QTL analysis</title><p id="P63">Co-activity QTL analysis was performed similar to the eQTL analysis described above, separately for variable and matched non-variable co-activity regions. The mean co-activity score per domain was used, and domains were treated as genes. The first 3 genotype PCs and the first 15 co-activity PCs across variable/matched domains were included as covariates.</p><p id="P64">LD filtering was done by iteratively removing QTLs. First, all QTLs which had a genotype correlation with the top QTL (by significance) of &gt; 0.8 were removed. Then, all QTLs which had a genotype correlation of &gt; 0.8 with the QTL with the second lowest p-value were removed, and so on, until all remaining QTLs had a genotype correlation of &lt; 0.8 with all other QTLs.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>QTL summary score (QSS)</title><p id="P65">To summarize QTLs into a single score, all QTLs were first polarized with regards to the sign of their effect size, by inverting all genotypes for QTLs with a negative effect size, and taking the absolute effect size. Next, the effect sizes were used to weigh the contribution of risk alleles (now defined as leading to an increase in effect size). Thus, the mean of genotypes was computed, weighted by the effect size. A QSS closer to 2 indicates the individual has a combined cis genotype that is more likely to lead to a higher co-activity score.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Selecting the top 10 most predictive TFs per variable region</title><p id="P66">In order to robustly select transcription factors most closely associated with domain co-activity variability, a Random Forest (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Wright &amp; Ziegler, 2017</xref>) model was first constructed for each co-activity domain, using the mean co-activity score per domain as response, and the TF expression levels for the 83 TFs that have ENCODE experimental binding data in GM12878 as predictors. The data was split into five training and five validation sets and models were run using five-fold cross-validation, requesting “impurity” importance scores. The importance scores for each TF were averaged over the five folds, and the 10 TFs with the highest average importance score were selected. A linear model was then constructed using each of these TFs as the explanatory variable, and the proportion of variance explained (r-squared) was noted. The whole process was repeated 3 times, and the most frequently occurring 10 TFs over all top 10 TFs or the most frequently occuring top single TF (according to R<sup>2</sup>) over all runs was used in the following modeling.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Multiple linear model to investigate proportion of variance explained</title><p id="P67">For each variable co-activity domain, a multiple linear model (MLM) was constructed, using the following predictors over the set of 29 individuals with overlapping data availability: the total number of ABC connections, the QSS of cis co-activity QTLs, and the expression values of top associated TFs (10 most predictive or single most predictive TF). The dependent variable was the average co-activity score in the domain. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), we calculated the proportions of the type II sum of squares attributed to each of the predictors, including the TFs as a single predictor group in the case where the top 10 was included. To make sure no overfitting was occurring due to the limited set of considered individuals, two additional models were constructed, involving as predictors the QSS and TF expression (top 10 or top single TF) for 343 individuals. For further comparison and assessment of the robustness of the QSS measure, models were constructed using the genotype of the most significant co-activity QTL per region, instead of the QSS. In order to calculate the significance of predictors on the given domain, adjusting for the other terms in the model, each predictor was held out one by one, and the linear model without that predictor was compared to the full model containing all of the predictions using ANOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures and table legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS155789-supplement-Supplementary_figures_and_table_legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d68aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary tables 1-5</label><media xlink:href="EMS155789-supplement-Supplementary_tables_1_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d68aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S27" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="P68">Co-activity scores and ABC predicted interactions are available at Zenodo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7180322">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7180322</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">van Duin <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P69">We would like to thank all members of the Andersson lab at the University of Copenhagen for their rewarding comments and discussions during the project.

Via approximate Bayesian modeling, normalized RNA expression count data, quantified in 10 kb genomic bins (shown left for three individuals), are decomposed into a co-activity component, which is positionally dependent, and a positionally independent component (shown right).
