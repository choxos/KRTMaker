Here we examine the neutralization resistance of these subvariants, as well as their ancestral BA.4/5, BA.2.75 and D614G variants, against sera from 3-dose vaccinated health care workers, hospitalized BA.1-wave patients, and BA.5-wave patients. We found enhanced neutralization resistance in all new subvariants, especially the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants driven by a key N460K mutation, and to a lesser extent, R346T and K444T mutations, as well as the BA.2.75.2 subvariant driven largely by its F486S mutation. The BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants also exhibited enhanced fusogenicity and S processing dictated by the N460K mutation. Interestingly, the BA.2.75.2 subvariant saw an enhancement by the F486S mutation and a reduction by the D1199N mutation to its fusogenicity and S processing, resulting in minimal overall change. Molecular modelling revealed the mechanisms of receptor-binding and non-receptor binding monoclonal antibody-mediated immune evasion by R346T, K444T, F486S and D1199N mutations. Altogether, these findings shed light on the concerning evolution of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since its emergence in late 2021, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced numerous subvariants that continue to erode vaccine- and infection-induced immunity, and alter virus biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kurhade et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Qu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Qu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Xia et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Yamasoba et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). The initial BA.1 Omicron subvariant spurned a large wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and exhibited strong immune escape from 2-mRNA vaccine dose-induced immunity that was recovered by booster mRNA vaccine administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cao et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cerutti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gruell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Xia et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zou et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the BA.1 subvariant exhibited reduced cell-cell fusogenicity, impaired replication in lower airway epithelial cells, as well as altered entry route preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Meng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shuai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>). These features correlated with a reduced replication capacity of Omicron in lung tissues, enhanced nasopharyngeal tropism, and decreased pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">McMahan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shuai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Su et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, these characteristics were largely maintained by subsequent Omicron subvariants.</p><p id="P3">The BA.2 subvariant overtook BA.1 due to its slightly enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion, with an ability to reinfect individuals who were previously infected with BA.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Iketani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lyngse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Stegger et al., 2022</xref>). From BA.2, several subvariants emerged in quick succession, often with concurrent circulations; these included the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants (bearing identical S proteins, referred to as BA.4/5 hereafter) that next rose to dominance and exhibited further immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cao et al., 2022c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hachmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Khan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kimura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Qu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Tuekprakhon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). In addition, BA.2 gave rise to the BA.2.75 subvariant, which is currently increasing in proportion of COVID-19 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022</xref>), but does not exhibit as substantial immune escape compared to BA.4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cao et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Qu et al., 2022a</xref>; Saito et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wang et al., 2022c</xref>). The BA.4/5 and BA.2.75 subvariants have driven further diversification of the circulating SARS-CoV-2, with the emergence of several additional subvariants including the BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 (derived from BA.4/5), as well as BA.2.75.2 (derived from BA.2.75). These new subvariants are currently increasing in frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Iacobucci, 2022</xref>) and may be the next major dominant Omicron subvariant.</p><p id="P4">The extent of immune evasion and functional alterations to the spike protein (S) in these emerging Omicron subvariants remains unclear. To address this, we examine the resistance of the BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2 subvariants to neutralization by serum from recipients of 3 mRNA vaccine doses, as well as COVID-19 patients infected with the BA.1 or BA.4/5 variants. We observe strong neutralization resistance in the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants driven largely by their key N460K mutation, as well as in the BA.2.75.2 subvariant driven largely by its singature F486S mutation. We further examine the fusogenicity and processing of the subvariant S proteins and observe enhanced fusogenicity and S processing in the BA.4/5-derived subvariants driven largely by the N460K mutation, but comparable fusogenicity and S processing in BA.2.75-derived BA.2.75.2 subvariant modulated by its F485S and D1199N mutations. Finally, structural modeling showed that the F486S mutation reduced binding affinity for both the ACE2 receptor and class I and II antibodies, while the R346T and K444T mutations are likely responsible for evasion of class III antibody recognition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>BQ.1, BQ1.1, and BA.2.75.2 exhibit potent neutralization resistance</title><p id="P5">To examine the neutralization resistance of emerging Omicron subvariants, we utilized our previously reported pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Lentivirus pseudotyped with S from each of the critical Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), as well as from the prototype D614G variant were produced. All Omicron subvariant-pseudotyped viruses exhibited modestly enhanced infectivity in HEK293T-ACE2 cells over the D614G variant, with the exception of BA.2.75.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additionally, all Omicron subvariants exhibited comparably poor infectivity in lung-derived CaLu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) compared to D614G, consistent with prior Omicron subvariants, and the weak lung tropism observed for the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Meng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shuai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next examined the resistance of these emerging Omicron subvariants to sera from health care workers (HCWs) collected 2-13 weeks after vaccination with a homologous booster dose of monovalent Moderna mRNA-1273 (n =3) or Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine (n =12). We observed potent neutralization resistance among all Omicron subvariants compared to ancestral D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Specifically, compared to D614G, the BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 subvariants exhibited a 10.6-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 11.0-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 18.7-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), and 22.9-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity, respectively, while BA.4/5 exhibited an 8.7-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity than D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Similarly, compared to D614G, the BA.2.75.2 subvariant exhibited a 48.4-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity while BA.2.75 exhibited a 4.4-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity than D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These data indicate further neutralization escape in emerging Omicron subvariants, with BA.Q.1, BA.Q.1.1, and BA.2.75.2, especially the latter, showing the most substantial neutralization resistance.</p><p id="P7">We also examined the resistance of Omicron subvariants to neutralization by sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n =15) infected during the BA.1 wave of the pandemic. Despite exposure to an Omicron antigen, these patients displayed a remarkably similar neutralization resistance pattern to the boosted HCWs. Specifically, compared to D614G, the BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 subvariants exhibited a 3.5-fold (p&gt;0.05), 3.2-fold (p &lt;0.05), 5.3-fold (p &lt;0.01), and 5.0-fold (p &lt;0.05) lower neutralization sensitivity, respectively, while BA.4/5 exhibited an 2.7-fold (p &lt;0.05) lower neutralization sensitivity than D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similarly, compared to D614G, the BA.2.75.2 subvariant exhibited a 6.3-fold (p &lt;0.01) lower neutralization sensitivity, while BA.2.75 exhibited a 3.9-fold (p &lt;0.01) lower neutralization resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). As would be expected, BA.1 patient sera neutralized BA.2 with a higher efficiency compared to these BA.2-derived subvariants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To determine the breadth of immunity from individuals infected with more recent Omicron subvariants, we next examined sera from Columbus, Ohio first responders and household contacts testing positive for COVID-19 during the BA.4/5 wave of the pandemic, with 11/20 subjects having the infecting variant confirmed as BA.4/5 or a derivative by sequencing. Notably, this cohort exhibited the weakest neutralizing antibody titers of the three groups examined, consistent with milder COVID-19 cases correlating with weaker neutralizing antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Critically, this cohort again displayed a similar pattern of neutralization resistance. Specifically, compared to D614G, the BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 subvariants exhibited a 3.9-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 4.4-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 10.4-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), and 10.7-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity, respectively, while BA.4/5 exhibited a 3.7-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity than D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, compared to D614G, the BA.2.75.2 subvariant exhibited a 10.6-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) lower neutralization sensitivity whereas BA.2.75 showed a 3.4-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) decreased neutralization sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Interestingly, BA.2 exhibited less resistance to sera of BA.4/5-wave infection than BA.4/5, with 2.1-fold reduced neutralization sensitivity compared to D614G (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Together, these results showed that BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2 are strongly resistant to neutralization by sera from subjects infected with the recently dominant BA.4/5 variant and suggested that BA.4/5 infection does not offer a broader protection against newly emerging subvariants.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>R346T, K444T, N460K, and F486S represent key neutralization escape mutations</title><p id="P9">To determine the features governing neutralization resistance, we produced single and double mutant S constructs to probe the contributions of individual amino acid substitutions alone or in combination to neutralization resistance. The panel of mutants exhibited largely similar infectivity compared to their parental BA.4/5 or BA.2.75 variants in HEK293T-ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) and Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>), although F486S-containing, BA.2.75-derived mutants appear to have modestly reduced titers in Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). For HCWs who received 3 mRNA vaccine doses introduction of the N460K mutation reduced neutralization sensitivity by an additional 2.6-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to the parental BA.4/5 subvariant, with a similar 2.8-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) reduction for the R346T/N460K double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the N460K-bearing subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 showed the strongest neutralization resistance, with a 2.1-fold (p &lt; 0.01) and 2.6-fold (p &lt; 0.01) reduction in neutralization sensitivity compared to BA.4/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Though not significant, the other key individual mutations, R346T and K444T, were associated with a milder 20.7% (p =0.0782) and 29.3% (p =0.1886) reduction in neutralization sensitivity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Similarly, the N658S mutation did not appear to be strongly associated with neutralization resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>), with a 23.7 % (p &gt; 0.05) reduction compared to the parental BA.4/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Altogether, these results showed that the N460K mutation, and to a lesser extent R346T, K444T and N658S, are critical for the enhanced resistance to mRNA booster-vaccinated sera in the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants.</p><p id="P10">For BA.2.75-derived mutants, the introduction of the F486S, R346T/F486S, or F486S/D1199N mutations reduced neutralization sensitivity by 5.2-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 12.8-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), 4.8-fold (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively, compared to the 10.9-fold (p &lt; 0.0001) reduction seen for the parental BA.2.75.2 subvariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, the introduction of the R346T, D1199N, or R346T/D1199N resulted in only a 26.3% (p = 0.1074), 22.1% (p &gt; 0.05), and 31.4% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in neutralization sensitivity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). These results indicated that the F486S mutation is the major driver of enhanced resistance to mRNA booster vaccinee sera in BA.2.75.2.</p><p id="P11">The pattern of neutralization resistance was similar for the BA.1-wave hospitalized COVID-19 patient sera. Introduction of the N460K and R346T/N460K mutations into BA.4.5 strongly reduced neutralization sensitivity by 2.2-fold (p &lt; 0.01) and 4.9-fold (p &lt; 0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3C</xref>). Further, introduction of the R346T/F486S mutations into BA.2.75 reduced neutralization sensitivity by 4.0-fold (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3D</xref>).

Further, while the single mutants had no effect, introduction of the R346T/K444T and R346T/N658S mutations slightly enhanced mean syncytia size by 1.4-fold (p &lt; 0.001) and 1.3-fold (p &lt;0.05) over BA.4/5, potentially indicating a synergistic effect likely contributed by R346T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). Additionally, while the BA.2.75.2 variant exhibited only modestly enhanced syncytia formation over BA.2.75, i.e., 33.2% (p &lt; 0.0001), the introduction of the F486S or R346T/F486S mutations into BA.2.75 enhanced mean syncytia size by 33.8% (p &lt; 0.0001) and 58.1% (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively, suggesting a critical role of F486S in promoting fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-D</xref>).

Remarkably, the S1/S ratio for almost all mutants examined, except the R346T mutation, was decreased compared to the BA.4/5 subvariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), suggesting an enhanced S1 shedding in these BA.4/5 derived mutants, which is consistent with increased fusion. For BA.2.75-derived mutants, the impacts on S2/S and S1/S ratios were fairly modest, with most exhibiting reductions relative to the parental BA.2.75, consistent with the more modest impact on cell-cell fusion of these variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Notably, the introduction of the F486S mutation increased the S2/S ratio by 1.2-fold but had no effect on S1/S ratio compared to BA.2.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structural modeling reveals mechanism of mutation-mediated antibody evasion and alteration in receptor utilization</title><p id="P17">To further understand the functional impact of the mutations in these Omicron subvariants, we performed homology modeling-based structural analyses. R346 and K444 are located outside of SARS-CoV2 receptor binding motif (RBM) and are within the epitope of class III neutralizing antibodies. Structural analysis indicated an interference of antibody recognition introduced by R346S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and K444T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), where hydrogen bonds and a salt-bridge can be abolished. In contrast, F486 is located within the RBM and is a key residue for binding to both ACE2 receptor and neutralizing antibodies; F486 interacts hydrophobically with M82 and Y83 on ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), whereas the F486S mutation negatively impacts the interaction with ACE2, as well as binding by some monoclonal antibodies in class I and III categories. Further structural analysis showed that residue D1199 is located in the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain on a solvent-accessible surface close to the transmembrane domain or membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Electrostatic surface potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> <bold>inset</bold>) of this region reveals a strong negative surface charge, which repulses the negatively charged membrane and could help keep the spike in an up-right position. However, the D1199N mutation in the S2 subunit would reduce the electrostatic repulsion, resulting in a more tilted spike and rendering its less efficient processing and receptor utilization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">We examined the neutralization resistance, fusogencitiy, and S processing of the emerging BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their lineage-defining mutations. All of these subvariants exhibit some degree of enhanced neutralization resistance over their parental BA.4/5 or BA.2.75.2 subvariants, with BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2 exhibiting the strongest resistance. Notably, this pattern is consistent for sera collected from HCWs following a homologous mRNA booster vaccination, from BA.1-wave hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as well as from BA.4/5-wave SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 positive first responders and household contacts. Critically, the neutralization resistance of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 appears to be driven largely by their N460K mutation, while the neutralization resistance of BA.2.75.2 variant is largely determined by the F486S mutation. Additionally, we provide evidence that the N460K and F486S mutations dictate the enhanced fusogenicity and S processing in their respective subvariants, with the D1199N mutation negatively modulating the fusogenicity of the BA.2.75.2 subvariant. Structural modeling and additional analyses revealed crucial roles of residues R436, K444 and F486 in antibody recognition and the potential mechanism of immune evasion through R436S, K444T and F486S mutations present in Omicron subvariants. Intriguingly, our structural analyses also suggest that D1199N mutation located in the HR2 region of S2 could alter the spike position in either an upright or a tilted status by reducing repulsion to the cellular membrane. A tilted spike with less efficient processing and receptor utilization could explain the reduced fusogenicity observed in D1199N-bearing mutations.</p><p id="P19">The neutralization resistance of the BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2 variants has concerning implications for the persistence of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. The strong resistance of these variants to neutralization by patient sera, regardless of the immunogen — mRNA vaccination, BA.1 infection, or BA.4/5 infection — is particularly striking. This finding may indicate selection for immune evasion of even broadly neutralizing antibodies induced by multiple vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infections, as is now common in the population. In particular, the strong evasion of BA.4/5 infection-induced sera is concerning, as the recently recommended bivalent mRNA vaccine boosters contain BA.4/5 S along with the prototype. This possibility, together with the emergence of more diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants necessitates the development of more broadly active, even pan-coronavirus, COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Su et al., 2022a</xref>). As circulating SARS-CoV-2 diversifies, the ability to vaccinate against dominant circulating variants may be even more compromised. Hence, examination of the efficacy of bivalent mRNA vaccines against emerging variants is critical to control and end the global pandemic.</p><p id="P20">In addition to changing the neutralization resistance, these new Omicron subvariants also affect the fusogenicity of the S proteins. Similar to our previous finding that BA.4/5 and BA.2.75 exhibit increased fusion capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Qu et al., 2022a</xref>), here we also observed increased cell-cell fusion in several new Omicron subvariants compared to their respective parental subvariants, BA.4/5 or BA.2.75. These data may together indicate a continuing shift towards more efficient transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) utilization to allow for plasma membrane-mediated viral fusion and entry pathway. Consistent with this notion, we observed an increased furin-cleavage efficiency in several S proteins, especially BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 subvariants, which could improve TMPRSS2 utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mykytyn et al., 2021</xref>). This is concerning, because previously it has been shown that the shift in entry pathway from TMPRSS2-mediated plasma membrane fusion used by the prototype SARS-CoV-2 towards cathepsin B/L-mediated endosomal entry observed in the Omicron clade is associated with reduced lung tropism, increased nasopharyngeal tropism, and reduced pathogenicity of the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">McMahan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Meng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mykytyn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shuai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>).

Examination of tissue tropism and pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> for these and future emerging Omicron subvariants is critical to tailor appropriate public health responses.</p><p id="P21">In this work, we observed altered S processing and fusogenicity in Omicron subvariants. Notably, we found that many mutations examined, including N460K, N658S, and F486S, enhance S processing, as evidenced by increased S2/S ratios in viral producer cells. However, they fail to enhance, and in most cases reduce, the S1/S ratios in virus producer cells. This may indicate that the mutations likely destabilize the S1-S2 interaction and trimer conformation, consistent with increased cell-cell fusion and likely resulting enhanced S1 shedding. Intriguingly, we found that the D1199N mutation reduced S-mediated fusion and S processing, which could suggest that this mutation emerged to compensate for alterations in S functionality introduced by the F486S mutation. Further structural analyses on the impact of these key residues on S trimer conformation are needed to determine if these immune escape mutants are negatively impacting S functionality — potentially limiting the fitness of further immune escape mutations to be introduced.</p><p id="P22">The perpetual emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced immune escape continues to threaten public health. Monitoring the immune escape of emerging variants will be critical to improving mRNA vaccine reformulation, assessing new broader coronavirus vaccine candidates, as well as directing ongoing public health measures. Further, emerging variants must be monitored closely for any indication of selective pressure in enhancing lung tropism and potentially pathogenicity to ensure that any highly transmissible and more pathogenic variants are better and more quickly contained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Samples and Patient Information</title><p id="P23">Sera samples were collected from HCWs at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio with approval from an institutional review board (Gordon et al.)
