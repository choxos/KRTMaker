A defining feature of cilia is that they are evolutionarily ancient yet not universally conserved. In this study we have used the resulting presence and absence pattern in the genomes of diverse eukaryotes to identify a set of 386 human genes associated with cilium assembly or motility. Comprehensive tissue-specific RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mutant analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> revealed signature ciliary defects for 70-80% of novel genes, a percentage similar to that for known genes within the cluster. Further characterization identified different phenotypic classes, including a set of genes related to the cartwheel component Bld10/Cep135 and two highly conserved regulators of cilium biogenesis. We believe this dataset to define the core set of genes required for cilium assembly and motility across eukaryotes, an invaluable resource for future studies of cilium biology and associated disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Centrioles</kwd><kwd>Cilia</kwd><kwd>Ciliogenesis</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic profiling</kwd><kwd>Caenorhabditis elegans</kwd><kwd>Drosophila melanogaster</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The highly stereotypical architecture of cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), terms often used interchangeably, can be found in all branches of the eukaryotic tree of life, albeit not in every species. Indeed, the number of cilia per cell was the defining characteristic to divide eukaryotes into two superclades, unikonts (literally: single flagellum) and bikonts (two) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cavalier-Smith, 2002</xref>). Unikonts comprise the amoebozoa and opisthokonta (posterior flagellum), a clade that contains metazoa, fungi and choanoflagellates, while bikonts comprise the remaining clades. Unikonts typically have only one cilium and associated basal body positioned at the posterior end of the cell, whereas bikonts have two, a younger, anterior, cilium and an older, posterior, cilium. Which of the two configurations represents the ancestral state is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Roger and Simpson, 2009</xref>), but what is clear is that the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes harbored both centrioles and cilia, while centriole-organized centrosomes appear to be a much later opisthokont or metazoan innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Azimzadeh, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Cilia perform both sensory and motile functions. Ciliary motility is used to propel cells through fluid, as in the case of the flagellum of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> or vertebrate sperm, or fluid over the surface of the cell, as in the case of multiciliated epithelia of the vertebrate lung or oviduct. Ciliary motility usually involves dynein motor-mediated ciliary bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R146">Viswanadha et al., 2017</xref>), although gliding motility involving ciliary adhesion to the substrate and internal intraflagellar transport (IFT)-mediated transport of attachment sites has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). Projecting from the cell surface and with a greatly enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, cilia are well suited to receive and transduce signals from the extracellular environment, including light, low molecular weight chemicals, proteins, and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Nachury, 2014</xref>). In vertebrates, exclusively non-motile primary cilia are found on the surface of most cell types and are involved not only in the classical senses of vision and olfaction but are also integral to many of the signaling pathways that underlie development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). The manifold functions of cilia in vertebrates are reflected in the pleiotropic nature of human cilium-related disorders or ciliopathies, with clinical manifestations including <italic>situs inversus</italic>, respiratory dysfunction, infertility and hydrocephalus for disorders affecting motile cilia, while disorders affecting non-motile cilia are characterized by defects in neural tube development and limb patterning, cystic kidney, liver and pancreatic diseases, retinal degeneration, anosmia, cognitive defects and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Mitchison and Valente, 2017</xref>). Yet, while the most severe ciliopathies are perinatal lethal, they nevertheless represent only the weak end of the phenotypic spectrum, with complete loss of cilia resulting in embryonic lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Murcia et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P4">During ciliogenesis, centrioles dock either to a vesicle in the cytoplasm that fuses with the plasma membrane creating a ciliary pocket (intracellular pathway) or to the plasma membrane itself (extracellular pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R129">Sorokin, 1962</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Central to this process are the transition fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), which in vertebrates are derived from appendages present at the distal end of mature centrioles. These recruit a kinase, TTBK2, which promotes the removal of inhibitory factors present at the distal end of centrioles and the assembly of ciliary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>). Formation of the outer microtubule doublets of the axoneme occurs by direct extension of centriolar microtubules, while the central pair of microtubules present in motile cilia forms <italic>de novo</italic> distal to the basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">O’Toole et al., 2003</xref>). Motile cilia furthermore have multiple accessory structures decorating the axoneme (nexins, outer and inner dynein arms), which mediate ciliary bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ishikawa, 2017</xref>). Separating the basal body from the cilium proper is the transition zone, an elaborate structure characterized by Y-links connecting axonemal microtubules to the ciliary membrane. The transition zone serves to restrict protein access, establishing the cilium as a distinct cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). Extension of the axoneme within this compartment requires microtubule motor-driven intraflagellar transport (IFT) delivering material to the ciliary tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Not all aspects of ciliogenesis are presently equally well understood. This applies in particular to the early steps involving docking of centrioles to the plasma membrane and initiation of transition zone assembly/axoneme extension. We have an increasingly detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">Shakya and Westlake, 2021</xref>) in vertebrates. Yet, the degree to which these are relevant to the less well studied extracellular pathway is unclear, with key players apparently dispensable in this context and not conserved beyond metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R132">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>). The role of centriolar appendages is also far from universal, with appendages seemingly lacking in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Gottardo et al., 2015</xref>), without impairing basal body docking and initiation of ciliogenesis in these species. It is possible that different species have evolved different mechanisms for the same biological challenge. Alternatively, we do not yet possess the full set of conserved genes involved in the early steps of ciliogenesis. Missing genes likely also account for some of the still significant number of ciliopathy cases for which the causative genes have yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Mitchison and Valente, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Our present compendium of ciliogenesis components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R144">Vasquez et al., 2021</xref>) derives from a variety of different sources, including proteomics of isolated cilia in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R127">Smith et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R154">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) and genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>), which led to the identification of much of the machinery for ciliary motility and IFT. Basal body and transition zone components in part have also been identified by proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>), but more commonly as the causative genes in human ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Comprehensive genomewide RNAi or mutant screens have as yet not been carried out except in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R150">Wheway et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, targeted approaches have been employed to enrich for ciliary genes. Comparative genomics in particular has proven very fruitful. Two landmark studies published in 2004 took advantage of the first fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes to define ciliary genes by simple subtractive analysis (i.e. ciliated vs. non-ciliated species), identifying key components of the ciliary trafficking machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Li et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, the availability of increasing numbers of sequenced genomes have enabled more sophisticated phylogenetic profiling analyses, using cooccurrence patterns across evolution to predict genes with a common function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Dey and Meyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Pellegrini et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we conducted a wider phylogenetic profiling approach, utilizing 147 genomes representing all major phyla of the eukaryotic tree to define a cluster of 386 human genes associated with the presence of cilia, including most of the known players involved in key steps of centriole assembly, cilium biogenesis and motility, as well as another 152 genes that have so far not been functionally characterized. Systematic RNAi-based analysis of novel genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as more targeted mutant analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that most if not all of these genes are likely cilium-related, with our downstream characterization focusing on a set of genes involved in early steps of the ciliogenesis pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of a ciliary cluster using a refined phylogenetic profiling approach</title><p id="P7">The present study emerged from a long-standing interest in the lab in the molecular mechanisms underlying centriole assembly and function in ciliogenesis, using the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Dammermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Dammermann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Dobbelaere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Serwas et al., 2017</xref>). Given the highly conserved nature of centrioles and cilia, we hypothesized that the early stages of ciliogenesis including centriole to basal body conversion and initiation of axoneme extension must also be conserved across eukaryotes. To identify candidate genes potentially involved in these processes we decided to apply a refined phylogenetic profiling approach. The original landmark studies had demonstrated the utility of comparative genomics approaches to identify ciliary genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Avidor-Reiss <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, we noted that certain proteins such as the core centriolar components CENPJ/SAS-4, STIL/SAS-5/Ana2 and SASS6 tend to be missed in orthology inferences due to their high degree of sequence divergence making them drop below significance thresholds in rapidly evolving species such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Hodges et al., 2010</xref>). In setting out to generate our phylogenetic profiles we therefore chose a deliberately low BLASTp sequence similarity cutoff of 0.1, with bidirectional best match as a simple but robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>) method to infer orthology. We further decided to use the human proteome as the starting point for our analysis, not only because it is the best annotated, but also because vertebrates display a lower rate of sequence divergence compared to other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Douzery et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Raible et al., 2005</xref>). Phylogenetic profiling approaches have grown increasingly complex, with recent studies aimed at identifying ciliary genes incorporating information on the ciliary status of species, their evolutionary relationship and/or training sets of verified ciliary genes, as well as iterative agglomerative clustering to identify orthogroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Nevers et al., 2017</xref>). We here opted instead for a simple hierarchical clustering approach, incorporating no information beyond the presence/absence pattern computed for each of the 21.732 human protein coding genes across the genomes of 147 diverse eukaryotes representing the different branches of the eukaryotic tree, as well as 12 prokaryotic species (9 archaea, 3 bacteria) as outgroups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1A</xref>). In selecting genomes, care was taken to avoid over-representing certain branches of the tree and to exclude incompletely sequenced/annotated genomes that would create false negatives in the phylogenetic analysis. Visual inspection of the clustering output revealed a set of 386 genes whose inheritance pattern was clearly distinct from that of other highly conserved genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1B</xref>). Further analysis showed this set of genes to comprise key centriolar and ciliary genes, and their presence and absence pattern across eukaryotes to reflect the presence and absence of cilia in those species (see below). Such a single ciliary cluster had not been observed in previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Dey <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Nevers <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). We therefore sought to confirm the robustness of our analysis by reducing the number of species representing each branch of the tree by 25%, 50% and 75%. A clear ciliary cluster could still be identified in all cases, although the percentage of cluster genes remaining dropped below 80% with the most aggressive perturbation (277/386 genes when using 42 genomes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This is in line with published reports of diminishing returns in phylogenetic profiling approaches &gt;100 genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">Škunca and Dessimoz, 2015</xref>). We conclude that our phylogenetic profiling approach robustly identifies a set of genes putatively linked to cilia.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>In silico</italic> characterization of the ciliary phylogenetic cluster</title><p id="P8">We next set out to examine the 386 genes in the cluster by performing a comprehensive literature and database analysis, including any information on their putative orthologs in non-vertebrate experimental models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2A</xref>). We classified each gene based on its level of functional characterization overall and any previously reported link to cilia on a scale of 0-3 (0 no information, 1 some indication of centriole/cilium-related function, 2 confirmed function, 3 clearly established molecular mechanism). We further set out to provide a short description of its proposed function, as well as any potential or confirmed ciliopathy association. At time of writing, 234 of the 386 genes in the cluster had a reported function in cilium assembly or motility (i.e. with a score of 2 or above), with the other 152 genes as yet functionally uncharacterized or not linked to cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). How comprehensive is this list for known ciliary complexes and structures? As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, more than 50% and in many cases nearer 100% of components reported to be associated with basal bodies (including centriolar and transition zone components), cilium assembly (IFT and BBS components) and motility (inner and outer dynein arm components and dynein assembly factors, nexins, N-DRC, radial spoke and central apparatus components and the only recently identified microtubule inner proteins (MIPs)) can be found in the cluster, indicating essentially complete coverage of core components. Notably missing are components linked to centrosomes (PCM and centriolar satellites), sub-distal appendages of centrioles and ciliary membrane trafficking, in line with the proposed recent evolutionary origin of centrosomes and the intracellular pathway of ciliogenesis discussed above (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2B</xref>). A comparison of the present cluster with the original comparative genomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Avidor-Reiss <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and more recent refined phylogenetic profiling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Dey <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Nevers <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) revealed considerable overlap, but also components unique to one or other type of study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2C</xref>). The enrichment of known ciliary components in the present study suggests our approach is similarly if not more effective at identifying <italic>bona fide</italic> components compared to other recent phylogenetic profiling approaches, although a direct comparison is complicated by the inclusion of known components as ‘seeds’ in the latter analyses.</p><p id="P9">Of the 386 genes in the ciliary cluster, all but one can be found in two or more of the 6 major eukaryotic groups other than unikonts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> (counting cryptophytes and haptophytes and disicristates and excavates each as one group). All genes therefore likely originate in the ancestral eukaryote and may have formed part of the original complement to assemble motile cilia. As discussed by David Mitchell in his 2016 review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Mitchell, 2016</xref>), diversification into modern organisms has involved not only acquisition of new features but also loss of existing ones, including part or all of the machinery to form cilia. Within the species represented in our analysis, cilia can be inferred to have been lost 13 times independently of each other over the course of evolution (4x in opisthokonts, 1x in amoebozoa, 3x in archaeplastidae, 2x in alveolates, 3x in stramenopiles, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1A</xref>), which helps explain the clear definition of the ciliary cluster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>. Clustering species based on the major ciliary subcomplexes within the cluster reveals 7 other patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2C</xref>). The machinery for ciliary motility but not cilia themselves has been entirely lost twice (once in nematodes, once in the arthropod <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>) and once in part (in the crustacean <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic>). These and other losses (e.g. of BBSome components in ciliated fungi) give rise to the grouping of genes functioning together in ciliary subcomplexes seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and can be used to predict the function of known genes based purely on their pattern of conservation with a high degree of accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2D</xref>). For the 152 novel candidate genes within the cluster, ~2/3 can be assigned as putative ciliary assembly or motility genes, while for the remaining 1/3 the phylogenetic footprint is insufficient to make a confident prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2D</xref>). But is there any experimental evidence for a ciliary function for these genes? Indeed, there is. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, candidate genes have been identified in large scale proteomic, expression and localization screens performed in different experimental models, albeit unsurprisingly (given that those selfsame screens were used to isolate and characterize ciliary genes) at a lower rate than known genes within the cluster (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Functional analysis of cluster genes reveals signature ciliary phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p id="P10">Based on our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis we were confident that within this cluster we had a set of genes highly enriched in key players in cilium assembly and motility. To test whether candidate genes indeed have a cilium-related function, we performed a comprehensive characterization by tissue-specific RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mutant analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an attractive experimental model for such questions in that it possesses multiple types of cilia, including motile sperm flagella that have been reported to form in an IFT-independent manner in the cytoplasm, as well as sensory cilia that form in the canonical, IFT-dependent manner in olfactory and mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Han et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Jana et al., 2016</xref>). Candidate genes can therefore be easily classified into genes required for general and compartmentalized cilium biogenesis and cilium motility. Using the GAL4-UAS system to deplete each candidate gene in the male germline (scoring male fertility), sensory neurons (assessing coordination in the negative geotaxis assay) and the whole animal (testing for nonspecific, pleiotropic phenotypes), we compared the resultant phenotypes to those for known ciliary genes within the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, centriolar and ciliary transition zone components presented moderately strong phenotypes in both tissues, consistent with their role in both canonical and compartmentalized cilium biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Basiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Jana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R145">Vieillard et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, IFT components presented strong phenotypes almost exclusively in neurons, confirming and generalizing their reported role specifically in compartmentalized cilium biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Han <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). This was also true for the IFT-associated BBSome, not previously functionally characterized in the fly, although phenotypes here were generally weak. In contrast, depletion of axonemal dyneins with the exception of certain outer arm dyneins strongly affected male fertility. Gravitaxis was also frequently perturbed, reflecting the role of dynein activity in mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R157">Zur Lage et al., 2019</xref>). In total 88% of known ciliary genes within the cluster presented significant phenotypes in neurons, sperm or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3A</xref>). Remarkably, this was true also for 54 of 69 novel genes (78%). Depleting candidate genes in the whole animal tended to reveal no additional phenotypes, ruling out broader cellular functions. Given the limitations of the assays employed in this primary screen we conclude that most if not all novel candidate genes are indeed cilium-linked.</p><p id="P11">To confirm and extend our findings we turned to <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a complementary experimental model. Unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses exclusively non-motile cilia, present in post-mitotic sensory neurons, where they mediate the perception of chemosensory and mechanosensory stimuli. Compromised ciliary function leads to defects in complex behaviors such as chemotaxis, foraging and male mating. However, critically, cilia are dispensable for viability and fertility, allowing mutants to be propagated in their homozygous state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate the potential role of candidate genes in cilium assembly, we took advantage of the dye-fill assay as a simple and robust method to assess cilium structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Hedgecock et al., 1985</xref>). This assay is based on incubating worms with dilute solutions of the lipophilic dye DiI. In wild-type, this dye is taken up by a subset of neurons (12 amphid neurons in the head, 4 phasmid neurons in the tail) through their exposed ciliary endings and accumulates in their cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Defects in cilium assembly result in impaired dye-filling, which can be easily scored under the fluorescence microscope. For known ciliary genes within the cluster, the dye-fill assay revealed significant defects for 60 of 68 genes (88%), aided by the low animal to animal variability in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, with IFT mutants presenting stronger phenotypes than those affecting the transition zone (centriolar genes cannot be assayed given their essential role in embryonic development) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F, G</xref>). Remarkably, 26 of 37 candidate genes (70%) likewise presented a dye-fill phenotype. Phenotypes were generally weak, reflecting the fact that stronger, dye-fill null mutants have been previously identified in exhaustive large-scale screens using this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Perkins <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>). With ecdysozoa and particularly nematodes having experienced widespread gene-loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Guijarro-Clarke et al., 2020</xref>), including within the ciliary cluster, not all 386 genes could be assayed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our results are, however, consistent with our hypothesis that essentially all cluster genes function in some aspect of cilium assembly or motility.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Secondary analysis identifies candidate genes involved in the early stages of ciliogenesis</title><p id="P12">Although our primary screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> allowed the identification and general classification of candidate genes, the precise nature of the process disrupted in each case remained to be determined. Thus, defects in male fertility could arise from a lack of sperm flagella or lack of sperm motility. Similarly, neuronal defects could arise from a lack of cilia or lack of mechanosensory function. To classify novel ciliary genes according to their function and identify candidates for further study we employed a set of secondary assays for both sperm and neuronal cilia, comparing their depletion phenotypes to those for representatives of the various functional classes. For any gene scoring significantly in the coordination assays as well as those chosen for further characterization based on their spermatogenesis phenotype, the chordotonal organs responsible for proprioception located in the animals’ legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>) were dissected and examined by DIC microscopy, as well as by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to markers for the apical ciliary membrane (NompC) and basal bodies (Sas-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Dobbelaere <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Chordotonal organs are made up of multiple scolopidia, each of which contains a pair of ciliated nerve endings ensheathed by a glial cell and attached with their ciliary tips to the cuticle via a cap cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Kernan, 2007</xref>). We found defects in cilium biogenesis to manifest themselves in different ways, with depletion of centriole biogenesis and IFT components resulting in the total absence or reduced numbers of cilia, while depletion of other components yielded more subtle defects including shorter (as assessed by the position of the ciliary dilation) or morphologically abnormal cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Depletion of candidate genes primarily resulted in the latter type of defect, with 8 of 36 genes examined displaying shortened or abnormal cilia (Selected examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>, quantitation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3B</xref>). Supernumerary cilia, formed by conversion of daughter centrioles into mothers, a phenotype associated with depletion of Centrobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Gottardo <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), were not observed for any candidate gene.</p><p id="P13">For any gene scoring significantly in the male fertility assay as well as those chosen for further characterization based on their neuronal phenotype, the process of spermatogenesis was examined in two ways. First, testes were dissected, fixed and stained to visualize DNA and the actin cytoskeleton. This allowed us to monitor the different stages of sperm differentiation using nuclear morphology, as well as the formation of actin cones during individualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Second, we dissected the seminal vesicle where mature sperm are stored and filmed the movement of sperm tails using dark field microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Examining known ciliary genes, we found that centriolar and transition zone components gave the strongest phenotypes, arresting sperm morphogenesis at early stages of differentiation, whereas motility genes only affected later stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). Interestingly, sperm found in the seminal vesicle was generally found to be at least partly motile, with defects in ciliary motility primarily manifesting themselves in an empty seminal vesicle as sperm fail to move from the testes to this storage organ. Depletion of candidate genes resulted in a wide spectrum of phenotypes, with some genes resulting in defects as early as the early spermatid stage, similar to Sas4 and CEP290, while others progressed as far as the individualization stage. Overall, 15 of 18 genes examined yielded significant phenotypes in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref>, quantitation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In total, 19 of 37 genes (51%) examined based on their primary screen phenotype presented clear defects in either neurons or sperm.

TEX9 has previously been localized to centriolar satellites and the ciliary base in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Nevers <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), but remains functionally uncharacterized. CCDC6 has an extensive literature as a recurrent fusion partner for the oncogenic tyrosine kinases ROS1 and RET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cerrato et al., 2018</xref>), yet itself remains entirely uncharacterized, although interestingly it was reported amongst the interactors in pulldowns of the IFT-B component Cluap1/IFT38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Beyer et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, CABLES1 has been reported to interact with CDK5 and c-ABL and linked to control of cell proliferation and/or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R148">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R156">Zukerberg et al., 2000</xref>), with no apparent connection to centrosomes or cilia. Given the severity of the neuronal and spermatogenesis phenotypes, ultrastructural analysis was performed on RNAi-depleted animals (and in the case of CABLES1 also deletion mutants) for all three candidate genes. In the case of neuronal cilia, we observed a general disorganization of ciliary tips, with missing axonemal doublet microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). More striking was the phenotype in sperm, where the central pair of microtubules was frequently missing, while the outer microtubule doublets were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Such a phenotype has hitherto been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> only for a single gene, the centriolar cartwheel component Bld10/CEP135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2012</xref>). A re-examination of CEP135 by RNAi and mutant analysis confirmed these earlier observations but also revealed defects in mechanosensation and ciliary ultrastructure in chordotonal neurons, similar to CABLES1 and CCDC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We should note that the latter finding stands in contrast to initial reports on this gene in the fly which reported no apparent defects in coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Mottier-Pavie and Megraw, 2009</xref>), which we attribute to the use of a stronger loss of function mutant than in the original work.</p><p id="P16">This phenotypic similarity to CEP135 prompted us to examine the localization of our novel components in the fly, with GFP transgenic fusions expressed under the general Ubq promoter. Remarkably, GFP fusions for both TEX9 and CCDC6, like CEP135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R136">Tian et al., 2021</xref>), localized to the center of the centriole barrel marked by Ana1, but extending further along the length of the extended spermatocyte basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The third protein, CABLES1, also localized to spermatocyte basal bodies, albeit much more weakly, precluding more detailed analysis. No localization was observed to centrosome-organizing centrioles elsewhere in the fly. Instead, all three proteins were recruited as centrioles convert into basal bodies during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). In the course of our studies we came across one other known ciliary cluster gene, CEP104, which shared some of the phenotypic features of the above-named components. Ultrastructural analysis of both RNAi-depleted and mutant animals revealed the same signature ciliary defects in sperm and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). CEP104 in vertebrates and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> has been shown to be a microtubule plus-end tracking protein that translocates during ciliogenesis from the distal end of centrioles to the ciliary tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Satish Tammana et al., 2013</xref>). Cep104 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> shares this localization, forming a central focus at the distal end of sperm basal bodies that co-localizes with the most distal populations of CCDC6 and TEX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We then have four (with CABLES1 potentially five) components that share a localization to the core of basal bodies, with CEP135 at the proximal end and CEP104 at the distal end, and function in ciliogenesis, particularly in formation of the central pair and organization of ciliary tips. We therefore propose that these components form part of a common ciliogenesis pathway with CEP135 at its base. Consistent with such a pathway, loss of CEP135 is independent of CABLES1, CCDC6 and TEX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>), but strongly affects the localization of all other components without affecting centriole assembly <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CFAP97D1 as part of a family of CFAP97 domain-containing proteins required for axoneme assembly/stability</title><p id="P18">CG14551/CFAP97D1 drew our attention due to its strong phenotype specifically in neurons.

CFAP97D1 in mice has been found to be required for sperm flagellar axoneme integrity and male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Oura et al., 2020</xref>), while its paralog CFAP97D2 remains uncharacterized.

It was then surprising to see a phenotype for CFAP97D1 exclusively in neurons. Further characterization including by mutant analysis confirmed this specificity. Ultrastructural analysis of chordotonal cilia revealed broken axonemes and missing axonemal microtubule doublets, particularly towards the ciliary tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), a phenotype reminiscent to what has been observed for sperm flagella with vertebrate CFAP97D1 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hemingway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Oura <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R130">Soulavie <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).

Such a localization is consistent with the proposed function of CFAP97 domain-containing proteins in cilium elongation/stability. Our data suggests that this function is not specific to motile cilia/flagella. Consistent with this, the Human Protein Atlas (proteinatlas.org, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R141">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>)) notes that while CFAP97D1 is testis specific, CFAP97D2 is more broadly expressed in ciliated tissues, including those bearing exclusively non-motile cilia such as the pancreas, while CFAP97 is essentially ubiquitous.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Unique role for CFAP299 in ciliary membrane deposition and ciliogenesis</title><p id="P19">CG8138/CFAP299 along with CG14013, CG14017 and CG3528 is one of four <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs of vertebrate C4orf22/CFAP299 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), a largely uncharacterized protein reported to be testis-enriched and tentatively linked to spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Li et al., 2019a</xref>), but according to the Human Protein Atlas (proteinatlas.org, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R141">Uhlén <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>)) also expressed in other ciliated tissues including the lung and oviduct. CG8138 initially presented with a strong phenotype in male fertility in the primary and secondary screen. Ultrastructural analysis of both RNAi-depleted and mutant animals revealed what to our knowledge is a unique and unprecedented phenotype: a seemingly intact flagellar axoneme but a total failure of membrane deposition to complete sperm individualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). As described above, <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis is highly unusual in that flagella form in an IFT-independent manner in the cytoplasm and are then extruded in a process reminiscent of what is believed to occur in the malarial parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Han <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">Sinden et al., 1976</xref>). The proteins responsible for axoneme elongation in the cytoplasm, whether unique to that context or shared with canonical compartmentalized ciliogenesis, are not known. Tantalizingly, CFAP299 is also conserved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, yet its wider phylogenetic distribution, including in humans, suggest a function also in canonical ciliogenesis. Indeed, CG8138/CFAP299 mutant animals also presented severe defects in chordotonal neurons, with highly aberrant axonemes lacking nine-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). CG8138 shares extensive homology with its paralogs CG14013, CG14017 and CG3528, also putatively expressed in neurons and sperm, raising the possibility of functional redundancy. Consistent with this, weaker phenotypes were also observed for two other more distantly related paralogs CG14013 and CG3528 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3A</xref>).

MAPK15 (also known as ERK7 or 8) is an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase, atypical in the sense that it does not function as part of a classical three-tiered MAPKKK–MAPKK–MAP kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Coulombe and Meloche, 2007</xref>). Originally linked to cellular homeostasis and the maintenance of genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Deniz et al., 2022</xref>), MAPK15 was more recently found to also regulate ciliogenesis by promoting the apical migration of basal bodies in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, reportedly by phosphorylating the actin regulator CapZIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Miyatake et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, putative <italic>mapk-15</italic> loss of function mutations were found to perturb neuronal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">McLachlan et al., 2018</xref>) but also ciliary architecture as well as the localization of many ciliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Kazatskaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Piasecki et al., 2017</xref>). Ciliogenesis was also reported to be affected in human RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Kazatskaya <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). With the kinase localizing to the ciliary base, MAPK-15 was proposed to act in a gating capacity to regulate ciliary trafficking and thereby ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Kazatskaya <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P21">What caught our attention is that MAPK-15 is one of only 14 genes universally conserved in ciliated species and lost in non-ciliated ones, a remarkably short list that also includes the core centriolar structural components SASS6 and CENPJ/SAS-4, suggesting a central role in cilium biogenesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2D</xref>). Consistent with this, MAPK15 scored strongly in the primary and secondary screens in the fly as well as in the worm. Given that available mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are only partial gene deletions, a complete knockout was generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. This mutant presented an even stronger phenotype (with an average of 4.3 and 0.3 dye-filled neurons in amphids and phasmids, respectively, compared to 6.9 and 0.4 for the original mutant), with cilium length and dendrite extension (indicative of transition zone dysfunction in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Schouteden et al., 2015</xref>)) both strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis revealed that <italic>mapk-15</italic> null mutants display severe defects in transition zone organization and axoneme elongation, with additional distortions of the periciliary membrane previously noted for loss of the microtubule organizing center at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Garbrecht et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C-E</xref>). This combination of phenotypes in the worm is remarkable in that IFT mutants do not affect transition zone organization, while loss of transition structures barely affects cilium elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Schouteden <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>). Indeed, no other previously characterized <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene shares this dual phenotype. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> phenotype is likewise remarkable: severe defects in both sperm and neuronal axoneme elongation and structural integrity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, B</xref>). Defects in flagellar morphogenesis in particular are telling, given that this process is IFT-independent in the fly. MAPK15 thus clearly functions in IFT-independent step in axoneme elongation, consistent with its conservation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, which entirely lacks IFT components. MAPK15 has previously been reported to localize to the (acentriolar) ciliary base in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and basal bodies in vertebrates, as well as to the periciliary membrane compartment in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Kazatskaya <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). We could confirm those observations for the worm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>) and extend them to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where MAPK15 co-localized with the core centriolar component Sas4 to basal bodies in both chordotonal neurons and sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C, D</xref>). What is worth noting, however, is that MAPK15 does not localize to centrioles elsewhere in the worm or fly. Instead, MAPK15 is recruited to basal bodies at a time comparable to the expression of the very first ciliary components (1.5-fold stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Serwas <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>), meiosis I in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Basiri <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). In summary, then, what MAPK15 represents is a universally conserved regulator that is recruited at the onset of ciliogenesis to initiate the assembly of otherwise largely independent ciliary structures (the ciliary transition zone and axoneme).</p><p id="P22">ELMOD1-3, represented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> by a single ortholog, ELMOD/ELMD-1, are part of a family of ELMO (Engulfment and cell motility) domain-containing proteins, named after its founding member CED-12/ELMO1, which acts to promote apoptotic cell engulfment by activating CED-10/Rac1 GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R152">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R155">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, ELMOD family members are thought to act as ARF/ARL GAPs, with broad cellular effects, including on the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Li et al., 2019b</xref>). All three vertebrate ELMOD proteins have recently been localized to basal bodies and linked to ciliogenesis, albeit with seemingly opposing effects: While loss of ELMOD1 and 3 reduced ciliation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, loss of ELMOD2 actually resulted in an increase, with those cilia displaying abnormal morphology, including apparent splaying of axonemes and ciliary rootlet defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R139">Turn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R140">Turn et al., 2021</xref>) (ultrastructural analysis has so far not been performed). Common to all three perturbations is a mislocalization of ciliary proteins, suggesting ciliary trafficking is at least partly responsible for the observed defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R139">Turn <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R140">Turn <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In our primary and secondary screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELMOD presented with strong phenotypes in both sperm and neurons and rather less of a phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the latter result was based on a nonsense mutant of uncertain consequence (<italic>elmd-1(gk386113)</italic>, Trp24Ter, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R135">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>)). Similarly weak phenotypes were reported recently for another mutant, <italic>elmd-1(syb630)</italic>, a partial gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Cevik et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore obtained a full gene deletion, which yielded a much stronger phenotype (with an average of 4.9 and 0.5 dye-filled neurons in amphids and phasmids, respectively, compared to 10.4 and 3.8 for the original mutant) and was used for further analysis. Remarkably, in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELMOD presented phenotypes nearly indistinguishable from MAPK15. Thus, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> both cilium and dendrite lengths were much reduced, with axonemal, transition zone and periciliary membrane compartment defects matching those of MAPK15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-E</xref>). Likewise, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELMOD depletion led to defects in axoneme elongation and structural integrity in both sperm and chordotonal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, B</xref>). ELMOD and MAPK15 localization was also very similar if not quite identical: In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both proteins localize to basal bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C, D</xref>), while in <italic>C. elegans</italic> both display a dual localization to the ciliary base as well as the periciliary membrane compartment, although here the domain occupied by ELMOD is more extensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). Finally, neither protein localizes to centrioles, with both being recruited to basal bodies early in ciliogenesis with near-identical timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, S2C</xref>). These similarities led us to posit that these proteins may function in the same molecular pathway. Consistent with this, <italic>elmd-1;mapk-15</italic> double mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> presented a phenotype no more severe than that of either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>). Finally, we sought to investigate whether there were any localization interdependencies between these two ciliary components. We found loss of MAPK-15 to impair proper ciliary targeting of ELMD-1, while MAPK-15 localization was not affected by loss of ELMD-1 (indeed, levels are markedly increased) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref>). Our results therefore indicate that ELMD-1 functions downstream of MAPK-15 in a ciliogenesis program that serves to convert centrosome-organizing centrioles into basal bodies capable of supporting axoneme extension and transition zone assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Cilia in many ways are ideally suited for comparative genomics approaches in that they are evolutionarily ancient yet not universally conserved in all extant species.

The resultant presence and absence pattern for ciliary genes in the genomes of fully sequenced eukaryotes creates a prominent phylogenetic signature that sets them apart from other highly conserved genes. We found that, at least for cilia, a simple but robust phylogenetic profiling approach based on bidirectional best matches and hierarchical clustering outperforms more sophisticated approaches and identifies a single cluster of 386 genes. This cluster includes the vast majority of known players involved in key steps of centriole assembly, cilium biogenesis and motility, as well as a set of novel genes that our functional analysis indicates are likewise associated with different aspects of cilium assembly and motility. We believe this set to constitute the core complement of genes required to assemble motile cilia.

In both experimental models, novel candidate genes scored at a similar frequency to known genes within the cluster, without presenting any significant pleiotropic phenotypes. Given the limitations in sensitivity of the assays employed in our screen we conclude that most if not all candidate genes are indeed cilium-linked. We were unable to assess this for the 64 genes not conserved in either worm or fly. However, the plentiful indications of cilium-related functions from large-scale proteomic, expression and localization approaches give us the confidence to extend this conclusion to the entire set of 152 genes within our cluster. The use of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> as complementary experimental models enabled us to classify novel genes into genes required for cilium biogenesis (the only class conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) or cilium motility, with the former category further subdivided into genes required specifically for compartmentalized cilium biogenesis (scoring in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons only) and those required for cilium biogenesis regardless of context (scoring in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons and sperm).</p><p id="P25">In our downstream characterization we focused on genes required for cilium biogenesis, particularly those involved in the poorly understood early steps surrounding the conversion of centrioles into basal bodies and initiation of transition zone/axoneme assembly. Given the almost total lack of known biogenesis genes conserved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> where this process must of necessity occur in an IFT-independent manner, we were also interested in any genes required for IFT-independent cilium biogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm. The first set of genes comprises the novel basal body components CABLES1, CCDC6 and TEX9. We found these genes to function in a pathway initiated by the cartwheel component Bld10/CEP135 and also involving the microtubule plus-end tracking protein CEP104. CEP135 is notable for being part of a highly conserved centriole and basal body module first identified by the lab of Monica Bettencourt-Dias, also comprising SASS6 and SAS-4/CENPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Carvalho-Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Yet, unlike SASS6 and SAS-4/CENPJ, CEP135 is not required for centriole assembly <italic>per se</italic>, instead playing a role specifically in the formation of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Roque et al., 2012</xref>). We see CABLES1, CCDC6 and TEX9 as part of the same centriole to basal body conversion program. While highly conserved, not all components of this program are present in every ciliated species (by our criteria only CABLES1 and CEP104 are universally conserved, including in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>), nor are they necessarily required in every cellular context within the same organism. We suggest that this reflects an underappreciated variability in basal body and ciliary architecture in different species and different tissues within the same species, building on a common core centriole structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Jana, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Jana <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). A different form of diversification is exemplified by the CFAP97 and CFAP299 family of genes, where multiple paralogs exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates. It is notable that different family members in many cases have different tissue expression patterns, raising the possibility of both redundancy and functional diversification. Further work will be required to establish the degree to which paralogs can functionally replace each other when expressed in the respective mutant context. When considered as a family, both CFAP97 and CFAP299 function in core (i.e. non-IFT-dependent) cilium biogenesis, with phenotypes in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm and neurons, although only CFAP299 is conserved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. As described above, CFAP299 presents a particularly unusual phenotype in sperm, with a failure of membrane deposition around the flagellar axoneme. How this phenotype relates to its function in canonical, compartmentalized cilium biogenesis remains to be established, but it is clear that this is a particularly interesting candidate to follow up on.</p><p id="P26">Finally, the atypical MAP kinase MAPK15 is of interest as a universally conserved master regulator of ciliogenesis, present in all ciliated species and lost in non-ciliated ones. Such a high degree of conservation stands in contrast to the regulation of centriole assembly, which only in metazoans is driven by the polo-like kinase PLK4/ZYG-1, while core centriolar structural components are universal across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Carvalho-Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). At the same time, the loss of MAPK15 in non-ciliated species argues against pleiotropic functions such as have been proposed for this kinase in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Deniz <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These observations speak to a high degree of evolutionary constraint, potentially reflecting multiple targets within the ciliogenesis pathway. We here identify one downstream effector, the putative ARF/ARL GAP ELMOD, which is likewise highly (but not universally) conserved and which displays a near-identical spectrum of phenotypes to MAPK15 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The downstream targets for MAPK15 in ciliogenesis beyond ELMOD are currently unclear. While previous work has linked both MAPK15 and ELMOD to ciliary trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Cevik <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Kazatskaya <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R139">Turn <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R140">Turn <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), this clearly cannot explain their role in IFT-independent cilium biogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm and (in the case of MAPK15) <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. It is also notable that no other <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene to date shares their dual phenotype in transition zone assembly and axoneme extension. With both proteins being recruited at the earliest stages of ciliogenesis as centrioles become basal bodies, we suggest that their role is instead in that initial templating step, similar to the role ascribed to TTBK2, a kinase not clearly linked to ciliogenesis beyond metazoans, in the intracellular pathway of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Goetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, our phylogenetic profiling-based screen has defined what appears to be the core set of genes required for cilium assembly and motility across eukaryotes, a set that includes a substantial number of as yet poorly characterized candidate genes.

To obtain complete deletions, males carrying one element were mated with females carrying a FLP recombinase transgene. Progeny males carrying both the element and FLP recombinase were then mated to females carrying the other element. After 2-3 days, parents were transferred to a new vial and progeny subjected to a 1h heat shock by placing the vials into a 37°C water bath. We subjected the vials to daily 1h heat shocks for another 4 days. Progeny were then raised to adulthood, males collected and crossed to females containing marked balancer chromosomes.

In addition, a number of bacterial and archaeal genomes were included as outgroups. Only completely sequenced and well annotated genomes were chosen by confirming the presence of universally conserved genes. Starting point for our analysis was the human proteome, obtained from UNIPROT on 7 Feb 2014. Datasets were generated by performing a reciprocal BLASTp analysis for each human protein coding gene against the proteomes of each of the 159 genomes in our analysis. The BLAST-algorithm used was NCBI BLAST 2.2.28, build 12 Mar 2013. If a hit was found above the EXPECT threshold of 0.1, the highest scoring protein sequence in this proteome was then run against the human proteome. If this reciprocal BLAST returned a protein of the same GeneID, a reciprocal hit was established for this protein, in that species, represented by a 1 in the output dataset. Otherwise a 0 was reported for this protein-species test. The resulting binary matrix was then used as input for hierarchical clustering in Gene Cluster, using the Euclidean distance metric and average linkage clustering for both genes and species on the entire dataset comprising 21732 human protein coding genes and 159 species. Within the clustering output viewed in Java TreeView a group of genes was identified with a similar phylogenetic inheritance pattern centered around the core centriolar component CENPJ/SAS-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Kirkham et al., 2003</xref>). This cluster appeared quite distinct, such that loosening similarity constraints would only gradually grow the cluster until a final size of 386 genes was reached. As detailed elsewhere in this manuscript, this cluster was highly enriched in known ciliary genes and hence was chosen for further analysis. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we repeated the hierarchical clustering with reduced numbers of species (25%, 50% or 75% fewer), with genomes removed equally from all branches of the eukaryotic tree (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1A</xref>).

We further set out to provide a short description of its proposed function, with broader and more specific classifiers (e.g. Centriole/cilium biogenesis, IFT-A complex), including references to the relevant literature with PubMed identifiers.

The same was done with the sets of genes associated with specific centrosomal/ciliary functional modules, compiled from recent reviews and primary research publications.

Defects were scored for each stage using the following scale: 0 = normal morphology, 1 = weak deviation (occasionally observed in negative controls), 2 = stronger effect but normal morphology also observed, 3 = all or vast majority of nuclei/investment cones for a given stage show aberration, 4 = missing stage. Motility was assessed visually based on the number of motile sperm and frequency of flagellar beat compared to wild-type sperm. Absence of sperm from the seminal vesicle was also noted.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> secondary screen - Analysis of defects in chordotonal neurons by DIC microscopy</title><p id="P49">Chordotonal organ samples were taken from P9 stage male puparia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>). Puparia were removed from the side of the vial with a pair of forceps and glued ventral side down to a slide covered with double-sided adhesive tape. The operculum was removed and puparial case cut open along the dorsal mid-line. Pharate adults were taken out of the case and glued dorsal side down on the tape. Front legs were torn off and mounted on a slide in a droplet of PBS and covered with a cover slip. Gentle pressure was applied on the coverslip to expel the chordotonal organ from the femur. At least three chordotonal organs from three different individuals were imaged for each genotype on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 microscope equipped with 63X Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective in DIC modus. For each organ a stack of 20 z planes were acquired at 0.5<italic>μ</italic>m increments.</p><p id="P50">The primary unit for quantification was the scolopidium, which contains two ciliated neurons. Scolopidia are organized in three groups (1, 2 and 3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">Shanbhag et al., 1992</xref>)). We only used scolopidia from groups 2 and 3. For morphological, numerical quantification and dilation distance measurements three chordotonal organs were used from three different individuals. Screening for dilation defects was done on all images for a given genotype. Defects in scolopidium morphology were observed and scored in the following way: ‘No cilium’ – cilium not detected, ‘Short cilium’ – tip does not reach the cap cell, ‘Regressive cilium’ – thinner, bent ciliary shaft and ‘Vesicles in scolopidial space’. To measure the strength of each phenotype the ratio of morphologically defective scolopidia compared to the total number of scolopidia of a given chordotonal organ was calculated. A gene was scored as abnormal if more than 20% of scolopidia contained neurons that were morphologically defective. To analyse the presence or absence of cilia, we counted the number of scolopidia with no cilium, 1 cilium, 2 cilia or more than 2 cilia. In addition, we assessed morphological defects and mispositioning of the dilations.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> secondary screen - Analysis of defects in chordotonal neurons using Sas-4 and NompC staining</title><p id="P51">Leg chordotonal organs were dissected from 36h old male pupae pupae. Fixation and staining were done as previously described for testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, legs were dissected in PBS. Leg chordotonal organs were placed between slide and coverslip and pushed out of the cuticle by applying gentle pressure. Slides were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After recovering slides and removing the coverslip, samples were incubated in ice-cold methanol for 5min, followed by ice-cold acetone for 2min. Samples were then washed twice with PBS 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by blocking in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 1% BSA for 30min. Primary antibodies for NompC and Sas-4 were diluted 1:500 in blocking solution and added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4C. The next day samples were washed twice with PBS before addition of secondary antibody in PBS for 2h at room temperature. After washing once with PBS, Hoechst 33342 was added for 10min. Samples were air-dried and mounted with mounting medium. Defects for Sas-4 staining (absence) and NompC staining (absence, misposition, redistribution) were scored. 3 different legs were analysed and the average defect per scolopidium reported.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Detailed analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p id="P52">For detailed examination of sperm centrioles and cilia, testes were dissected from 72h-old male pupae.

Immunofluorescence samples were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM980 scanning confocal microscope equipped with an Airyscan unit. Stacks of 0.75μm slices were acquired with a 63x 1.4NA Plan Apochromat lens using single channel mode to avoid cross-illumination.

transition zone (pink), intraflagellar transport (IFT, green), axoneme (black) and centriolar satellites (blue). Cross sections illustrate axonemes of motile and immotile cilia. The latter display multiple additional features, including inner and outer dynein arms, nexins, radial spokes and the central pair complex (yellow). (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of ciliogenesis process (based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Reiter <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>)). In the intracellular pathway, a vesicle forms in association with the basal body. The ciliary transition zone forms immediately distal to the basal body before the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, creating a ciliary pocket. Intraflagellar transport subsequently extends the ciliary axoneme beyond the transition zone. Alternatively, basal bodies dock directly to the plasma membrane prior to transition zone formation and axoneme elongation (dashed arrow). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm, axoneme elongation occurs in an IFT-independent manner within the cytoplasm, whereupon the cilium is extruded from the cell (not depicted). (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic of phylogenetic profiling approach (adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Dey <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>)). Reciprocal BLAST analysis using the human proteome as the starting point creates a presence and absence matrix for each gene across species. Genes functioning together in the same complex/structure or pathway share a similar inheritance pattern across evolution that is distinct from that of unrelated proteins, aiding in the identification of novel components (here: X).

Multiple RNAi lines per gene were crossed with drivers for neurons (Elav) and germline (Nanos and Bam combined), as well as a general driver (Tubulin). Flies were assayed for lethality, uncoordination and male fertility. Each phenotype was scored on a scale of 0 (no phenotype) to 4 (strong). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3A</xref> for definitions. (<bold>B</bold>) Depletion of known centriolar and ciliary transition zone components results in defects in both coordination and male fertility, consistent with their core biogenesis function. In contrast, depletion of BBS and IFT components results in defects in neuronal function only, consistent with their role exclusively in compartmentalized biogenesis. Finally, depletion of axonemal dynein components primarily affects male fertility, although some outer arm dyneins also play significant roles in neuronal function.

Asterisks indicate statistically significant difference to wild-type (t-test, P &lt; 0.001). <italic>mapk-15;elmd-1</italic> double mutants do not display phenotypes stronger than either single mutant (t-test, not significant). (<bold>C</bold>-<bold>E</bold>) <italic>mapk-15</italic> and <italic>elmd-1</italic> mutants display defects in ciliary ultrastructure. (C) Cross-sectional views through the amphid channel reveal defects in cilium extension in both mutants, with fewer cilia protruding into the channel. (D) Quantitation of cilium extension defects at the level of the proximal and distal amphid channel. (E) Higher magnification views of individual cilia reveal defects at the level of the proximal segment of the axoneme (fewer than 9 doublet microtubules), transition zone (disorganization of the central cylinder and overall architecture) and ciliary base (membrane blebs). Percentages reported in figure based on examination of 4 <italic>mapk-15</italic> and 7 <italic>elmd-1</italic> mutants. (<bold>F</bold>) Endogenous/Endogenous promoter GFP fusions to ELMD-1 and MAPK-15 localize to the ciliary base and periciliary membrane compartment in <italic>C. elegans</italic> phasmid neurons, the former marked by the IFT component CHE-11. (<bold>G</bold>, <bold>H</bold>) Localization interdependencies between MAPK-15 and ELMD-1. (G) Loss of ELMD-1 results in a hyperaccumulation of MAPK-15 at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ciliary base, while loss of MAPK-15 impairs localization of ELMD-1, suggesting that (H) MAPK-15 functions upstream of ELMD-1. Scalebars are 10<italic>μ</italic>m (A), 200nm (C, E), 100nm (E, F), 5<italic>μ</italic>m (F, G), 1<italic>μ</italic>m.
