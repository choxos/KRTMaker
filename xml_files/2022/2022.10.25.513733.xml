A plethora of classical, and new paradigms have dissected its precise involvement in emotional and social sensing, learning, and memory. Several important insights resulted from the use of genetic markers – yet, in the age of single cell transcriptomics, the amygdala remains molecularly underdescribed. Here, we present a molecular cell type taxonomy of the full mouse amygdala in fear learning and consolidation. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on naïve and fear conditioned mice, inferred the 130 neuronal cell types distributions in silico using orthogonal spatial transcriptomic datasets, and describe the cell types’ transcriptional responses to learning and memory consolidation. Only a fraction of cells, within a subset of all neuronal types, were transcriptionally responsive to fear learning, memory and retrieval. These activated engram cells upregulated activity-response genes, and processes of synaptic signaling, plasticity, development and neurite outgrowth. Our transcriptome-wide data confirm known actors, and describe several new candidate genes. The atlas may help pinpoint the amygdala’s circuits in performing emotional sensing and integration, and provide new insights to the global cellular processes involved.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The amygdala is part of the medial temporal lobe of the brain. It consists of multiple anatomical regions, developmentally attributed to the striatal, cortical (superficial), and subcortical (deep) structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These subregions are defined by their distinct cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and functionality. Among the commonly studied amygdala functions is fear learning and its circuitry, which involves basolateral, intercalated, and central amygdala clusters. Learning paradigms reflecting other, non-aversive valences (e.g., appetitive behaviors) have since revealed more nuanced amygdala roles in emotional sensing. These alternate functions were often achieved through neuronal populations in the same regional circuitries, distinguished only by different molecular identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Classified as part of the olfactory system, other amygdala regions are widely studied in the social and emotional contexts, where they coordinate adaptive behavioral responses. For example, the medial amygdala is involved in social, parenting, and aggression behaviors, and in memory tasks such as social recognition (reviewed in Petrulis, 2020). Several medial amygdala functions are linked to the gonadal steroid sensitivity of its neurons, some of which have been described systematically <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The cortical amygdala receives direct input from the olfactory bulb, where spatially distinct neurons are activated by odors of positive or negative valence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Finally, neurons of the basomedial amygdala participate in aspects of fear learning as well as defensive and social behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This region has very limited molecular description <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Functional studies have used molecular markers, such as <italic>Fezf2</italic>, <italic>Grp</italic>, <italic>Rspo2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> in LA/BLA, <italic>Prkcd</italic> in CeA, <italic>Foxp2</italic> in IA, and <italic>Trh</italic> in CoA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. But cells defined by a single selected marker gene do not necessarily correspond to a unique neuron type. Four studies described murine amygdala cell types in detail, using scRNA-seq of cells isolated from the medial amygdala <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, basolateral amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and full amygdala part of a cell type atlas of the mouse nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The studies described molecular cell types in details exceeding those of the markers previously known, and suggested a high diversity of underexplored cell types in this brain region. In addition, single-cell transcriptomics has been used for detecting transcriptional signatures of neuronal activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, social behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and learning and memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Aiming to expand the “parts list” available to researchers working in this dynamic field, we used unbiased, high-quality scRNA-seq on whole cells gently dissociated from full amygdala in 23 adult, naïve and fear conditioned mice. We applied parallel approaches to infer spatial distributions of the resulting taxonomy to uncover molecular principles governing this unique niche of developmentally and functionally distinct regions. Finally, we describe which neuronal types participated in fear learning, and the orchestrated transcriptional response across consolidation and retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Whole-cell scRNA-seq on amygdala of adult mice</title><p id="P6">We refined our dissociation protocol to optimize cell viability for conducting whole-cell scRNA-seq on amygdala of adult mice, a region we previously found to be particularly sensitive to dissociation stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. As for other cell dissociations from brain tissue, it was important to minimize handling time from the sacrificing of the mice to loading the cells for scRNA-seq, as well as any stress experienced by the cells during this time (temperature, enzyme, mechanical; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>). Significant improvements in viability came from using a single buffer (artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF), which was formulated particularly for the more sodium-sensitive neurons of adult and aging animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We verified improved amygdala neuronal viability in suspension, which resulted in high scRNA-seq data quality (e.g., &gt;3000 UMI, &gt;2500 genes per neuron). We performed scRNA-seq on full amygdala of 23 adult mice, 16 of which had undergone tone-cued fear conditioning (CFC, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Discussion</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Preliminary analysis revealed 25,330 non-neuronal cells that organized into 14 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), and great diversity among 30,184 high-quality neurons. Neurons were robustly segregated based on their neurotransmitter identity to GABA (<italic>Gad1, Gad2, Slc32a1</italic>) or GLUT, and the glutamatergic ones, into dominant vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 1 (<italic>Slc17a7</italic>) or 2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>).</p><p id="P8">To identify robust but refined molecular cell types, we performed clustering separately on GABA (13,006 cells), VGLUT1 (11,947 cells), and VGLUT2 (5,232 cells) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>), and built a detailed neuronal cell type taxonomy of the mouse amygdala. GABAergic cells were clustered into 56 distinct cell types, VGLUT1 cells into 32 types, and VGLUT2 cells into 42 types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-d</xref>). Clusters were defined by their modulatory and/or exclusive expression of a multitude of enriched genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>). We chose two marker genes for a naming scheme to describe each cell type as precisely as possible. For ease of handling and visualizing the many cell types, we defined more highly correlated clusters as clades (depicted by a color scheme, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, d</xref>) for each of the three main groups: 7 clades for 56 GABAergic, 3 clades for 32 VGLUT1, and 5 clades for 42 VGLUT2 clusters. We detected all cell types in all sampled mice, both naïve and fear-conditioned, at ratios expected according to the sampling depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), meaning that CFC did not affect the cell type identity of any neuronal population.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spatial distributions reflect molecular neuron class</title><p id="P9">The amygdala is a collection of anatomically and functionally defined nuclei belonging to three main structural-developmental compartments: striatal, cortical, and subplate amygdala nuclei. To reconstruct the molecular cell types’ spatial context, we first plotted the expected localization of the three main classes (GABA, VGLUT1, VGLUT2) from expression densities per amygdala nuclei, in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, for <italic>Gad2, Slc17a7</italic>, and <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). As expected, <italic>Gad2</italic> was enriched in the striatal nuclei, especially the central and medial amygdala (CeA and MeA), and sparse in all other amygdala nuclei. Glutamatergic markers were entirely absent from CeA. In the other amygdala nuclei, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 showed little overlap, where <italic>Slc17a6</italic> was striatal and cortical (MeA and CoA-anterior), and <italic>Slc17a7</italic> more restricted to cortical subplate nuclei (LA, BLA). This refines our previous report of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 subtypes dividing largely according to the telencephalon-diencephalon boundary <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, within the ventral compartments of the telencephalon.</p><p id="P10">To guide our analysis of the 130 neuronal types, we next inferred spatial distributions for each cell type by correlating scRNA-seq expression profiles with Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (AMBA) single-gene ISH-based volumetric maps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). Despite the comparatively coarse resolution of 200μm voxels of the ISH-atlas, this helped place most cell types within amygdala nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 3</xref>). For smoother visualization, we parcellated volumetric ISH data into 25μm voxels and performed linear interpolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and subsequent AMBA spatial correlation figures). We found that spatial correlation often followed the molecular taxonomy of cell types, that is, cell types related by gene expression also shared regional origin, with some interesting exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). For example, VGLUT1 clusters largely kept their organization and split according to correlation with BLA vs. CoA, mixing with only a handful of VGLUT2 clusters that localized to the LA. A separate branch of clusters, entirely from VGLUT2 neurons, correlated with anterior CoA. In the MeA and BMA, neurons from VGLUT2 and GABA classes intermixed.</p><p id="P11">Spatial correlation analysis also revealed the relations of amygdala cell types to expression profiles found elsewhere in the brain. As expected, CeA and IA clusters were molecularly related to their dorsal neighbor, caudoputamen. By contrast, MeA nuclei were similar to each other, the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BST), and the hypothalamus—all known to share functions and circuitries in (sexually dimorphic) social behaviors. Both subplate and cortical amygdala areas were related in their high correlation with distinct glutamatergic populations, and as such resembled expression profiles also found in the isocortex and hippocampal formation.</p><p id="P12">Not all neuronal cell types showed high – or any – correlation within amygdala regions. We manually validated these by inspecting single marker genes (AMBA ISH, GENSAT), the literature, and other datasets, and found two explanations: (a) accidental sampling of neighboring structures (e.g., GABA 12, 14 and 15, caudoputamen; VGLUT1 16 and 17, ventral CA3 and DG; GABA 25, globus pallidus); and (b) spatial correlation reached its detection limit. In the latter case, cell types were either restricted to a very small area (e.g., <italic>Avp-Gal</italic> GABA 22, CeA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>; and <italic>Oxt-Avp</italic> VGLUT2 32, MeA), rare (e.g., olfactory clusters VGLUT2 1-17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), or lacked spatial patterning (e.g., GABAergic interneurons GABA 35-56, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">For independent spatial validation, we performed spatial transcriptomics (Visium, 10xGenomics) on 8 coronal sections along the anterior-posterior axis of the amygdala. This approach did not match AMBA-correlation in 3D resolution but detected and quantified ~3,000 genes simultaneously, per data point (mRNA-capture spot). As for AMBA volumetric data, we inferred the spatial distributions of the 130 scRNA-seq neuron types in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 4</xref>). This approach independently validated the generalized AMBA spatial correlation patterns for most clusters. For example, VGLUT1 types were enriched in the basolateral nuclei, whereas VGLUT2 were detected in both cortical and striatal nuclei, with the exception of central amygdala that had only GABA types. Inhibitory interneurons lacked spatial enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Organizational principles behind projection vs. local GABA neurons</title><p id="P14">Our analysis revealed 56 GABAergic neuron types covering the unique combination of cortical and subcortical amygdala compartments, where GABAergic cells are local inhibitory interneurons (e.g., <italic>Sst+, Lamp5+</italic>) and striatal compartments, where projecting inhibitory neurons, called medium spiny neurons (MSNs, e.g. <italic>Ppp1r1b+</italic>), dominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 a, c, e</xref>). To understand without bias how this organization was reflected in expression patterns, we first analyzed which genes were most decisive in determining the split at each level of the cluster dendrogram (branch point marker genes, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). The resulting list of genes revealed hierarchical and combinatorial expression of many (homeodomain) transcription factors, consistent with their role in specifying and maintaining neuronal identity.</p><p id="P15">Determining the first two dendrogram splits were <italic>Wfs1</italic>, <italic>Meis2</italic>, and <italic>Ptk2b</italic> vs. <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Zeb2</italic>, enriched on either distal ends of the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b, d</xref>).

Among regions studied in associative learning, such as fear or appetitive conditioning, BLA glutamatergic cells were more diverse, and more defined, than previously used markers revealed (e.g. <italic>Fezf2, Rspo2</italic>). Their molecular identities correlated with different anterior-posterior distributions, which could explain their role in encoding opposing valences. With regards to a more recent study performing scRNA-seq specifically on the BLA-LA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, we confirmed genes, such as <italic>Cplx1</italic> and <italic>Lynx1</italic> in BLA, and <italic>Rorb</italic> and <italic>Myl4</italic> in LA. Often expression was less BLA-specific in our dataset, which retained the context of all amygdala cells. For example, BLA marker <italic>Rorb</italic> was higher in CoA and <italic>Cplx1</italic> was also expressed across GABAergic interneurons. LA marker <italic>Cdh13</italic> and <italic>Rorb</italic> were higher in CoA, and even BLA types. LA marker <italic>Negr1</italic> was low in a subset of BLA, compared to LA types; but was expressed in virtually all other amygdala neurons, too. CeA GABAergic cells often followed known principles of striatal MSNs (<italic>Ppp1r1b+, Drd1</italic> and/or <italic>Adora2a</italic>), and we found refined markers that may help clarify their roles in valence encoding at greater resolution than the <italic>Prkcd</italic> vs. <italic>Crh</italic> convention. We further propose <italic>Zfhx3</italic> as a marker that distinguishes CeA cells from the highly related CP. Intercalated cells (ITCs) of the IA were most related to CeA cells (<italic>Meis2+Ppp1r1b+Penk+)</italic>. Unlike projecting inhibitory clusters of the CeA and MeA, ITCs also share expression with local inhibitory neurons (<italic>Nfib+/Tshz2</italic>-), providing clues on how projection distance may be encoded. One novel medial CeA cell type (GABA 21) expressed vitamin D receptor <italic>Vdr</italic>, along with a panel of neuropeptides. Future studies may investigate the functional significance of this unique cell type.</p><p id="P51">In the medial amygdala, one group of prolactin receptor-expressing inhibitory neurons (<italic>Prlr)</italic> is of particular interest for parental behavior, and several cell types we found were coherent with a recent study of <italic>Esr1+</italic> MeA cells (e.g., those marked by <italic>St18, Calcr, Esr2</italic>). The CRF-family peptide urocortin 3 (<italic>Ucn3)</italic> was a rare example of a single-marker gene used in functional MeA studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> that indeed conformed to one discrete cell type (GABA 24). The MeA also contained many neuropeptide-enriched glutamatergic cell types of the VGLUT2 class that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been functionally addressed before. These glutamatergic types were often shared or bore resemblance to cell types found also in the basomedial amygdala (BMA). Beyond the presence of neuropeptide <italic>Adcyap1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, the BMA has not been molecularly described in the literature.

Amygdala neurons were highly diverse, which denoted primarily their association with a developmental subregion. At the same time, our study revealed principles underlying the organization of the regions, as well as their developmental or functional relation to one another. For instance, we described the characteristic division of glutamatergic cells into their vesicular glutamate transporters <italic>Slc17a7</italic> or <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, and other gene modules, consistent with functional divisions. Here, the cortical amygdala stood out, with distinct molecular markers expressed along its anterior-posterior axis, including class-defining vesicular glutamate transporters and branch point marker genes such as <italic>Zeb2. Zeb2</italic> and others (e.g., <italic>Ptk2b, Satb1, Mafb</italic>) also reflected organizing principles of GABAergic neurons, such as discriminating local vs. long-range projecting types.</p><p id="P53">We present the first taxonomy-wide quantification of transcriptional response to fear-learning. We argue that single-cell resolution, and unbiased, transcriptome-wide coverage is critical in identifying the response that is expected in only a small subset of cells (the engram). To this end, we applied two independent approaches utilizing the high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq. First, we compared activated, vs. non-activated cell states, per cell type. Essentially, this mimicked the experimental use of mouse models using fluorescent reporters to identify IEG-expressing engram neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> (e.g. <italic>Arc::dVenus</italic>) <italic>in silico</italic>. We found, however, that a single IEG was unlikely to mark the full pallet of neuronal activation at every timepoint and we opted to use a consensus panel of activity regulated genes, or IEGs instead. Indeed, different IEGs were highly expressed in just a subset of neurons and displayed time-dependent dynamics in response to fear conditioning. This observation was in line with recent reports using transcriptomics Methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, where the detection of activity regulated genes expanded well beyond the brief expression windows described in the past. In our second approach we present gene expression correlation as a new, powerful tool to identify subsets of cells within cell types that display orchestrated responses related to learning and memory, especially when IEG induction is absent (recall). Independently, both approaches revealed that not all neuronal types were equally likely to participate in the response to fear conditioning. In fact, closely related molecular cell types from the same anatomical compartment could have a strong response, or completely lack activation. This observation may help explain the encoding of opposing valences (e.g. appetitive vs. aversive) in cells and circuitries of the same compartments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Importantly, we also identified signatures that were regulated in activated subsets within each cell type. We confirmed known actors, and described several new candidate genes, with some class-specificity. For example, <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> could serve as predictors for induction of learning-related cellular processes in similar datasets. Activated engram cells upregulated and coregulated activity-response genes, and processes of synaptic signaling, plasticity, development and neurite outgrowth.</p><p id="P54">Single-cell transcriptomics was used for detecting more general transcriptional signatures of neuronal activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.

As a word of caution, however, the approach and our study contain a few limitations. First, even highly refined current protocols dependent on physical dissociation of live cells may continue to suffer from dissociation stress and sampling noise, obscuring subtle expression signatures. Second, to identify subtle transcriptional states at cell-type resolution requires deep sampling, making scRNA-seq an expensive approach, especially in several experimental groups and biological repeats. As a result, we were not able to include all relevant behavioral controls, which for example does not allow us to distinguish the effect of context or cue. Finally, given the volume of data, we provide validation of neuronal types, but it was beyond the scope of the current study to validate activated states functionally.</p><p id="P55">In sum, we provide a resource of amygdala neuron populations, resolved in molecular and spatial detail. The wide scope and unbiased nature of this study revealed known and novel amygdala cell types, and their activated states. We describe cell type marker genes and gene modules regulated as a response to CFC. We provide a browsable companion website of cluster-wise scRNA-seq gene expression and spatial correlation data, for independent data exploration. Given the great knowledge about amygdala functions and circuitries, and a plethora of available behavioral paradigms and genetic tools, this taxonomy may serve to clarify the particular contributions of molecularly defined neurons, and dissect the participation of specific candidate genes in learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S18"><title>Mice and ethics</title><p id="P56">All mice and their corresponding experimental groups are listed Table S1.

Briefly, we used the AMBA aggregated data, which provides an “energy score” for each gene from the <italic>in situ</italic> experiment, per each voxel of 200×200×200μm. Each 200μm voxel also has an AMBA-generated brain region annotation (the Atlas has a finer resolution of 25μm voxels). Next, we calculated the <italic>rho</italic> correlation of each cell type (average expression profile) and each voxel in the brain (left hemisphere), as follows: we defined genes that have valid expression in the AMBA database as covering &gt;30 voxels, a &gt;5 “energy score”, and an average over all voxels &gt;0.2. The set of quality genes was intersected with the set of genes from the final feature selection of our scRNA-seq data analysis (Step 3). The <italic>rho</italic> correlation of each cell type with the region-annotated 200μm voxels is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. For better resolution and smooth visualization, we parcellated the coarse 200μm voxels to a finer, linear interpolated 25μm grid, and visualized resulting heatmaps on one coronal hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>AMBA-based virtual in situ hybridization (Slc17a7, Slc17a6, Gad2)</title><p id="P81">Based on the AMBA histology <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) gene expression database, we sampled three representative coronal sections, spanning the anterior-posterior amygdala for three neuronal marker genes (9 sections overall): <italic>Gad2</italic> for inhibitory neurons, and <italic>Slc17a7</italic> (VGLUT1) and <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (VGLUT2) for excitatory neurons. We segmented ISH gene expression to cells using global thresholding. We aligned the sections with the AMBA for region annotation, accounting for section distortion along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. Next, we normalized expression levels for each gene in all aligned section subregions, to uncover differential levels of expression relative to subregion size and visualized them as heatmaps.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) Visium (10x Genomics)</title><p id="P82">For spatial transcriptomics, 2 adult mice (1 male, 1 female) were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with aCSF. We quickly extracted, coated, and cryomold-embedded the fresh brains in cryoprotective OCT (TissueTek), flash-froze them in isopentane equilibrated on dry ice, and maintained them in sealed bags at −80°C until processing. Per brain, we collected 4 right-hemisphere coronal cryosections at 10μm thickness, aiming at approximately 200-300μm spacing, spanning the anterior-posterior axis of the amygdala, onto the Visium ST gene expression slide (4 capture areas, 10x Genomics). For tissue preparation, we followed the manufacturer’s instructions, with the following specifications: methanol fixation, immunofluorescence staining with DAPI only (no antibody), imaging at 4× on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2: DIC, DAPI, and TRITC channels for fiducial and section alignment and 25min permeabilization, as we had previously determined on amygdala test sections, using the Tissue Optimization kit. We then proceeded with the Visium Gene Expression Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions, with 15 PCR cycles for cDNA amplification. Sequencing was performed on Illumina NGS platforms to a depth of 150-200M reads per sample (i.e., capture area, or section).</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Visium ST alignment and quality control</title><p id="P83">To map the anatomical annotation for each 2D capture spot, we aligned the DAPI images of Visium ST sections to the AMB Reference Atlas, correcting for distortion caused by sectioning along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. Sections were on average 100μm apart, with considerable variability (z-axis resolution); mRNA-capture spot diameters were 55μm, centers 100μm apart (x-y resolution). An average 3,226 capture spots covered each coronal hemisphere, 5-10% of which mapped to the amygdala (mean 272 spots). Spots that aligned with the amygdala contained ~2,500-3,500 genes and ~30,000 UMIs.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis of Visium ST data</title><p id="P84">With the exception of the spatial barcodes replacing cell barcodes (spots instead of cells), analysis was similar to the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline described above. Each spatial barcoded spot of 55μm diameter was expected to capture multiple cells (including neurons, glia, and vasculature), resulting in “micro-bulk” expression data. We previously found non-neuronal cells to be less spatially distinct in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and therefore, expected genes derived from non-neurons to be noisy, sporadic, and spatially less informative. To focus on neuronal diversity instead, we removed non-neuronal marker genes from analysis.</p><p id="P85">Briefly, after preprocessing, filtering, normalizing, and feature selection, we performed dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) of the high-dimensional expression data, followed by 2D embedding with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), based on their similarity in the high-dimensional gene expression space. This resulted in a 2D map. Focusing on neuronal markers, we clustered these spots according to their distance in 2D, using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Thus, spots with similar gene expression were grouped together in the same cluster. We also used <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors (KNN) to regroup the outlier spots obtained from the DBSCAN algorithm into their closest neighbor cluster. Next, we remapped the spots to their original location on the tissue, based on the spatial barcode index, and inspected whether the clusters followed an unbiased spatial distribution in the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S44"><title>Visium ST-based spatial correlation analysis</title><p id="P86">Analogously to AMBA-based spatial correlation (above), we used Visium ST expression data to infer the spatial distributions of scRNA-seq annotated cell type mean cluster expression. First, we performed feature selection of highly variable genes for scRNA-seq and Visium ST datasets separately, then combined and intersected the two gene lists. After normalizing both datasets, we conducted pairwise linear Pearson correlations between each scRNA-seq cluster and each Visium spatial spot (2D). This resulted in a matrix of <italic>rho</italic> correlation values for each spot with each cell type, which we mapped back to the original xy-position of the relevant section. For 1450 global pattern comparison, we normalized the <italic>rho</italic> correlation values and presented all the section spots together in a heatmap form. Having a registered anatomical annotation for each 2D capture spot (see above, Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) Visium), we quantified spatial correlations for each scRNA-seq cluster per region, as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

We collected 16μm coronal cryosections spanning the amygdala on 2% APTES silenized glass slides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, proceeded with quick post-fixation in 4% PFA for 10min, 2 washes in PBS, dehydration in isopropanol, and stored slides in 70% ethanol at 4°C until further processing. Before hybridization, sections were briefly dehydrated in 100% ethanol, airdried, and encircled with a hydrophobic barrier pen. Starting with Protease 4 pre-treatment, we used the RNAScope Fluorescent Multiplex (3-plex) Reagent Kit (ACDBio) and followed the manufacturer’s instructions. The following mouse probes were combined for 3-plexing in alternating channels: Slc17a6 #319171, Slc17a7 #416631, Gad2 #439371, Gal #400961, Avp, O2 #472261, Sim1 #526501. Sections were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 epifluorescence microscope at 4× and 20× magnification. Image processing was carried out using NIS Elements software (Nikon), and final images, LUTs 95th to 99th percentile, were batch exported using MATLAB. To map sections to anatomical annotations, we aligned DAPI images with the AMB Reference Atlas, adjusting for distortions along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes caused by sectioning.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Cell activity score by high IEG expression (IEG score)</title><p id="P88">We defined a set of eight immediate early genes (IEGs): <italic>Arc, Bdnf, Btg2, Fos, Fosl2, Homer1, Npas4, Nr4a1</italic>, calculated the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile expression for each.
