Macropinocytosis is a conserved endocytic process in which cells project cups from their plasma membrane to engulf droplets of medium into micron-sized vesicles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. It is used for feeding by cancer cells and amoebae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and to take up antigens by immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Viruses and bacteria use macropinocytosis to infect cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, while it is the delivery route for mRNA vaccines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Despite this clear medical importance, and its discovery nearly 100 years ago <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, only recently has macropinocytosis started to attract major attention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Fundamental questions therefore remain, such as: how are macropinocytic cups formed; what supports them; what makes them close; and how do they close?</p><p id="P5">Macropinocytosis is driven by the actin cytoskeleton, with PIP3 also playing a crucial role, as shown by genetic and inhibitor studies and its localization to forming macropinosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, PIP3 forms discrete domains in the plasma membrane, which can be microns across, and around which macropinocytic cups form <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These domains are complex and include active- Ras, which activates PI3-kinase, and active-Rac, which activates actin polymerization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Domains are regulated by RasGAPs such as NF1 and RGBARG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, while PIP3 itself recruits effectors required for macropinocytosis, such as the protein kinase Akt and actin polymerization regulator, Leep1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. PIP3 domains form cell-autonomously, without the need for external signals. How they function in macropinocytosis remains unclear.</p><p id="P6">We have proposed that PIP3 domains recruit the Scar/WAVE complex to their periphery, thus creating a ring of protrusive F-actin around themselves and forming the walls of macropinocytic cups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. While this property of PIP3 domains helps explain how cups are shaped, it does not explain how they close.</p><p id="P7">Although macropinocytic cups are readily visible by microscopy, they are hard to follow in 3D due to their size, dynamism and the light-sensitivity of cells. Lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) gives a new approach, allowing macropinocytic cups to be followed in 3D from birth to closure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To match this advance in microscopy, image analysis methods need extending to 3-dimensional time series, to segment cells and PIP3 domains and to measure fluorescent intensities along the plasma membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, using lattice light sheet microscopy and custom computational analysis, we have followed macropinocytosis and PIP3 domains in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> model with unprecedented detail. We describe how cups are structured, expand and close, and infer some general principles behind their organization. This leads to a physical model, based on the behaviour of PIP3 domains, which reproduces cup closure and several other features that we observe.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Macropinosomes form from cups that can close at lip or base</title><p id="P9">Lattice light-sheet microscopy allows macropinocytosis to be followed for 5-10 minutes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells in 3D at around 0.3 Hz, with two fluorescent channels. Cells were observed at low density in a simple medium, where they maintain macropinocytosis for at least a day <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We initially used Ax2 cells with paired reporters for PIP3 (PkgE-PH-GFP), marking the membrane of macropinocytic cups, and F-actin (lifeAct-mCherry) revealing the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Macropinosomes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells form almost exclusively from cups projected from the cell surface, consistent with earlier work showing ‘crowns’ on growing cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells thus resemble macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, though we did not observe macropinosomes forming from linear ruffles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, nor were ‘tentpole’ filopodial projections of F-actin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> notably involved.</p><p id="P11">Cups form on any exposed part of cells and frequently move around as they develop. On average cells have 2.71±1.71 PIP3 domains and produce 1.8±1.2 macropinosomes per minute (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Table S1</xref>), ranging up to more than 5 microns in their longest dimension. Rates and sizes varied greatly. After closing, macropinosomes lose first their F-actin coat, and then their PIP3 reporter.</p><sec id="S4"><title>Macropinocytic cups can close in two different ways</title><p id="P12">Unexpectedly, we observed that macropinocytic cups can close in two ways, which we call lip and basal closures, of which lip closure is roughly twice as common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">movies 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). In lip closure, cups close at, or near, the lip and include nearly all the PIP3 domain in the resulting macropinosome. Residual PIP3 in the plasma membrane fades away, extinguishing the domain and terminating macropinocytosis from that site. In a complex variant, macropinocytic cups form lobes, which appear as over-lapping arcs of PIP3- reporter in maximum-intensity projections. When these composite structures close, several macropinosomes are released almost simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Figure S1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">movie 4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In basal closure, cups deepen and narrow, then constrict locally before pinching off a macropinosome near the base. A large proportion of the PIP3 domain remains in the plasma membrane, where it can yield further macropinosomes. This sequence generally terminates by closure at the lip and extinction of the PIP3 domain.</p><p id="P14">Macropinosomes formed by either route frequently remained attached to the cell surface by a thin tether, which can persist for 10 seconds or more, before rupturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, 51.9 sec; also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Figure S1A and B</xref>. As tethers are visible with the PIP3 reporter, we assume that they are narrow tubes of membrane, although the individual walls are not resolved. This implies that macropinosomes are not fully sealed and released until the tether is ruptured. Tethers are under further investigation.</p><p id="P15">Cups can also fail. Most commonly, the PIP3 domain simply fades away, followed by its associated F-actin. Or there can be an abortive closure in which the cup constricts but does not close (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Figure S1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Macropinocytosis is similar in non-axenic cells</title><p id="P16">Strain Ax2 is a laboratory workhorse, which like other axenic strains has been selected for growth in liquid medium. This is enabled by a high rate of macropinocytosis due to deletion of the conserved RasGAP, NF1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether non-axenic cells, with intact NF1, perform macropinocytosis in a similar way.</p><p id="P17">DdB cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> were grown in enriched liquid medium to stimulate macropinocytosis and examined using the PIP3/F-actin reporter combination. They produce generally smaller PIP3 domains and macropinosomes than Ax2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Figure S1D-G</xref>). Both lip and basal closures, as well as tethers, are observed, showing that these are common features of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Movies 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>How macropinocytic cups are organized: PIP3 domain and Factin scaffold</title><p id="P18">PIP3 domains are singular features of macropinocytic cups in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To use these as landmarks for mapping other components, we developed computational tools to identify PIP3 domains by first segmenting the cell surface and then the PIP3 domains themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This two-step procedure means that PIP3-rich vesicles are excluded, once released from the cell surface. Intensities of a panel of reporters and GFP-fusions (see methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Table S3</xref>) were then measured along the membrane from the domain boundary, with the bottom of the cup providing a second reference point, and geometric parameters calculated, such as domain area and curvature. Importantly, this approach allowed us to average over multiple events.</p><sec id="S7"><title>PIP3 domains occupy the inner face of macropinocytic cups and produce phosphoinositide gradients</title><p id="P19">We define the lip of cups by the inflection in their membrane curvature and find that the PIP3 domain boundary falls just inside the lip, with PIP3 levels elevated over the entire inner face of the cup and falling off further out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Mapping the distribution of PIP3 shows a striking gradient within domains, with its high point at their base.</p><p id="P20">PI4,5P2 - the substrate for synthesis of PIP3 by PI3-kinases – has a reciprocal gradient with levels lower inside macropinocytic cups than outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). PTEN, which reverts PIP3 to PI4,5P2, also has a reciprocal distribution, with high levels outside the cup and over the whole plasma membrane, and low levels within the cup, consistent with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">PI4P, a relatively abundant phosphoinositide of the plasma membrane, shows little change in distribution in PIP3 domains, while PI3,4P2 is near background, but increases strongly in macropinosomes once cups close (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PIP3 domains are critical for macropinocytosis</title><p id="P22">To help define the importance of PIP3 domains in macropinocytosis, we examined mutants of PIP3 signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Figure S2</xref>). These have greatly reduced fluid uptake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, but their functional defects have been hard to pin down.</p><p id="P23">At one extreme, in a mutant lacking all five ‘type-1’ PI3-kinases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, PIP3 domains are abolished, but the underlying domains of active Ras still form. These appear incapable of macropinocytosis. Conversely, when PTEN is deleted the PIP3 domains grow to encompass the entire cell surface but are capable of only very inefficient macropinocytosis, forming occasional small macropinosomes. A similar, but less extreme phenotype is produced by deletion of the RasGAP, RGBARG in which cells are only able to perform base closures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, PIP3 domains are essential, or nearly so, for macropinocytosis, but must be properly regulated.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Macropinocytic cups are mechanically supported by an F-actin scaffold</title><p id="P24">Macropinocytic cups require structural support to prevent their collapse by membrane tension. We therefore examined their actin cytoskeleton using reporters for selected cytoskeletal proteins, each paired with a PIP3 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">Figure S3</xref>). No clear structural differences were observed between cups that ultimately closed at lip or base, allowing inclusion of both in our analysis.</p><p id="P25">This mapping shows that macropinocytic cups have a continuous layer of F-actin over their whole extent, from top to bottom, which is very clear in deep cups and extends some distance beyond the rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This layer is thicker in the cup than in more remote areas of the plasma membrane, consistent with it providing structural support.</p><p id="P26">Coronin binds F-actin, with a preference for newly formed filaments and regulates actin dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. It is strongly recruited to cups, concentrating towards the rim. Single-headed myosins link F-actin to membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, with several strongly recruited to macropinocytic cups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Myosin-1B is recruited towards the periphery of cups, whereas the PIP3-binding myosin-1E is concentrated towards the base, closely matching the distribution of PIP3. Carmil <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> is only modestly enriched in cups. Although microtubules (labelled with GFP-alpha-tubulin) moved actively within the cytoplasm and made fleeting contacts with macropinocytic structures, we did not detect any prolonged association between them suggestive of a structural role in cups.</p><p id="P27">These results show that macropinocytic cups are organized around essential PIP3 domains and supported by a specialized F-actin scaffold, in which the myosin-1 proteins may be linkers to the membrane that prevent it delaminating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Evidence that PIP3 domains shape rings of dendritic actin polymerization around themselves</title><p id="P28">We have proposed that PIP3 domains produce cupped structures by creating a ring of actin polymerization around their periphery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. To further test this idea, we took advantage of the sensitivity of LLSM to image the Scar/WAVE complex – which activates dendritic actin polymerization - through the entire life cycle of macropinocytic cups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Movies 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">9</xref> show that NAP-GFP is recruited in striking rings around PIP3 domains. A reporter for the Arp2/3 complex, which is activated by Scar/WAVE, was also recruited in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Movie 10</xref>), as also recently reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Following the NAP-GFP rings over time demonstrated that they are ever-present at the rim of cups, from early in their life, through their expansion and into closure. The persistence of Scar/WAVE at the edge of PIP3 domains was quantified and confirmed by space-time plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Taking recruitment of the Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes as reporting sites of actin polymerization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, these results confirm that PIP3 domains are encircled by a ring of dendritic actin polymerization.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>How cups close</title><p id="P30">En face views show that lip closure occurs by concerted inward movement of the lips until the orifice is sealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Movie 11</xref>). In principle, this might be due to a purse-string constriction, driven by myosin-II, as proposed for phagocytic cups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, we could not detect myosin-II at the lip or elsewhere in cups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">Figure S3</xref>) and macropinocytosis is insensitive to blebbistatin inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Rather, the Scar/WAVE reporter is present as a contracting ring throughout closure. Thus, we propose that cups close by actin polymerization at their lip, which is re-directed inwards.</p><p id="P31">Examining basal closures in a similar way, we found that Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 were not detectably recruited at the site of closure. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Movie 9</xref>), where a basal closure is followed by a lip closure. Scar/WAVE is not recruited to the basal closure site, but only to the lip, providing a positive control for the reporter. This indicates that base closure is not driven by localized actin polymerization at the site of closure.</p><p id="P32">Significantly, Scar/WAVE remains at the lip of cups during basal closure, suggesting that actin polymerization continues there, and may drive closure indirectly. Accordingly, the cup elongates and narrows (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">Figure S4</xref>), presumably stretching the membrane, until eventually a macropinosome is pinched off.</p><p id="P33">Consistent with this, mapping F-actin and PIP3 through the last minute of cup lifetime shows that both reporters maintain their relative distributions, possibly with some intensification 20-30 seconds before closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-G</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Detailed observation of basal closure shows that the PIP3-positive membrane often delaminates from the F-actin scaffold at the site of closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Movies 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">13</xref>). This indicates both that the membrane is under significant tension and that local pinching by the actin cytoskeleton is not the cause of closure. Similar delaminations are also observed with cups closing near the lip, indicating that membrane tension also contributes to lip closure.</p><p id="P35">Superficially, the two closure methods appear to have different mechanisms, but both involve continued actin polymerization at the lip, driven by Scar/WAVE. We propose that cups close at the lip by redirecting this actin polymerization inwards; and at the base by using it to deepen the cup, increasing membrane tension until delamination and basal sealing of a macropinosome occurs.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Macropinocytic cups close when their PIP3 domain ceases expanding</title><p id="P36">What triggers macropinocytic cup closure? We noticed from area measurements that cups tend to close when their PIP3 domain stops expanding. Since this leads to a plausible model for closure (next section), we examined the correlation in detail.</p><p id="P37">First, we analysed a set of domains that could be followed from their origin to the formation of a macropinosome by lip closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Movie 14</xref>). All originate with a small PIP3 domain associated with a pre-existing focus of Factin (11/11 cases). This F-actin focus is usually small, but occasionally can be a pseudopod, which is then subverted into a macropinocytic cup. The individual traces of domain area, perimeter and depth are strikingly variable, whether aligned by domain initiation or closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C and D</xref>) due primarily to their spread of lifetimes (30-130 sec). To better discern overall trends, we combined plots by normalizing both time and the geometric parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The life history of an average domain can be divided into phases. In the first, it expands with a steadily increasing area, while deepening and increasing in perimeter. We measured the rate of area increase in the expansion phase, both in the selected set of domains and in a larger set, obtaining values of 0.35±0.16 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (N=11) and 0.30±0.34 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (N=27) respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Table S1</xref>). Since the area increases approximately linearly with time, the domain boundary moves at a decreasing speed (proportional to 1/r for a circular domain). This can be regarded as a phase where an expanding wave of actin polymerization captures membrane into the cup, which remains relatively shallow and open. In the second phase, starting at around 0.6 of normalized lifetime, the domain slows and stops expanding. Finally, the perimeter deceases towards zero as the cup closes, the depth may also increase, while the area holds steady or decreases slightly. These last two phases can be regarded as a period in which a nearly constant area of membrane is manipulated by the actin cytoskeleton into a closed vesicle.</p><p id="P39">In a second test of the correlation, we selected cups which could be followed for the last minute before closure and classified them as either lip or basal closures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">Figure S4</xref>). In lip closures the area of the domain does not increase in this period, and may even decrease just before closure, while the depth also only increases slightly, while perimeter decreases rapidly in the last 20 seconds, confirming our previous observations. Basal closure differs: although the area also does not increase over the last 30 seconds, the cup deepens around 2-fold before a macropinosome is pinched off.</p><p id="P40">These different approaches show that macropinocytic cups close when their PIP3 domain stop expanding. This suggests a mechanistic hypothesis: cup closure is caused by stalling the expansion of their PIP3 domain.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>A ‘stalled wave’ model for macropinocytic cup closure</title><p id="P41">Our observations suggest a mechanism for macropinocytic cup closure.

The evolving shape of macropinocytic cups is then produced by the interplay of domain expansion with forces produced by actin polymerization in the protrusive zone and membrane tension. Actin polymerization within the cup due to formins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and the signalling dynamics sustaining PIP3 domains are not considered.</p><p id="P46"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows the model intuitively: in the expansion phase (top), the PIP3 domain expands, capturing more membrane and forming an expanding F-actin wave <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The zone of actin polymerization is directed outwards and does not remain under the same area of membrane for long, so that the cup remains shallow. As the domain stalls, the actin polymerization zone remains for longer under any area of membrane, the cup deepens and the zone of actin polymerization slips inside it so that it becomes directed inward, potentially giving a lip closure.</p><p id="P47">The model produces a range of behaviours depending on the parameters chosen: lip closure at different sizes; elongation with increasing membrane tension giving a basal closure if local delamination occurs; and a persistent, unclosed cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). These outcomes can be largely controlled by the polymerization force parameter (K<sub>p</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The polymerization force drives the protrusion of the lip, and therefore determines the relationship between the lip and the domain boundary. Lip closure occurs if the zone of actin polymerization slips into the cup. It is prevented if the zone of actin polymerization remains near the lip, pointing outwards. This can be achieved if the tension generated in plane with the membrane (parameterized by K<sub>t</sub>) constricts the cup, elongating the PIP3 domain and pushing its boundary toward the lip, keeping pace with the protruding lip and maintaining the position of the polymerization zone.</p><p id="P48">In a narrow tube structure, the tension force in a 3D surface of rotation is substantially larger than in the 2D contour due to the high mean curvature of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). By adapting the tension force to account for the full 3D surface, we can additionally provide a model of basal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). When the inward force generated by tension exceeds the adhesion force between membrane and scaffold, it causes local delamination and sealing of a macropinosome.</p><p id="P49">Our model can therefore reproduce both lip and basal closures, depending on the parameters chosen, showing that the starting propositions provide a route to understanding how macropinocytic cups form and close.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P50">Lattice light-sheet microscopy gives a new window into the formation and closure of macropinocytic cups, a process that is largely unexplained. Macropinosomes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> form from cups, not from membrane flaps, and are organized around essential domains of PIP3 that extend to the lip of the cup. They are supported by a specialized F-actin framework, including actin-binding proteins, such as coronin, and the PIP3-binding myosin-1E, which is strongly concentrated within cups, and may anchor the membrane to the cytoskeleton.</p><p id="P51">Cupped or circular structures of the plasma membrane require an organizing principle to shape them. We propose that this principle is the ability of PIP3 domains to attract dendritic actin polymerization to their periphery by recruiting the Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes. Supporting this idea, VASP, which interacts with Scar/WAVE, is similarly recruited to the lips of macropinocytic cups, where it may accelerate actin polymerization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Basal closure has not been described before to our knowledge, though the elongated tube-like intermediates resemble the macropinocytic structures of giant amoebae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Both modes of closure appear to be driven by continued actin polymerization at the lip, which generates membrane tension within the cup: in one case we propose that the zone of actin polymerization slips inside the lip and the aperture is closed by re-directed actin polymerization; in the other, actin polymerization is not re-directed, but instead causes elongation of the cup, stretching the membrane so that eventually a macropinosome is pinched off to release the tension. Somewhat against expectation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> a contractile, myosin-II-based activity does not appear to be required for closure by either mechanism.</p><p id="P53">Our modelling treats macropinocytic cups in 2D and only considers mechanical forces.

The model of Saito and Sawai <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, although enacted differently to our model, also incorporates the propositions of actin polymerization around PIP3 domains and domain stalling, and likewise reproduces cup formation and closure at the lip, indicating that these are robust consequences of the initial assumptions.</p><p id="P54">PIP3 domains themselves are not well understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. They can form spontaneously and are likely based on a reaction-diffusion system, with autocatalysis and cross-inhibition of diffusing molecules, including Ras, PIP3 and Rac. Active-Ras, which activates PI3-kinase, may be at the core of this system, since Ras domains can form in the absence of PIP3 domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, whereas increasing Ras activity gives bigger PIP3 domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Their size may also be limited by the need for PI4,5P2 to diffuse into them for conversion to PIP3, as suggested by our detection of opposing gradients of these phosphoinositides. Finally, their ability to attract actin polymerization to their periphery may be due to the creation of an annulus around them, where Rac activation outweighs its inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P55">In summary, we have described macropinocytosis in greater detail than hitherto and gained mechanistic insights, leading to a simple model for cup closure seen as resulting from stalled expansion of PIP3 domains.

Similarly, group (2) mostly used the same parameter configuration (80%), with small variation from this configuration otherwise.

These meshes take the form of a set of vertices and a set of triangular faces that connect the vertices. In order to measure the fluorescence on the membrane, the fluorescence values in the image were projected onto the surface. This was performed using line scans along the direction normal to the surface. For a given vertex <italic>v</italic> on the surface, the image voxel coordinates along a line <italic>l</italic> normal to the surface through <italic>v</italic> were calculated. Line scans were truncated to avoid including voxels containing membrane at another part of the cell surface; if a point <italic>p</italic> in <italic>l</italic> is closer to another point on the surface than to <italic>v</italic>, then <italic>l</italic> is truncated at <italic>p</italic> and any points beyond <italic>p</italic> are discarded from <italic>l</italic>. A minimum distance of 2 voxels (approx. 0.2 μm) was imposed on the truncation to prevent zero-length line scan in highly curved parts of the surface. Lines had a maximum length of 1 μm (1.5 μm for actin fluorescence). Each vertex was assigned the maximum fluorescence value along its line scan. Background subtraction of the fluorescence was applied to the image prior to projection using a top hat filter of radius 10 voxels for all images.</p><p id="P69">For the purpose of computing line scans, all surfaces were smoothed using Laplacian smoothing. Projecting actin fluorescence onto the surface additionally required shrinking the surface areas of high mean curvature. This is because the actin cortex lies slightly below the membrane, and therefore the peak fluorescence is farther from the surface than other markers. Given that highly curved areas introduce extreme truncation of line scans, this would lead to the actin at the lip of the macropinocytic cups being reduced. We solved this problem by shrinking the surface under mean curvature flow, which forces the surface to shrink in highly curved regions. In order to avoid simultaneously shrinking the cups during this process, mean curvature flow was only applied in regions of positive mean curvature. Positive mean curvature flow was applied until any point on the surface had moved up to a maximum of 5 μm from its original position.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Annotation</title><p id="P70">Surfaces were annotated using MiCellAnnGELo, a VR software for rapid annotation of surfaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

For <italic>de novo</italic> domain formation events, markers were placed in frames prior to this event at the approximate location of the forming domain. Similarly, after domain elimination events markers were placed in subsequent frames at the approximate location of the extinguished domain. When a single domain contained more than one cup, separate markers were placed in each cup. Markers were grouped in sequences by first measuring the distance from markers in each frame to markers in the following frame and pairing each marker to the closest marker in the following frame. This pairing process was repeated in reverse, and two markers were grouped together if they paired in both directions. Occasionally, markers moved large distances between frames, for example during a closure event, leading to them no longer pairing with the corresponding marker in the previous frame. These markers we regrouped later in the pipeline by comparing manual annotations of sequences and joining sequences with no overlapping frames, but with the same manual annotations in each frame.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>PIP3 domain segmentation</title><p id="P71">Domains were identified around each marker using Otsu thresholding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> of the PIP3 fluorescence values on the surface.

In cases where structures such as cup lips or ruffles present as thin protrusions with PIP3 on only one side of the structure, a low level of PIP3 will be projected onto the other side in the surface representation due to spreading of the fluorescence during image capture.

If we also consider the 3D membrane tension force within a cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>) and assume a rigid actin scaffold is holding the membrane in place, we can identify a potential mechanism for base closure, given a partial delamination of the membrane from the actin scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p id="P92">If a portion of the membrane in the cup, approximating a cylinder of length l and width w, delaminates from the actin cytoskeleton, then it will start to move under membrane tension. Here, we model the tension force as proportional to mean curvature, while assuming all other forces are negligible. If the aspect ratio l/w &lt; 0.66 (approx.), then the membrane in the cylinder can attain a minimum surface area without closure. We therefore enforce an aspect ratio greater than 0.66 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> when setting the length of the delamination zone, allowing the membrane to continue to move inwards until closure. It is conceivable that smaller initial delamination lengths could also lead to base closure, since tension at the edges of the delaminated region would be increased, leading to further detachment from the actin cytoskeleton. A similar effect can also occur during lip closure but is not essential for closure in this case.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary

cell expressing reporters for PIP3 (green) and F-actin (magenta). The PIP3 reporter reveals the PIP3 domain of macropinocytic cups and early macropinosomes and the F-actin reporter reveals their structural scaffold. (A) Orthogonal projections of a single cell (x,y top left) having three macropinocytic areas. (B) Time sequence from the same cell. Yellow-boxed area: cup closing at the lip releases a large macropinosome at 13 sec, whose PIP3 signal intensifies and then fades away by 50 sec. The domain itself is extinguished. Blue-boxed area: successive basal closures at a second PIP3 domain. Small macropinosomes are released at 38 sec and 63 sec, before the domain closes at the lip at 139 sec and is extinguished. (C) Lip-closure at higher temporal resolution with split colours, corresponding to the yellow-boxed area. Arrow: a tether between macropinosome and the cell surface revealed by the PIP3 reporter – it is presumed to be a thin tube. (D) Basal-closure at higher temporal resolution with split colours, corresponding to the blue-boxed area. Arrow: newly separated macropinosome and persistent PIP3 in plasma membrane. Ax2 cells transformed with pPI304 to express reporters for PIP3 (PkgE-PH-GFP) and F-actin (lifeAct-mCherry) were viewed in imaging medium by LLSM with full volumes taken every 1.7 sec. Maximum intensity projections are shown. Scale bars: A and B = 5 μm; C and D = 2 μm.

Domains were inspected and annotated manually using virtual reality. Vesicles not attached to the plasma membrane are excluded by this process. The lip of cups is defined by the inflection in membrane curvature. (B) PIP3 domain and F-actin scaffold: the PIP3 domain occupies the inner surface of the cup, with little spill-over beyond the lip, and the cup is supported by a continuous F-actin scaffold from bottom to just beyond the lip. (C) Cytoskeletal proteins: coronin, carmil (modestly), and myosin1B and 1E are all concentrated in macropinocytic cups, with the PIP3- binding myosin1E mirroring PIP3 and coronin concentrated just beyond the lip. (D) Phosphoinositide gradients: PIP3 is strongly graded with its peak towards the centre of the domain, whereas PTEN, which breaks PIP3 down, is excluded from PIP3 domains. PI4,5P2, the substrate for PIP3 production, shows an outside-in gradient. This is consistent with PIP3 being produced within PIP3 domains and diffusing out for destruction by PTEN; whereas PI4,5P is depleted within the domain by PIP3 formation and replenished by diffusion from outside. PI4P shows little variation. In (B,C,D) the domain boundary is set as zero and distances into the domain are negative and normalized, whereas those outside it are actual distances. (E, F, G) Space-time plots over the last minute before macropinocytic cups close. Both lip and basal closures are included. Cups deepen particularly in the last 10 sec before closure, as shown by the increasingly negative distance from the boundary. There is evidence for increased accumulation of PIP3 and F-actin at 10 to 40 sec before closure. In (E,F,G), the PIP3 domain boundary is set as zero with negative numbers being into the domain and positive beyond it. In all cases the bracketed numbers are the number of cups analysed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155699-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>PIP3 domains shape cupped structures by attracting a ring of dendritic actin polymerization to their periphery</title><p>Dendritic actin polymerization is initiated by the Arp2/3 complex, which is activated by the Scar/WAVE complex.

(B) PIP3 domains corresponding to (A) dissected out computationally, shown enlarged in transverse and en face views. The macropinosome in the last frame is not visible because it is no longer attached to the cell surface. (C,D) Depth, perimeter and area of individual domains followed from origin to closure and aligned either by time of origin or of closure. Although some trends can be discerned, there is considerable variability, especially in lifetime, which varies from 30-130 sec. (E) Double normalized plots of domain depth, perimeter and area. Strikingly, domains stop expanding in area before they close. Lifetime for each domain is normalized to 1 and the dependent variable to the 75<sup>th</sup> centile. The time of closure (0 sec) is taken as the last frame in which the macropinocytic cup is unclosed.

Actin polymerized at the boundary is incorporated into the thick actin layer under the domain, and domain expansion pushes the polymerization zone outward to continue the process. Slowing expansion leads to actin build-up at the domain boundary, redirecting the net force upwards, allowing a cup to form. The same process guides the polymerization force inwards during lip closure, as shown in (E, top). (B) range of cup shapes generated by the model. Magenta: PIP3 domain, green: actin polymerization zone at the domain boundary. (C) Evolution of lip closure over time for the cup shown in (B, ii). (D) Cup measurements: domain perimeter for the cups in (B) over time and phase plots for volume enclosed by a surface of rotation of the domain at closure; time of closure; and aspect ratio, given by length/width of the cup at the final time point. Cups in (B) marked in all plots by numerals, k<sub>T</sub>: tension force coefficient, k<sub>P</sub> polymerization force coefficient, black dashed lines mark the boundary between lip and no closure - only a small increase in polymerization force (25%) is required to switch from lip closure (ii) to a tube (iii). (E) Tension (red – normal, blue – tangential) and polymerization (green) forces acting on the membrane (left half only) for cups shown in (C, t = 51 s) (top) and (B, iii) (bottom), where normal tension has been modified to include curvature from the surface of rotation. The polymerization force pushes the lip inwards for the top cup and outwards for the bottom cup, due to differences in polymerization force overcoming the tension-induced contraction of the cup. Normal tension forces are similar inside both cups, (and larger than outside), but the length of the bottom cup gives more space for delamination shown in (F), giving a higher chance of base closure. (F) Delamination of the membrane from (E, bottom) moving under tension, modelled as a 3D process, which acts to minimize the surface area of the tube. Given a sufficiently large delaminated region, this process leads to closure.
