However, the structure, molecular properties, and evolutionary conservation of Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 are unclear. Here, we present AlphaFold structures of Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 complexes, supported by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and mutagenesis. We show that dimers composed of the Rec114 C-terminus form α-helical chains that cup an N-terminal Mei4 α-helix, and that Mer2 forms a parallel homotetrameric coiled coil. Both Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 bind preferentially to branched DNA substrates, indicative of multivalent protein-DNA interactions. Indeed, the Rec114–Mei4 interaction domain contains two DNA-binding sites that point in opposite directions and drive condensation. The Mer2 coiled-coil domain bridges co-aligned DNA duplexes, likely through extensive electrostatic interactions along the length of the coiled coil. Finally, we show that the structure of Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 are conserved across eukaryotes, while DNA-binding properties vary significantly. This work provides insights into the mechanism whereby Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 complexes promote the assembly of the meiotic DSB machinery, and suggests a model where Mer2 condensation is the essential driver of assembly, with the DNA-binding activity of Rec114–Mei4 playing a supportive role.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In most eukaryotes, the formation of haploid gametes requires Spo11-dependent catalysis of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to initiate meiotic recombination, which is essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hunter 2015</xref>). Spo11 activity relies on a higher-order assembly that is tied to chromosome structure and subject to overlapping regulatory pathways that control the timing, number and distribution of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lam and Keeney 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yadav and Claeys Bouuaert 2021</xref>). However, the molecular assemblies required for meiotic DSB formation are not well characterized, and the degree to which they are conserved is unclear.</p><p id="P3">From fungi to plants and animals, Spo11 activity depends on a cohort of accessory factors. While Spo11 itself is ubiquitous and well-conserved at the sequence level, the auxiliary proteins that constitute the DSB machinery vary more broadly between organisms, and functional homologs tend to be highly divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Keeney 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">de Massy 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lam and Keeney 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, some of the key partners are found throughout eukaryotes, including a sub-group referred to as RMM (Rec114, Mei4 and Mer2) in S. cerevisiae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Maleki et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kumar et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stanzione et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tesse et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Vrielynck et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We recently showed that the RMM proteins constitute two distinct sub-complexes, a Rec114–Mei4 heterotrimer and a Mer2 homotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). In vitro, both complexes undergo DNA-driven condensation independently and can mingle together to form mixed condensates. Condensation is a fundamental property of RMM proteins, and mutations that reduce DNA binding compromise condensation in vitro and meiotic DSB formation in vivo, suggesting that this activity is important for their biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). Hence, we proposed that RMM condensation organizes discrete chromatin sub-compartments within which DSB formation takes place. Nevertheless, little was known regarding the structures of Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 complexes, how they relate to their biological functions, and whether their structural and molecular properties are conserved.</p><p id="P5">Here, we address this using AlphaFold structural modeling, supported by biochemical and biophysical characterization. We show that Rec114–Mei4 and Mer2 complexes show similar architectures throughout eukaryotes and reveal mechanistic insights into their multivalent interactions with DNA that underlie the assembly of the DSB machinery by DNA-driven condensation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure of a minimal Rec114–Mei4 complex</title><p id="P6">Rec114 and Mei4 form a heterotrimeric complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry where the C-terminus of Rec114 homodimerizes and interacts with the N-terminus of Mei4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). We purified the Rec114 dimerization domain (residues 375-428) and a minimal trimeric Rec114–Mei4 complex (Mei4 residues 1-43). Thermal shift analyses revealed apparent melting temperatures of 74.5 ± 1.0 °C and 81.5 ± 0.9 °C for Rec114 and the Rec114–Mei4 complex, respectively, indicating that the presence of Mei4 stabilizes Rec114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the minimal Rec114–Mei4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>). This yielded a high-quality model showing two Rec114 α-helical chains (residues 399-426) cupping a Mei4 α-helix (residues 16-29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Quality assessment indicated high-confidence predictions of the folded regions and the relative orientations of the interacting domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To experimentally verify this structural model, we purified isotopically labeled U-[<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N] Rec114 and Rec114–Mei4 complexes, and studied the proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although NMR analyses did not allow us to determine the structure of the complexes <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2A</xref>), the data strongly support the AlphaFold models.</p><p id="P9">First, AlphaFold predicts that Rec114 and Mei4 peptides feature two α-helices preceded by N-terminal unstructured tails. This topology is confirmed by NMR chemical shift index analysis, which revealed a good agreement between the NMR and AlphaFold α-helical regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Second, the presence of Mei4 breaks the symmetry of the Rec114 dimer. This is clearly seen in the HSQC spectrum of the Rec114–Mei4 complex, where multiple Rec114 residues give rise to two backbone amide resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). This indicates that the same Rec114 amino acid experiences different chemical environments in the two protein chains. Mapping the differences in chemical shifts of the double Rec114 HSQC peaks shows that the largest effects are observed for the residues in the first α-helix (residues 399-407) and the C-terminal part of the protein (residues 423-428) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2C</xref>). Indeed, these are the Rec114 regions with the highest dissimilarity in the predicted structure of the complex, where residues in one protein chain interact with the C-terminal α-helix of Mei4 (residues 32-43), while the same groups in the other chain do not.</p><p id="P11">Third, we recorded and analyzed nuclear Overhauser effect spectra (NOESY), which allow to detect pairs of <sup>1</sup>H atoms lying in close spatial proximity (typically &lt; 5Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wüthrich 1986</xref>)). We successfully assigned a number of sidechain methyl and aromatic groups of both Rec114 and Mei4, which are buried in the core of the protein complex and, thus, can be used to detect specific residue-residue contacts. A set of well-resolved methyl resonances of Leu, Ile, Val, and Met, as well as aromatic protons of Trp and Phe, were inspected in NOESY spectra, which allowed identification of several key <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S2D</xref>). In total, 13 unambiguous NOEs were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). In particular, we observed contacts between residues in the same protein chain, interchain Rec114–Rec114 interactions, and several intermolecular Rec114–Mei4 contacts. Overall, the observed NOEs are fully consistent with the predicted structure and validate the AlphaFold model of the minimal heterotrimeric Rec114–Mei4 complex.</p><p id="P12">Next, we sought to test the model by mutagenesis. We previously showed that a Rec114 F411A mutation abolishes the interaction with Mei4 in yeast-two-hybrid and pulldown assays, and abolishes meiotic DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). The AlphaFold model indicates that the F411 residue points directly towards Mei4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, top), explaining these results. Based on the model, we selected for mutagenesis other residues located within the predicted interaction surface. Rec114 residues K405 and E419, and Mei4 residues E16 and D18 make strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, bottom). Alanine substitutions at these positions strongly lowered the aggregation temperature of the complex in a thermal shift assay, indicating that these residues indeed stabilize the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Model of full-length Mei4 bound to Rec114</title><p id="P13">Next, we examined the architecture of the full-length Rec114–Mei4 complex. Rec114 is predicted to have a long central intrinsically-disordered region (IDR) preceded by a structured N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). The N-terminal domain of <italic>M. musculus</italic> REC114 has been crystallized and shows a Pleckstrin Homology (PH)-like fold composed of an α-helix sandwiched between two antiparallel β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kumar et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boekhout et al. 2019</xref>). AlphaFold predicted with high confidence a similar structural fold for the yeast Rec114 N-terminal domain (residues 1-140) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S8A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In addition, AlphaFold prediction of full-length Mei4 revealed a structure composed of 19 α-helices, with the two N-terminal Rec114-binding helices pointing out of this ordered structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S3A-C</xref>). Analysis of the Mei4 structural fold using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Holm 2022</xref>) revealed similarities with HEAT-repeat proteins, including NOT1 (PDB 5FU7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Raisch et al. 2016</xref>), Cα RMSD of 3.7 Å over 202 residues) and CAND1 (PDB 4A0C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fischer et al. 2011</xref>), Cα RMSD of 3.5 Å over 172 residues). Typical HEAT repeats form an α-solenoid consisting of helix A-turn-helix B motifs arranged in tandem with a ~15° angle between the repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrade et al. 2001</xref>). Indeed, the predicted Mei4 structure comprises a core of four pairs of antiparallel helices stacked against each other, yielding a convex surface made of A helices and a concave surface made of B helices, similar to other HEAT-repeat structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, these are not assembled from canonical helix-turn-helix motifs, since two out of four pairs of antiparallel helices are interrupted by additional helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Hence, Mei4 has an atypical HEAT-repeat structure.</p><p id="P15">We used our published crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) data of Rec114–Mei4 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>) to test the predicted Mei4 structure. The dataset contains 690 intramolecular Mei4 crosslinks (44 distinct pairs). Most of the α-carbons of the crosslinked lysines were closer to each other than the crosslinkable limit of 27.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The five pairs of crosslinked residues that were significantly farther apart involved the N-terminal Rec114-interacting tail, which is presumably flexible. Hence, intramolecular Mei4 crosslinks strongly support the predicted structure.</p><p id="P16">We sought to model the interaction of the Rec114 C-terminal domain with full-length Mei4. To do this, we used the Rec114–Mei4 XL-MS data as distance restraints to calculate the lowest-energy structure for the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This revealed a binding geometry in which the Rec114 C-terminal dimer is docked on the concave side of Mei4, formed by HEAT-repeat B helices (α9, α12, α16, α19). The refined structure satisfies most of the abundant crosslinks (&gt;10 hits) of the XL-MS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S3D, E, Supplemental Table S2</xref>). AlphaFold predicted a similar arrangement, although with low confidence in the relative position of the Mei4 HEAT-repeat domain and Rec114–Mei4 interaction domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S3F-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Rec114–Mei4 heterotrimers have two duplex-DNA binding sites</title><p id="P17">DNA-dependent condensation by Rec114–Mei4 is likely driven by multivalent interactions with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, this could result in a binding preference for branched DNA substrates, where the branched substrate provides multiple protein-binding sites that can be occupied simultaneously and stabilize the nucleoprotein complex. Hence, a binding preference for branched DNA can be indicative of multivalent protein-DNA interactions.</p><p id="P18">To investigate this, we used a gel-shift assay to quantify the affinity of Rec114–Mei4 to different DNA structures assembled with synthetic oligonucleotides. We found that Rec114–Mei4 indeed binds preferentially to branched DNA substrates, compared to duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). This was confirmed in a competition assay, where a DNA substrate that mimics a Holliday Junction (HJ) was a ~10-fold better competitor than duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In addition, binding to duplex DNA leads to well-shifts, while binding to the branched substrates leads to complexes that can enter the gel.</p><p id="P19">To gain further insights into the DNA-binding properties of Rec114–Mei4, we examined whether the minimal trimeric complex also interacts preferentially with branched DNA substrates. Indeed, the minimal complex showed higher affinity for a HJ substrate compared to a duplex DNA in a competition experiment and a filter-binding assay, similar to full-length Rec114–Mei4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). Hence the minimal Rec114–Mei4 complex must have multiple DNA-binding sites.</p><p id="P20">We previously found that alanine mutations of Rec114 residues R395, K396, K399 and R400 (4KR) compromise the DNA-binding and condensation activities of Rec114–Mei4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). These residues form two patches of positively charged amino acids that face in opposite directions on the structural model, revealing two DNA-binding sites within the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). This geometrical arrangement indicates that the two sites could not be occupied simultaneously with the same B-form DNA substrate, which explains the preference for branched structures.</p><p id="P21">In addition, residues K403/K407 and K417/K424 also participate in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu et al. 2023</xref>). Residues K417 and K424 of one monomer contribute in <italic>trans</italic> to the DNA-binding surface composed of residues R395, K396, K399, R400, K403 and K407 (6KR) of the second monomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4A</xref>). Mutating the 6KR residues to alanine abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the minimal complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4B</xref>). However, these mutations do not completely abolish DNA binding by full-length Rec114–Mei4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4C, D</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>in vivo</italic>, alanine substitutions of K403/K407 and K417/K424 improve the spore viability of the <italic>rec114-4KR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4E</xref>). These data indicate that DNA binding by the heterotrimeric Rec114–Mei4 interaction domain is important, but not essential, and may participate in an unknown regulatory function of the complex.</p><p id="P22">To test the hypothesis that the two DNA-binding surfaces of Rec114–Mei4 drive condensation, we sought to specifically mutate one of the surfaces and establish the impact on DNA binding and condensation. To achieve this, we produced minimal complexes with two Rec114 subunits separated by a short flexible linker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4F, G</xref>). The fusion construct retained wild-type DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4H</xref>). Next, we mutated one of the two DNA-binding sites within the complex. As expected, the single-sided mutants retained some DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S4I</xref>), but condensation was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I-K</xref>). Thus, the two DNA-binding surfaces of Rec114–Mei4 drive condensation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural model of Mer2 homotetramers</title><p id="P23">Mer2 has a central coiled-coil domain that tetramerizes, flanked by N- and C-terminal disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We previously proposed that the coiled coil is assembled as pairs of parallel α-helices arranged in an antiparallel configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Claeys Bouuaert et al. 2021</xref>). To gain further insights, we used AlphaFold to predict the structure of a tetrameric Mer2 coiled-coil domain (residues 41-224). Surprisingly, AlphaFold generated with high confidence a parallel tetrameric model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To assess this structural arrangement, we purified HisSUMO-tagged and untagged truncations of Mer2 and determined their molecular masses (MW) by size exclusion chromatography followed by multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S6</xref>). The Mer2 coiled coil and the C-terminal half alone (residues 138-224) form tetramers, which is not compatible with a parallel-antiparallel model (hereafter ‘antiparallel’). However, further truncating the C-terminal part of the coiled coil (residues 161-224) gives an apparent molecular weight that corresponds to a trimer, suggesting that the tetramer is unstable and partially dissociates during the chromatography. In addition, the N-terminal half of the coiled coil (residues 41-136) yields a molecular weight that corresponds to a dimer, while further truncating the N-terminal yields a monomer, indicating that the packing of the coiled-coil N-terminus is less stable than that of the C-terminus.</p><p id="P25">Analysis of the predicted structure using Twister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Strelkov and Burkhard 2002</xref>) identified about 20 heptad repeats interrupted by six stutters (insertion of 4 amino acids) and one skip (+1) located between residues 80 and 168 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S13A</xref>). The AlphaFold model predicts geometrical distortions of the coiled coil in the vicinity of the stutters, which are mostly compensated by local unwinding of the coiled coil, with a local shift to a right-handed geometry. In addition, the model shows a wide coiled-coil radius around residues 120-150, which is indicative of sub-optimal hydrophobic packing of the coiled coil, resulting in a less stable structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S13B</xref>).

To do this, we analyzed a HisSUMO-tagged Mer2 coiled-coil domain by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Reporting on the overall molecular shape in solution, SAXS provides a means to discriminate between the parallel (all fusion domains on the same side of the coiled coil) and the antiparallel (fusion domains at both ends) topologies. SAXS scattering curves were in excellent agreement with the profile expected for a parallel coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

After 5 min at room temperature, condensation was induced by threefold dilution in reaction buffer containing DNA and no salt, to reach final 15-μl reactions that contained 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% PEG 8000. A typical binding reaction contained 150 ng supercoiled pUC19 (5.7 nM) and 4 μM Alexa488-labeled Rec114<sup>(375-428)</sup>–Mei4<sup>(1-43)</sup>. After 30 minutes incubation at 30 °C with occasional mixing, 4 μl was dropped on a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. Images were captured on Zeiss Axio observer with a 100×/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Images were analyzed with ImageJ using a custom-made script. In brief, a fixed threshold was applied to a 129.24 × 129.24-μm (2048 × 2048-pixel) images. The intensity inside the foci mask was integrated.

The intermolecular XL-MS data were converted into pairwise distance restraints between lysine sidechains as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gong et al. 2020</xref>). In all refinement runs, the position of the core Rec114–Mei4 minimal complex (residues 399-426 of Rec114 and 16-42 of Mei4) was kept fixed; Mei4 globular domain (residues 65-401) treated as a rigid body group; while the intervening linkers, N- and C-terminal tails of both proteins, and sidechains of crosslinked lysines given full torsional degree of freedom. The computational protocol comprised an initial simulated annealing step followed by the side-chain energy minimization. The total minimized energy function consisted of the standard geometric (bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers) and steric (van der Waals) terms, a knowledge-based dihedral angle potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schwieters et al. 2003</xref>) and the experimental XL-MS restraints term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gong et al. 2020</xref>). In each refinement run, 100 structures were calculated and 10 lowest-energy solutions – representing the best agreement with the experimental data – retained for the subsequent analysis. To model the DNA-bound Rec114–Mei4 complex, we generated the double helical structure of the canonical Watson-Crick paired B-DNA (20-bp oligomer 5’-GAGATGTCCATGGACATCTC-3’), and docked two copies of the DNA duplex to the best structure of the XL-MS refined Rec114–Mei4 complex. The model was obtained by minimizing the distance between the DNA-binding Rec114 residues R395, K396, K399, and R400 and the central grooves of the double-stranded DNA oligomer, while avoiding steric clashes between protein sidechains and the DNA. The resulting model shows the DNA-bound Rec114–Mei4 complex, where Rec114 residues R395, K396, K399, and R400 make a number of intermolecular contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone and nucleotide bases.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Twister analysis of predicted coiled-coil structures</title><p id="P85">AlphaFold predicted coiled-coil structures were analyzed using Twister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Strelkov and Burkhard 2002</xref>). A coiled coil can be described by the radius and pitch (i.e., distance along the axis that corresponds to a full turn) of the superhelix, and the radius and pitch of the α-helices. In addition, the pitch of the coiled coil and the α-helices can be expressed per residue (phase yield). Analyses of the coiled-coil and the α-helical phase yields reveal whether the coiled coil and/or the individual helices are locally distorted. Analyses of coiled-coil left and right pitch parameters reveal whether the normally left-handed coiled coil locally switches to a right-handed superhelix. Finally, Crick’s angle describes the position of a specific residue relative to the axis of the coiled coil. Variations in Crick’s angles between residues that occupy equivalent positions (e.g., a or d) further indicates geometrical distortions of the coiled coil.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>SEC-SAXS</title><p id="P86">All experiments were performed at the SOLEIL BioSAXS beamline SWING (Gif-sur-Yvette, France).

(F) AFM imaging of full-length Mer2 (100 nM) or the coiled-coil domain (100 nM) in the presence of 1 nM plasmid DNA (pUC19).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158921-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Conservation of Rec114–Mei4 structure and DNA-binding properties.</title><p>(A) AlphaFold models of minimal trimeric complexes for Rec114–Mei4 orthologs in <italic>M. musculus</italic> (REC114–MEI4), <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Rec7–Rec24), <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (PHS1–PRD2), and <italic>Z. mays</italic> (PHS1–MPS1). The position of the conserved phenylalanine at the interface between Rec114 and Mei4 orthologs is shown (pink). Other residues mutated in panel B are shown in grey. (B) Pulldown analysis of the effect of <italic>M. musculus</italic> REC114 F230A, F240A, and F243A mutations on the interaction with MEI4. Error bars are ranges from three replicates. (C) Competition assay of tagged mouse REC114–MEI4 complex (1000 nM) binding to a fluorescent HJ substrate (10 nM) in the presence of unlabeled dsDNA or HJ substrates. The band labeled ‘*Bound’ migrates close to the position of the unbound substrate. It is likely due to the rapid dissociation of REC114–MEI4 from the substrate at the start of the electrophoresis. Error bars are ranges from two independent experiments (most are too small to be visible).
