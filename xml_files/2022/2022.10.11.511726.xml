Despite evidence of clinical efficacy, there remains scope to improve upon the therapeutic window of the current generation of AKT inhibitors. Here we report the development of a second-generation AKT degrader, INY-05-040, which outperformed catalytic AKT inhibition with respect to cellular suppression of AKT-driven phenotypes in breast cancer cell lines. A systematic growth inhibition screen across 288 cancer cell lines confirmed a substantially higher potency for INY-05-040 (median GI50<sub>adj</sub> = 1.1 µM) compared to our first-generation AKT degrader (INY-03-041; median GI50<sub>adj</sub> = 3.1 µM), with both compounds outperforming catalytic AKT inhibition with GDC-0068 (median GI50<sub>adj</sub> &gt; 10 µM). Using multi-omic profiling and causal network integration in breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that the enhanced efficacy of INY-05-040 is associated with sustained suppression of AKT signaling, followed by a potent induction of the stress mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Further integration of growth inhibition assays with publicly available transcriptomic, proteomic, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) measurements established low baseline JNK signaling as a biomarker for breast cancer sensitivity to AKT degradation. Collectively, our study presents a systematic framework for mapping the network-wide signaling effects of therapeutically relevant compounds, and identifies INY-05-040 as a potent pharmacological suppressor of AKT signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT network has a fundamental role in the integration of extracellular growth stimuli to regulate cell metabolism, migration, proliferation, and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Aberrant activation of this network is widespread in human cancers, particularly those of the female reproductive system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Numerous therapies targeting PI3K/AKT pathway components have been developed and evaluated for their potential as cancer therapeutics, and some have been clinically approved, including the PI3Kα-specific inhibitor alpelisib (PIQRAY®) for ER+/HER2- breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Because of its central role in mediating PI3K signaling and frequent hyperactivation across cancer types, the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT has become an attractive therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Several drugs targeting AKT have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials, including ATP-competitive, allosteric, and covalent pan-AKT inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These inhibitors have yet to be approved for the treatment of cancer. Despite promising outcomes in some phase II and ongoing phase III clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, there is scope to improve the therapeutic window of available AKT-targeting compounds. Importantly, conventional AKT inhibitors are largely cytostatic, not cytotoxic, thus failing to eradicate cancer cells as monotherapies. Consequently, there is an unmet need to identify more potent AKT-targeting drugs, in addition to uncovering cellular mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of AKT inhibition.</p><p id="P5">Recently, targeted protein degradation using small molecule degraders, also called <underline>PRO</underline>teolysis <underline>TA</underline>rgeting <underline>C</underline>himeras (PROTACs), has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality and as a tool for the chemical depletion of proteins of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In many cases, PROTACs display increased selectivity over the inhibitors from which they are designed, which presents advantages in limiting off-target toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Targeted protein degradation can also be used as a tool to understand network rewiring dynamics following near-complete and relatively acute depletion of the protein of interest. Potent and selective AKT-targeting PROTACs have been developed, with improved selectivity and potency over parental AKT inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here, we report the development of a second-generation AKT degrader, INY-05-040, that selectively and rapidly (&lt;5 h) degrades all three AKT isoforms, and inhibits downstream signaling and cell proliferation across a panel of 288 cancer cell lines. Using a multi-omics approach, combined with computational network modeling and experimental validation, we uncovered several degrader-selective cellular phenotypes in breast cancer cells, including potent activation of the stress mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). Additional breast cancer cell line analyses revealed that a signature of baseline JNK1 activation predicts lower sensitivity to AKT degradation, suggesting a novel biomarker for future therapeutic stratification.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>INY-05-040 is an improved, second-generation AKT degrader</title><p id="P7">We previously reported the development of an AKT-targeting degrader INY-03-041, a heterobifunctional degrader consisting of the catalytic AKT inhibitor GDC-0068 chemically linked to the Cereblon (CRBN) recruiter lenalidomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Despite the potency and selectivity of INY-03-041, this degrader exhibited relatively slow (12 h) cellular degradation kinetics of all three AKT isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore developed an improved, second-generation AKT degrader, INY-05-040, consisting of GDC-0068 chemically conjugated to a Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ligand via a ten-hydrocarbon linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To generate the matched negative control compound INY-05-040-Neg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), we incorporated a diastereoisomer of the VHL ligand that substantially loses activity towards VHL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The biochemical selectivity of INY-050-040 was comparable to GDC-0068 across a panel of 468 kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Proteomic analysis in the T lymphoblast cell line MOLT4, chosen due to expression of all three AKT isoforms, confirmed pan-AKT downregulation following 4-h treatment with 250 nM INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">All subsequent evaluation of INY-05-040 was performed in human breast cancer cell lines, due to the high prevalence of PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Exposure of the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and <italic>PIK3CA<sup>H1047R</sup></italic>-mutant T47D cell line to increasing doses of INY-050-040 for 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>), or over a time course using a dose of 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>), revealed a substantially improved dose- and time-dependent reduction in total AKT levels compared to the first-generation degrader, INY-03-041. This was mirrored by potent suppression of downstream PRAS40 (T246) and S6 (S240/S244) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B, 1C</xref>). INY-05-040 also outperformed GDC-0068 in T47D cells treated for 24 h, with &gt;500 nM of GDC-0068 required to achieve comparable signaling suppression to that achieved with 50-100 nM INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). As GDC-0068 is also a component of the negative control compound, INY-05-040-Neg, the latter suppressed signaling at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), as expected. Importantly, unlike non-covalent, catalytic inhibition of AKT with GDC-0068, INY-05-040 treatment of T47D resulted in sustained AKT reduction and suppression of downstream signaling for at least 72 h following compound washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Consistent with proteasome-dependent degradation, pharmacological abrogation of proteasomal function or neddylation prevented AKT degradation by INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>). We replicated these experiments in the <italic>PTEN</italic>-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-468 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D, S1E, S1F, S1G</xref>), demonstrating that the favorable cellular properties of INY-05-040 are generalizable across breast cancer cell lineages. Notably, cells exposed to INY-05-040 also exhibited reduced levels of total ribosomal S6 protein, observed within the first 24 h of treatment as well as after compound wash-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, 1D, 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). Consistent with long-term suppression of AKT signaling, both first- and second-generation AKT degraders caused potent suppression of cell growth across four different breast cancer cell lines, at doses well below those required for an equivalent response with catalytic or allosteric AKT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H, S1I</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Furthermore, we tested the pharmacodynamic properties of AKT degraders in vivo, using a BT-474C breast cancer xenograft model. Following 4-day-treatment, both first- (INY-03-041) and second-generation (INY-05-040) degraders caused potent reduction in pan-AKT levels, accompanied by downregulation of pPRAS40 (T246) and pS6 (S240/244) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Likely due to incomplete AKT degradation in vivo, the observed suppression of downstream signaling was equivalent to that observed with GDC-0068.</p><p id="P10">Taken together, these results show that INY-05-040 is a potent AKT degrader and inhibitor of downstream signaling output, outperforming both our first-generation AKT degrader and GDC-0068.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Multi-omic profiling reveals AKT degrader-selective responses</title><p id="P11">To identify mechanisms unique to AKT degradation relative to catalytic inhibition, we performed mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) in T47D breast cancer cells, treated with the respective compounds for 5 or 10 h. To limit the confounding effect of differential potency, we determined the doses of INY-05-040 (100 nM) and GDC-0068 (500 nM) that would result in comparable suppression of downstream signaling at these time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). All studies were performed using nutrient- and growth factor-replete cell culture media.</p><p id="P12">Consistent with a shared target, the transcriptomes of GDC-0068- and INY-05-040-treated cells clustered closely together, separate from DMSO- and INY-05-040-Neg-treated controls, according to an unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In agreement with the slower onset of AKT degradation, 5-h treatment with INY-05-040 resulted in differential abundance of only 194 transcripts (100 decreased, 94 increased; absolute fold-change ≥ 1.3), compared to 511 transcripts (249 decreased, 262 increased) with GDC-0068 during the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). By contrast, after 10 h, INY-05-040 caused differential abundance of 1394 transcripts (626 decreased, 768 increased; absolute fold-change ≥ 1.3), whereas the extent of GDC-0068-induced transcriptional changes remained stable at 543 transcripts (243 decreased; 300 increased) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Across all differentially expressed transcripts after 10-h treatment, more than 700 were unique to INY-05-040, compared to less than 100 unique changes for GDC-0068 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A, S3B</xref>). No differential abundance was observed in response to treatment with the control compound, INY-05-040-Neg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We next conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the HALLMARK gene signature collection provided by the Broad Institute Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. At 10 h, both INY-05-040 and GDC-0068 triggered a transcriptional footprint consistent with suppression of the cell cycle, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, mTORC1 and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>). Although 5-h treatment with GDC-0068 resulted in a larger number of distinct gene signatures with positive enrichment scores, most of these no longer reached statistical significance after 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting emerging adaptation to catalytic AKT inhibition. After 10-h treatment, positively enriched gene signatures were largely shared between degrader and catalytic inhibitor, but the underlying gene expression shifts were often more robust following AKT degradation, as evidenced by higher statistical significance despite equivalent sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>). Examples include gene signatures related to apoptosis, inflammatory signaling (including TNFα/NFκB) and the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next used DoRothEA, a transcriptional footprint-based method featuring a curated gene regulatory network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, to predict differences in transcription factor (TF) regulation between INY-05-040 and GDC-0068 at 10 h. Overall, TF activity predictions were highly concordant between the two compounds, with two notable exceptions. The lipid and sterol metabolism-regulating transcription factors, SREBP1 and SREBP2, were predicted as strongly inhibited upon catalytic AKT inhibition but not AKT degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). A correlation analysis across the previously generated HALLMARK gene signature enrichments revealed a similar discordance with respect to cholesterol homeostasis and androgen response signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Of note, these two signatures share four transcripts related to lipid and cholesterol synthesis: <italic>SCD, IDI1, HMGCR, HMGCS1</italic>. Both <italic>HMGCR</italic> and <italic>HMGCS1</italic> belong to the list of SREBP1 and SREBP2 targets whose mRNA levels were increased upon 10-h treatment with INY-05-040 but not GDC-0068 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">These findings were further supported by results from precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), performed after 5-h exposure of T47D cells to INY-05-040 or GDC-0068. PRO-seq allows mapping of RNA polymerase active sites with base-pair resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and changes in the expression of a transcript reflects immediate differences in active transcription, unlike RNAseq which captures steady-state mRNA levels. Similar to the bulk transcriptomes, PRO-seq datasets from degrader- and GDC-0068-treated samples clustered together and away from DMSO-treated controls by PCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). A substantially higher number of genes were differentially transcribed in response to AKT degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E, S3F</xref>), with further functional enrichment analyses supporting transcriptional regulation of SREBP1/2 and cholesterol homeostasis as defining differences between AKT degradation <italic>versus</italic> catalytic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, 2H</xref>). Such activation of SREBP1 and SREBP2, despite potent AKT/mTORC1 inhibition, would be most consistent with a phenotype of cholesterol depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Given evidence for altered metabolic homeostasis, we next assessed the metabolic profile of T47D cells treated with INY-05-040 and GDC-0068. For comparison, we also included an allosteric (MK-2206) and a second catalytic (AZD 5363) inhibitor. Treatments were performed for 24 h to allow capture of robust and persistent changes, while minimizing the signaling rebound seen with GDC-0068 upon continuous treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). LC-MS-based metabolomics of 9 cultures per treatment, spanning 3 independent experiments, showed that AKT degradation caused the largest number of differentially abundant metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Many metabolite changes were shared across all AKT-targeting compounds, especially MK-2206 and AZD 5363. Several nucleosides and their phosphorylated derivatives had increased in abundance, including inosine, guanosine, IMP, GMP, AMP and CMP. Metabolite changes unique to treatment with INY-05-040 included intermediates of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutathione and cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Notably, only AKT degradation caused increased levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA), which is known to act as a potent inhibitor of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme, HMGCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and accumulates if vitamin B12 levels are too low relative to the catabolism of branched chain amino acids and odd chain fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Taken together, this multi-omic approach supports a widespread perturbation of cellular homeostasis in breast cancer cells treated with INY-05-040, with unique responses to AKT degradation pertaining to cholesterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Causal Oriented Search of Multi-Omic Space (COSMOS) identifies altered stress MAPK signaling downstream of AKT degradation</title><p id="P18">We next reasoned that an integrated, trans-omic integration of the previous datasets may enable us to generate testable mechanistic hypotheses regarding previously unknown signaling changes downstream of AKT degradation. We applied a network analysis approach, COSMOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets following treatment with AKT degrader INY-05-040 or GDC-0068 for 10 h and 24 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Briefly, COSMOS relies on an extensive prior knowledge network (PKN) of signaling pathways, transcriptional regulation and metabolic reactions, in combination with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization strategy to identify the smallest coherent subnetwork causally connecting as many deregulated TFs and metabolites in the input data as possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Input data to COSMOS consisted of the background transcriptome of T47D cells, in addition to treatment-specific DoRothEA-derived TF activity predictions and differentially abundant metabolites. The resulting networks enable identification of top degree signaling nodes, i.e. “hubs”, which are essential for holding a network together due to their high number of connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Replicate COSMOS runs identified MAPK1 (ERK2) and/or MAPK3 (ERK1) as top degree nodes in both INY-05-040 and GDC-0068 networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A, S5B</xref>), consistent with the known compensatory RAS/MAPK signaling activation that follows potent PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Focusing on unique differences, we noted that the stress MAPKs, MAPK8 (JNK1) and MAPK14 (p38α), were among the top degree nodes in the INY-05-040-specific networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). MAPK14 was identified as a top degree node in 10 out of 11 COSMOS runs with INY-05-040 input data but was never a top degree node in any of the eight COSMOS runs performed with GDC-0068 input data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, 3C</xref>). In two out of eight GDC-0068-specific networks, MAPK14 was not part of the final network; in the remaining six, it featured with a maximum of two connections per network, suggesting a minor role for this kinase in the cellular response to GDC-0068.</p><p id="P19">To corroborate these findings, we next retrieved all MSigDb curated gene sets (C2 collection) featuring transcriptional changes downstream of JNK/p38 perturbation and performed GSEA using the RNAseq dataset. Three gene signatures related to TNFα signaling were positively and significantly enriched in INY-05-040-treated T47D cells after 10 h, with two of the signatures representing transcriptional changes that are either completely or partially dependent on p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These signatures originated from a study examining the response of lung cancer cells to TNFα in the presence or absence of the pan-p38 inhibitor LY479754<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Only one of the two p38-dependent signatures were significantly enriched for with a positive score in GDC-0068-treated cells; however, neither the significance nor the magnitude of enrichment were as strong as that observed in INY-05-040-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). This is also consistent with a much weaker enrichment of the hallmark gene signature “TNFA_signaling_via_NFκB” in response to 10-h treatment with GDC-0068 compared to INY-05-40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>).

Consistently, AKT degradation resulted in more robust stress MAPK signaling induction, supporting COSMOS-based predictions.</p><p id="P21">Among the different breast cancer cell lines examined, we found that the ER-positive cell line, BT-474, exhibited a near-binary difference in stress MAPK activation in response to AKT degradation compared to catalytic inhibition. Following 48-h treatment with INY-05-040 but not GDC-0068, BT-474 cells exhibited strong induction of p-cJun (S73) and cJun, which was sustained for at least 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We hypothesized that induction of stress MAPK signaling contributes to AKT degrader-associated cytotoxicity. To test this, BT-474 and T47D cells were pre-treated with a low-dose (50 nM) of the covalent JNK1/2/3 inhibitor JNK-IN-8 for 24 h, followed by the addition of either GDC-0068 or INY-05-040 for another 120 h. The two cell lines were chosen as models for a potent (BT-474) versus low (T47D) cytotoxic response to AKT degradation, while both had a substantially lower magnitude of GDC-0068-induced cell death. Consistently, the INY-05-040-induced cytotoxic response in T47D cells was fully neutralized by JNK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In BT-474, however, combined AKT degradation and JNK inhibition only led to a small, partial rescue of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>); the increased levels of cleaved-PARP, a marker of apoptosis, in BT-474 cells treated with AKT degrader were also not reduced by co-treatment with JNK-IN-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>). We therefore conclude that acute and sustained stress MAPK activation is a marker of potent suppression of AKT signaling downstream of INY-05-040, but that this mechanism is not sufficient to explain the cytotoxic effect of AKT degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Global cell line screening identifies stress MAPK-associated resistance biomarkers</title><p id="P22">Given the improved cellular potency of INY-05-040, including robust downstream transcriptional and metabolic changes, we next undertook global cancer cell line profiling to determine whether INY-05-040 causes more potent growth suppression relative to GDC-0068 and the first-generation AKT degrader INY-03-041. Across 288 cancer cell lines, spanning a total of 18 different cancer lineages, INY-05-040 exhibited superior growth-inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). This was based on calculation of the drug concentration required to reduce overall growth by 50 % (GI50adj, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), which includes adjustment for cell number at the start of the assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Notably, while GI50adj calculation was possible for all cell lines treated with the second-generation degrader, and for 282 cell lines treated with the first-generation degrader, this was not possible for 161 cell lines treated with GDC-0068 due to lack of sufficient growth suppression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). Consequently, the median GI50adj value for GDC-0068 in our screen is higher than 10 µM, compared to 1.1 µM for INY-05-040 and 3.1 µM for INY-03-041.</p><p id="P23">To identify functional biomarkers predictive of sensitivity to INY-05-040 in the 21 breast cancer cell lines profiled, we took advantage of the measured GI50adj values and the corresponding baseline transcriptomic, proteomic and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data publicly available through the Cancer Dependency Map project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We classified breast cancer cells into sensitive, intermediate, and resistant if the measured GI50adj was less than 0.5 µM, between 0.5 to 1 µM, and higher than 1 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>), respectively. Subsequent unsupervised PCA using either transcriptomic or proteomic datasets revealed a notable separation of INY-04-050-sensitive <italic>versus</italic> -resistant breast cancer cells, which was not simply driven by ER expression as assessed by PAM50 status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Except for one mixed-subtype HER2-amplified-luminal breast cancer cell line (DU4475), all examined HER2-amplified and luminal breast cancer cells were sensitive to INY-05-040. This was also observed for 4 out of 5 breast cancer cells belonging to the basal A subtype. By contrast, only 1 out of 6 basal B breast cancer cell lines were sensitive to INY-05-040, with 4 out of 6 exhibiting overt resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Using the PC1 loadings from the transcriptomic and proteomic data, we then correlated these to the measured GI50adj values. This revealed strong and statistically significant correlations for either comparison, with higher PC1 loadings associated with higher GI50adj values and thus resistance to INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, 5D</xref>). To identify the underlying molecular features, we performed GSEA on the two PC1 loadings (transcriptomic and proteomic data). Gene sets that were positively enriched for alongside either PC1 were highly concordant and characterized by strong enrichment for epithelial mesenchymal transition and inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Strikingly, most of these positive enrichments overlapped with those observed upon acute 10-h treatment of T47D breast cancer cells with INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Based on our mechanistic data on acute JNK activation and sensitivity to INY-05-040, we reasoned that the correlation between inflammatory gene signatures and INY-05-040 resistance in the breast cancer cell panel may reflect an already high baseline JNK activation and thus stress MAPK signaling. Accordingly, we found that both <italic>JNK1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>), JNK1 phosphorylation (T183/187) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>) and cJun phosphorylation (S73) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>) exhibited a positive and statistically significant correlation with INY-05-040 GI50adj values. Importantly, the BT-474 breast cancer cell line, which exhibits a cytotoxic response to INY-05-040 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), had the lowest GI50adj value and the lowest values for markers of baseline JNK1 activation.</p><p id="P25">Taken together, these data demonstrate superior potency of INY-05-040-induced AKT degradation over catalytic inhibition across cancer cell lines, with low baseline levels of stress MAPK signaling correlating with heightened AKT degrader sensitivity in breast cancer cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Targeted protein degradation has emerged as both a novel therapeutic approach and a powerful experimental tool to evaluate the effects of acute protein depletion on cellular networks. Here we have reported the development of a potent and highly selective second-generation pan-AKT degrader, INY-05-040, which we used as a tool to uncover novel AKT biology. Using a multi-omic approach in breast cancer cell models, we found that AKT degradation led to unique transcriptomic and metabolomic changes, strong suppression of downstream AKT signaling, concomitant with potent activation of stress MAPK signaling. Furthermore, low baseline levels of JNK activation were associated with increased sensitivity to AKT degradation across a panel of breast cancer cell lines.</p><p id="P27">The ongoing search for targeted agents to treat patients with PI3K pathway hyperactivation has focused on the identification of more selective compounds, effective combinations to limit toxicity and improvements in patient selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Recent efforts have led to the development of the PI3Kα-selective inhibitor alpelisib (PIQRAY®), approved for the treatment of advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, in combination with the ER antagonist fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Despite this progress, both cancers and diseases of PI3K pathway activation urgently need an expansion of available treatment options to address issues of resistance and/or poor tolerability. Independent lines of evidence, including the current study, indicate that targeted protein degradation of PI3K pathway components may represent a novel therapeutic strategy, with the added benefit of sustained inhibition of downstream signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. This property may partly be explained by the inability of various negative feedback mechanisms within the PI3K/AKT pathway to overcome inhibition when a critical downstream transducer is absent. Prolonged cellular stress can also suppress AKT/mTORC1 activity, alongside a more complete shutdown of protein translation, which may contribute to a self-sustained feedforward loop of continued suppression of AKT signaling despite removal of the AKT degrader. This hypothesis is supported by washout experiments in which pathway reactivation was not observed or remained low for at least 72 h after degrader removal, in stark contrast to the corresponding findings with catalytic AKT inhibition with GDC-0068.</p><p id="P28">Using a network biology framework, COSMOS, we demonstrate how systematic integration of a prior knowledge with context-specific transcriptomic and metabolomic data can be used to identify and subsequently test mechanistic hypotheses on AKT degradation-selective signaling outcomes.

The observed quantitative differences would have been challenging to resolve with conventional approaches, emphasizing the power of computational integration of multi-omics data and temporal analyses.</p><p id="P29">We posit that both the duration and intensity of AKT pathway inhibition is critical for eliciting the potent stress MAPK response observed with INY-05-040. At present, the precise mechanistic link between AKT degradation and stress MAPK activation remains undescribed. We speculate that ribosomal stress may contribute to the induction of stress MAPKs, since AKT and mTORC1 promote ribosome biogenesis through transcriptional and translational mechanisms. Conversely, disruption of any given step in ribosome biogenesis has been shown to cause ribosomal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Accordingly, AKT degradation but not catalytic inhibition led to a potent and sustained reduction in total ribosomal S6 protein, which would be consistent with the low stability of ribosomal proteins in the absence of functional ribosome formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">Aberrant cholesterol metabolism may also contribute to the cellular stress observed upon AKT degradation.

The observation that the same transcriptional and signaling signatures induced upon degrader treatment of T47D cells are already elevated at baseline in breast cancer cell lines with lower sensitivity to INY-04-050 suggests that low baseline stress MAPK and inflammatory signaling activity may be a pre-requisite for potent cell growth suppression upon AKT degradation.</p><p id="P32">Several other AKT degraders have been developed to date, including the VHL-recruiting AZD5363-based AKT degrader MS21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

Briefly, the algorithm relies on CARNIVAL’s Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization, which was rerun multiple times for each dataset to determine the most consistent network predictions. Settings for each run, including the resulting network gap values, are provided in an accompanying table on the OSF project page. Differences included explicit indication of AKT1/2 inhibition (AKT3 was not expressed in T47D cells) as well as shuffling of individual <italic>t</italic> values for the background transcriptome, thus artificially forcing the solver to initiate the optimization from different starting points.</p><p id="P74">A “forward” optimization run to connect deregulated transcription factors (“signaling” input) as starting points to metabolites was performed first, followed by a “backward” optimization run connecting metabolites to signaling components. These optimization runs were used as the basis for the actual forward and final runs defining the output of the algorithm. Time limits for solving were set empirically, ensuring that the gap values of the resulting networks were ≤ 5% (indicative of a good fit). This was achieved for all runs except for one backward run (gap = 9.68%) using GDC-0068 input data.
