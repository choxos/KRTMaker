common type of dementia, characterised by pathological accumulation of extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that mainly consist of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, respectively. Previous studies in mouse models with a targeted knock-out of the microtubule-associated protein tau <italic>(Mapt)</italic> gene demonstrated that Aβ-driven toxicity is tau-dependent. However, human cellular models with chronic tau lowering remain unstudied.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P4">In this study, we generated stable tau-depleted human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) isogenic panels from two healthy individuals using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We then differentiated these iPSCs into cortical neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> in co-culture with primary rat cortical astrocytes before conducting electrophysiological and imaging experiments for a wide range of disease-relevant phenotypes. Both AD brain derived and recombinant Aβ were used in this study to elicit toxic responses from the iPSC-derived cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">We showed that tau depletion in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons caused considerable reductions in neuronal activity without affecting synaptic density. We also observed neurite outgrowth impairments in two of the tau-depleted lines used. We found axonal transport of mitochondria, mitochondrial function, and cortical neuron differentiation propensity remained unaffected regardless of tau expression levels. Finally, tau depletion protected neurons from adverse effects mitigating the impact of exogenous Aβ-induced hyperactivity, deficits in retrograde axonal transport of mitochondria, and neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P6">Our study established stable human iPSC isogenic panels with chronic tau depletion from two healthy individuals. Cortical neurons derived from these iPSC lines showed that tau is essential in Aβ-driven hyperactivity, axonal transport deficits, and neurodegeneration, consistent with studies conducted in <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mouse models. These findings highlight the protective effects of chronic tau lowering strategies in AD pathogenesis and reinforce the potential in clinical settings. The tau-depleted human iPSC models can now be applied at scale to investigate the involvement of tau in disease-relevant pathways and cell types.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P7">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease and cause of dementia, and is characterised by pathological accumulations of two key proteins – amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau – in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Accumulation of tau and Aβ remains the key pathology specific to AD as set out by the latest biological definition of AD in research from a National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association working group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), although recent advances in research have identified additional systems, cell types and molecular changes that are involved in AD pathogenesis. However, the precise link between Aβ, tau and eventual neurodegeneration remains only partially understood.</p><p id="P8">Over the past few decades, researchers have shown in longitudinal studies that Aβ accumulation precedes tau pathology in AD brains and that AD brain-derived soluble Aβ induces tau hyperphosphorylation which precedes tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Furthermore, disease-causing mutations in familial AD are associated with proteins involved in the pathway of Aβ production i.e., amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, leading to the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). To investigate how tau fits into this hypothesis, mouse models with a targeted knock-out of the microtubule-associated protein tau <italic>(Mapt)</italic> gene have been used to demonstrate that Aβ-driven toxicity is tau-dependent as reported in studies examining neuronal activity, axonal transport, and neurodegeneration, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mice are viable and do not present overt cognitive or behavioural deficits, although certain strains were reported to suffer from neurite outgrowth impairment and age-dependent motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Even though mouse models have been integral in elucidating mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, distinct biological differences remain between human and mouse in the context of AD. Aged mice do not develop AD pathology without the introduction of disease-causing mutations indicating a different disease susceptibility as compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Even with the introduction of mutations found in familial AD cases, AD mouse models do not present with tau pathology as would be the case for typical AD pathological manifestation. One important difference between human and mouse biology is that only four-repeat tau isoforms, representing approximately half of all tau isoforms in a human brain, are expressed in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). It is therefore imperative to assess the role of tau in the context of Aβ-driven toxicity in a human neuronal model in addition to studies involving mouse models. However, human <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> cell lines have not been studied in detail to better understand tau-dependent AD pathophysiology in a human genetic background.</p><p id="P10">Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a versatile human cell model which can be differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into almost any cell type, including neurons which are normally inaccessible without invasive surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). iPSCs can be genetically modified to represent a genotype of interest <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we generated stable <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> iPSC lines from two healthy individuals by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated gene editing. These iPSC lines were differentiated into cortical neurons and were examined for the effects of tau depletion in phenotypes that included neuronal activity, synapse loss, axonal transport, neurite outgrowth and neurodegeneration. We found that tau depletion caused significant reduction in neuronal activity but protected iPSC-derived cortical neurons from Aβ-driven neuronal hyperactivity, axonal transport deficits, and neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and materials</title><p id="P11">All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck), and all cell cultures were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator unless stated otherwise.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Generation MAPT-/- iPSC lines using CRISPR-Cas9</title><p id="P12">Two strategies targeting either Exon 1 or Exon 4 of the <italic>MAPT</italic> gene were employed in two separate previously published iPSC lines derived from dermal fibroblasts from healthy individuals: SBAd-03-01 (Exon 1 targeted; 31 years old female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>); <italic>APOE ε2/ε3</italic>); and SFC856-03-04 (Exon 4 targeted; 76 years old female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>); <italic>APOE ε3/ε4</italic>). The genetic manipulations of <italic>MAPT</italic> gene were achieved by using an Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 System (Integrated DNA Technologies) following manufacturer’s protocol. The Cas9 Nuclease V3 was used with a single gRNA to result in a double-stranded break in Exon 1, whereas Exon 4 was targeted with a pair of gRNAs to create a 25 bp excision (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To deliver hybridised Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein into the iPSCs, a Neon Transfection System (Thermo) was used to transfect a suspension of 220,000 iPSCs with a single pulse at 1400 V with 20 ms pulse width. The transfected iPSCs were then plated onto one well of a 24-well plate for recovery until the cells became confluent. Thereafter, the cells were singularised before plating 2,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cell line CF1. Ninety-six individual iPSC colonies were subsequently picked and transferred separately into a 96-well plate before they achieved confluence and were lysed for DNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Identification of two panels of isogenic MAPT-/- iPSC lines</title><p id="P13">Genomic DNA was extracted from each iPSC colony using a commercial kit (Qiagen), before the DNA samples were amplified using the BigDye™ v3.1 reagent and sequenced with primers targeting either Exon 1 or Exon 4 spanning the gRNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Before sending the DNA samples (10 μL per iPSC clone) for sequencing, samples were precipitated by adding 2 μL of 125 mM EDTA, 2 μL of 3 M sodium acetate and 50 μL of 100% ethanol to each sample. The samples were briefly vortexed before centrifugation at 3,000 g at 4°C for 30 min. After removing the supernatant by centrifugation at 185 g for 15 s, the DNA precipitates were washed with 70 μL of 70% ethanol per sample.</p><p id="P14">The sequencing results were analysed with the SnapGene® Viewer v5.2.4 and BLAST® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) to identify candidate iPSC clones that underwent successful genetic modifications at the targeted regions. These candidate iPSC clones were further sub-cloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vectors (Promega) to determine the genetic modifications at the allelic level using the same primers for the Exon 1 and 4 targeted regions. The vectors were then transformed into One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent <italic>E. coli</italic> (Thermo) by heat shock at 42°C for 45 s. At least six bacterial clones were picked and sequenced the way it was described above using T7 and SP6 promoter primers (embedded in pGEM®-T Easy Vectors).</p><p id="P15">Once the homozygosity/heterozygosity of the intended genetic modifications was determined, the sequence-confirmed iPSC clones were differentiated into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or neurons and their cell lysates were analysed by western blot to confirm tau depletion. A Human OmniExpress v1.2 BeadChip array (Illumina) was used post-editing to check for any gross karyotype abnormalities, and none were detected in all iPSC lines used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Lentivirus generation</title><p id="P16">The lentiviral particles used in this study expressing genes of interest were generated by expressing lentiviral proteins in HEK293T cells grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μM non-essential amino acids and 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (all from Thermo). HEK293T cells were passaged with TrypLE™ (Thermo) and seeded at 80,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (1,000,000 cells in a T75 flask) 24 h before plasmid transfection.</p><p id="P17">The following protocol describes the reagents used for a single T75 flask of HEK293T cells. A Lipofectamine™ 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo) was used to deliver plasmids into HEK293T cells. 40 μL Lipofectamine™ 3000 transfection reagent was first mixed with 50 μL of P3000 reagent (from the same kit) in 1 mL of Opti-MEM™ medium (Thermo) for at least 5 min. Second-generation lentiviral packaging plasmids psPAX2 (#12260; 10 μg) and pMD2.G (#12259; 5.65 μg) were mixed with plasmids expressing genes of interest (FUdeltaGW-rtTA (rtTA; #19780; 9.6 μg), pTet-O-Ngn2-puro (Ngn2; #52047; 9.6 μg) or pLV-TetO-hNGN2-eGFP-Puro (Ngn2-GFP; #79823; 9.6 μg)) to achieve equimolar ratios in 1 mL of Opti-MEM™ medium in another tube. All plasmids were purchased from Addgene. Finally, the plasmid tube was added to the Lipofectamine tube dropwise before adding the mixture to the cells now grown in 13 mL of the above-mentioned medium without Penicillin-Streptomycin. The transfection reagents were left overnight and replaced with fresh medium the following day with Penicillin-Streptomycin.</p><p id="P18">The lentivirus-containing cell supernatant was collected 48 h after the last medium change, and it was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min to remove any cells before filtering through a cellulose acetate membrane with 0.45 μm pore size (Millipore). The supernatant was snap-frozen in dry ice before storing it at -80°C. For the pLV-TetO-hNGN2-eGFP-Puro virus, the aliquots were thawed once and sub-aliquoted in small volume to keep the lentivirus titre consistent since a small amount of this lentivirus was needed per transduction.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Differentiation of iPSC lines into cortical neurons</title><p id="P19">All iPSC lines were seeded on Matrigel® (Corning)-coated plates and cultured in mTeSR™ medium (STEMCELL Technologies) which was replaced daily. Fully confluent iPSC culture was passaged at a 1:6 ratio with TrypLE™ (Thermo) for 5 min in the incubator and pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min.</p><p id="P20">Two variations of cortical neuron differentiation protocols were adapted and combined from Shi <italic>et al.</italic> (pharmacologically directed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (transcription factor directed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) into a single protocol and adapted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). All media were filtered through a polyethersulfone membrane with a 0.22 μm pore size (Millipore). All cortical neuron cultures were seeded in co-culture with a confluent layer of primary rat cortical astrocytes (Thermo) except for harvesting cell lysate or live assays with dyes which are not cell-type specific. For the neuronal monoculture without rat astrocytes, the end point of differentiation was set to be Day 50 or before to ensure that the culture remained relatively homogeneous without any contamination with non-neuronal cells that might emerge sporadically throughout the differentiation process.</p><p id="P21">The first 25 days of cortical neuron differentiation was adapted from Shi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). All iPSC lines were first seeded concurrently on Geltrex™ (Thermo)-coated plates at 105,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (1,000,000 cells in a well of a six-well plate) in mTeSR™ medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (Tocris). The Y-27632 compound was removed from the medium the next day and subsequently the medium was replaced daily. When the iPSC culture became confluent (Day 0), it was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before changing to neural induction medium (NIM) which is neural maintenance medium (NMM) supplemented with 10 μM SB-431542 (Tocris) and 1 μM Dorsomorphin. NMM contains two types of media at 1:1 ratio: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) Neurobasal™ medium (Thermo) supplemented with 1X B-27™ supplement (Thermo), 25 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo) and 1 X GlutaMAX (Thermo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) DMEM/F12 medium (Thermo) supplemented with 1X N-2 supplement (Thermo), 50 μM non-essential amino acid (Thermo), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Thermo), 2.5 μg/ml insulin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo). The NIM was subsequently replaced daily until Day 12.</p><p id="P22">The cells were passaged on Day 12 with 1 mg/ml dispase (10 mg/ml dispase dissolved in PBS and added directly to the cell culture media), for approximately 10 to 30 min in the incubator depending on the lifting efficiency. A sheet of cells would detach from the plate bottom and was then broken up by pipetting once before transferring to 10 mL of NIM. The cell aggregates were allowed to settle by gravity before they were washed by 10 mL of NIM twice. Finally, the cell aggregates were seeded onto 15 μg/ml fibronectin-coated plates at a 1:2 ratio in NIM.</p><p id="P23">On Day 13 and 15, the cells were provided with NMM supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2. On Day 17, the cell cultures were passaged as on Day 12 except that the cells were washed and plated in NMM. The cell aggregates were seeded onto 100 μg/ml poly-L-ornithine plus 10 μg/ml laminin (PO/L)-coated plates at a 1:3 ratio (the plates were first coated with PO overnight at 37°C, before they were washed once with PBS and then coated with laminin overnight). Finally, the NMM was replaced every two days until Day 25 where the NPCs were lifted by incubating with Accutase® and cryo-preserved at 2,000,000 cells/vial in NMM supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide.</p><p id="P24">The second part of the differentiation protocol beyond Day 25 was modified from Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and the protocol relies on a doxycycline-inducible overexpression system of <italic>Ngn2</italic> to result in an excitatory cortical neuronal identity. Each vial of NPCs was thawed, spun down, and plated into a single well in a twelve-well plate (Day 25). <italic>Ngn2</italic> and <italic>rtTA</italic> lentiviruses (25 μL each) were added into the cell suspension in NMM (supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 10 μM Y-27632) as the NPCs settled onto PO/L-coated plates. The medium was replaced 8 h later with fresh NMM. On Day 28, the NMM was replaced by neuronal medium consisting of Neurobasal™ medium (Thermo) supplemented with 1X B27™ (Thermo), 1X GlutaMAX™ (Thermo), 25 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo), 10 ng/ml neurotrophin-3, 10 ng/ml BDNF (Peprotech), 1 μg/ml doxycycline, 200 ng/ml laminin and 200 μM ascorbic acid. On Day 30, the neuronal medium was replaced and supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin.</p><p id="P25">On Day 32, the neurons were passaged with Accutase® and seeded in co-culture with a confluent monolayer of primary rat cortical astrocyte seeded onto 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine-coated plates (coated overnight and washed once with PBS before seeding) at its third passage (Thermo). The iPSC-derived neuron-rat astrocyte co-culture was subsequently half-fed with the neuronal medium only twice a week. On Day 40, the co-culture was treated with 100 nMAra-C which was gradually removed over subsequent half-feedings. The neuronal culture was then allowed to age until Day 80 or after for downstream experiments.</p><p id="P26">When co-culture was not suitable for a particular experiment, the neurons were seeded onto PO/L-coated plates. The primary rat cortical astrocyte culture was maintained in DMEM with high glucose supplemented with 15% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo) and 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo). After the neurons were seeded onto the astrocyte, the co-culture was maintained in the neuronal medium only.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Western blot</title><p id="P27">The NPCs were seeded on PO/L-coated plates on Day 25 and maintained until Day 30 for harvesting without virus transduction, while others were transduced with the <italic>Ngn2</italic> lentivirus and final-plated on Day 32 for harvesting on Day 50 as neurons. The cells were washed once with PBS before they were lysed on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at pH 7.4. The RIPA buffer was supplemented with cOmplete™ mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysate was then transferred into a tube on ice and left incubating for at least 15 min. Finally, the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C before the supernatant was frozen at -80°C.</p><p id="P28">To quantify protein concentration in the lysates, a Pierce™ Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) was used following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 12.5 μL of either bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards or cell lysates were added into a 96-well plate followed by 100 μL of the BCA reagent. The plate underwent incubation at 37°C for 30 min before it was read for absorbance at 562 nm wavelength in a PHERAstar® microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Protein concentration was determined by comparing to a BSA standard curve.</p><p id="P29">For western blots to examine total tau protein, cell lysates underwent dephosphorylation with (final concentration in the mixture) 10% MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% reaction buffer and 0.38 μL lamda-phosphatase (New England Biolab; sufficient for up to 10 μg of cell lysate) for 1 h at 30°C prior to adding the sample loading dye for denaturation. Cell lysates were then denatured by heating at 95°C for 10 min with sample loading dye containing (final concentration in the mixture) 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 375 mM Tris at pH 6.8.</p><p id="P30">Denatured samples were loaded into precast 4-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) submerged in running buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine and 0.1% SDS.

The IP-MS results indicated that tau peptides were indeed detectable in all <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>) but the MS signal intensity (an estimate for quantity) was very low and significantly less than that in the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons at 1%, 0.06% and 11% for the Exon 1 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> #1, Exon 1 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> #2 and Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). This IP-MS experiment was unable to identify the specific non-canonical tau peptide observed in the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT</italic>+/<italic>-</italic> and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines, thus it is unclear if those tau peptides are functional. We therefore concluded that these <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines retain residual tau expression, but the expression levels are extremely low for the Exon 1 panel with an estimated ≤1% tau expression, an almost total depletion, whereas the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons expressed a non-canonical tau peptide level at approximately 11% relative to the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Tau depletion protects neurons from AD brain-derived Aβ-driven hyperactivity</title><p id="P59">The Exon 1 and Exon 4 isogenic panels were then used for downstream experiments detailed in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We began by examining relatively more sensitive phenotypes such as neuronal activity and synapse loss, to axonal transport of mitochondria that involves a shorter time scale before examining relatively more severe cellular phenotypes such as neurite outgrowth impairment and neurodegeneration. To address if tau depletion affects neuronal activity, we differentiated the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines from both Exon 1 (<italic>MAPT-/-</italic> #1) and Exon 4 isogenic panels into cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) on MEA multi-well plates which have sixteen electrodes embedded at the bottom of the plates per well for extracellular field potential detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons from both Exon 1 and 4 panels exhibited marked impairments in neuronal activity across all parameters quantified i.e., showing reduced firing strength, frequency, synchronicity within the neuronal network and network firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P60">We then asked whether tau lowering can protect human iPSC-derived cortical neurons from exogenous toxic insults such as Aβ by treating neurons with AD brain homogenate, or with AD brain homogenate immunodepleted for Aβ (Aβ-ID) and assaying neuronal activity by MEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ line demonstrated AD brain homogenate-driven hyperactivity over time both in terms of single-electrode neuronal firing and network firing frequencies, whereas neuronal firing amplitude and synchrony remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This hyperactivity phenotype was not present after treatment by Aβ-ID, or after tau depletion, suggesting that the hyperactivity phenotype was specifically Aβ-driven and tau-dependent.</p><p id="P61">On the synapse level, tau depletion did not affect synaptic density in the iPSC-derived cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>). Bulk AD brain homogenate treatment led to a 20-30% synapse loss in the iPSC-derived cortical neurons regardless of their <italic>MAPT</italic> genotypes or the presence of Aβ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>; Exon 4). We then performed extraction and concentration of Aβ from the AD brain homogenate as detailed in <italic>Methods</italic> and showed that the treatment of AD brain-derived Aβ resulted in approximately 10% synapse loss in the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons but not in the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/<italic>-</italic> and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D</xref>; Exon 4). This indicates that AD brain-derived Aβ-driven synapse loss is tau-dependent, but that there are other soluble factors present in the AD brain homogenate that can result in synapse loss. Both bulk AD brain homogenate and brain-derived Aβ treatments were insufficient to cause synapse loss in the Exon 1 isogenic panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C and 5D</xref>; Exon 1).</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Tau depletion mitigates Aβ-driven deficit in retrograde axonal transport of mitochondria</title><p id="P62">Since tau is mainly localised in the axons as a microtubule-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), we next asked whether tau depletion interferes with axonal transport of mitochondria. The iPSC-derived cortical neurons were plated in one side of microfluidic chambers for live imaging of mitochondrial movement along axons with clear directionality as detailed in <italic>Methods</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We did not observe any changes in the ratio (to stationary mitochondria), speed and displacement of motile mitochondria in the <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P63">We subsequently investigated whether tau depletion mitigates neuronal response to Aβ in terms of impairments to axonal transport of mitochondria. Recombinant Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers were used as a source of a more acute and toxic Aβ insult to the neurons, as previously reported in mouse primary hippocampal neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). After one hour of exposure to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers, there were fewer motile mitochondria in the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons specifically in the retrograde direction while the Aβ-driven reduction in the number of mitochondria moving towards the soma was mitigated in the <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that the neuronal response to exogenous Aβ insult in axonal transport, at least for mitochondria as a cargo, is tau dependent. The treatment of exogenous Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers did not result in any changes in either speed or displacement of motile mitochondria along axons in the iPSC-derived cortical neurons regardless of their <italic>MAPT</italic> genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>). We also found that there were no differences in mitochondrial membrane potential within the Exon 1 and 4 isogenic panels at basal level, nor in response to exogenous Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers, indicating that the tau-dependent phenotype in axonal transport of mitochondria observed was unrelated to mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6C and 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Tau depletion does not consistently result in neurite outgrowth impairments</title><p id="P64">We went on to investigate whether tau lowering can result in changes in neuronal morphology. To address this question, we transduced a subset of iPSC-derived cortical neurons with vectors expressing GFP alongside <italic>NGN2</italic> and tracked their individual neurite outgrowth with live imaging over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Both <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> (#1 line) neurons from the Exon 1 isogenic panel and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> from the Exon 4 isogenic panel exhibited neurite outgrowth impairment with shorter neurite and axonal lengths, as well as lower ramification index (levels of branching per root from soma) as compared to the respective <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ lines without alterations in neurite branch length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>). However, the <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> (#2 line) neurons from the Exon 1 isogenic panel did not suffer from any neurite outgrowth impairment and surprisingly demonstrated a reduction in neurite branch length as compared to the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons suggesting that tau depletion alone is inadequate to consistently result in neurite outgrowth impairments.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Tau depletion protects neurons from Aβ-driven neurodegeneration</title><p id="P65">Finally, we asked whether tau lowering can mitigate Aβ-driven neurodegeneration in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. We again used recombinant Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers as a more acute and toxic source of Aβ to induce neurodegeneration in the iPSC-derived cortical neurons and measured the percentage of cleaved caspase 3-positive (CC3+) neurons as a readout for cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In both Exon 1 and 4 isogenic panels, there was a substantial increase in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomer-driven neurodegeneration in the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Tau depletion was effective in mitigating Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomer-driven neurodegeneration in both <italic>MAPT</italic>+/<italic>-</italic> and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons, a finding that was consistent in both isogenic panels, indicating that this phenotype is tau-dependent and, crucially, that partial tau reduction was also sufficient to mitigate Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomer-driven neurodegeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P66">In this study, we demonstrated that tau depletion in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons caused considerable reductions in neuronal activity without affecting synaptic density. We also observed neurite outgrowth impairments in two of the <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines studied. Other phenotypes, including axonal transport of mitochondria, mitochondrial function, and cortical neuron differentiation efficiency remained unaffected by tau depletion. These observations are consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conducted in <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mice where the absence of tau did not lead to overt behavioural or cognitive deficiencies and mouse <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> primary neurons exhibited reduced baseline activity and neurite outgrowth impairment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Challenging iPSC-derived cortical neurons with exogenous Aβ resulted in hyperactivity, retrograde axonal transport deficit of mitochondria and neurodegeneration but, crucially, we find these adverse effects were mitigated by tau depletion.</p><p id="P67">In the presence of exogenous Aβ human iPSC-derived cortical neurons experienced hyperactivity which is tau-dependent. This is in line with clinical observations where pre-symptomatic AD patients present with hippocampal hyperactivity, as well as preclinical findings in AD mouse models where neurons in the vicinity of Aβ plaques are hyperactive, a behavioural phenotype that has been found to require tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). It has also been reported that <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> neurons were less prone to hypersynchrony caused by over-excitation and that <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mice were protected from Aβ-driven seizure episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Overall, the diminished baseline neuronal activity seen in both mouse and human tau-depleted neurons may be considered a protective mechanism, rather than a functional deficit.</p><p id="P68">One of the strengths of our study is the generation and analysis of multiple <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines generated from different individuals and targeted using different strategies. Generating multiple lines allowed us to observe line-to-line variation in the response of two iPSC lines derived from different individuals to exogenous Aβ insults. Specifically, the Exon 1 isogenic panel appeared more resilient to the Aβ insults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C and 5D</xref>) highlighting the importance of isogenic controls to eliminate from downstream experiments any effects arising from genetic variations between different individuals. Even within respective isogenic panels we still observed differences between the lines for certain phenotypes, such as neurite outgrowth impairment shown in one of the two Exon 1 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines. This inconsistency in neurite outgrowth has also been observed in different <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mouse strains and it has been suggested that compensatory expression from other microtubule-associated proteins could potentially account for the difference, although it is unclear how this is regulated in different <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P69">A challenge in any study modelling AD <italic>in vitro</italic> is the choice of exogenous Aβ insult applicable across a range of phenotypic assays. We found AD brain homogenate to be a physiological source of pathologically relevant Aβ for electrophysiological and synaptic assays with a concentration of Aβ in the pM range. AD brain homogenate had been routinely used in other electrophysiology studies and we found that the hyperactivity readout in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons was particularly sensitive to and specifically caused by the presence of Aβ. However, we did not observe such specificity in the synapse loss experiment, suggesting that other soluble factors present in the AD brain homogenate could similarly lead to synapse loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>). Treating neurons with purified AD brain-derived Aβ demonstrated that the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons were protected from Aβ-driven synapse loss, although 200 pg/ml of AD brain-derived Aβ was insufficient to cause synapse loss in the Exon 1 isogenic panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D</xref>). However, the use of AD brain-derived Aβ is limited by the capture-elution efficiency of the current method in which 1 g of AD brain tissue was needed to extract 1 ng of AD brain-derived Aβ.</p><p id="P70">Recombinant Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers provide a higher concentration of exogenous Aβ resulting in more robust phenotypes. Retrograde axonal transport of mitochondria was impaired by 2 μM of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers in iPSC-derived cortical neurons, consistent with a previous study in mouse primary hippocampal neurons with a similar experimental setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, in that previous study axonal transport was impaired in both directions and it was later reported that naturally occurring Aβ peptides in an AD mouse model led to axonal transport deficits only in the anterograde direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The consensus between the present human cell model study and previous mouse studies is that Aβ drives a reduction in the number of motile mitochondria transported along axons, although specific effects of Aβ may be dependent on the experimental setup, source of Aβ and/or species of cellular model.</p><p id="P71">To cause a robust neurodegeneration cell death phenotype, we treated iPSC-derived cortical neurons with 10 μM of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers for five days. This supraphysiological insult consistently resulted in at least two-fold increase in the percentage of CC3-positive neurons, even in the Exon 1 isogenic panel which was more resilient to Aβ challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The <italic>MAPT</italic>+/<italic>-</italic> and <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> neurons from both isogenic panels consistently demonstrated protection from Aβ-driven neurodegeneration in line with a previous study in <italic>Mapt-/-</italic> primary hippocampal neurons in which 20 μM of Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> fibrils was used to treat neurons for four days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This critical phenotype highlights consistent protective effects of tau lowering in Aβ-driven toxicity in AD pathogenesis in human and mouse cells.</p><p id="P72">Another strength of our study was to investigate tau expression levels in <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines with very sensitive IP-MS methodology in addition to western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3</xref>). We found that the Exon 1 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines carrying single nucleotide insertions expressed extremely low levels (≤1%) of tau peptides as compared to the <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons, an almost total depletion. The Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> line (carrying a 25-bp deletion) produced a non-canonical tau-immunoreactive band of a molecular weight lower than that of the smallest 0N3R tau isoform which likely arose through skipping of exon 4, an event that was previously reported and would neither introduce an early stop codon nor alter the sequence of the remainder of the tau protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), at ~11% of overall expression levels as compared to the isogenic <italic>MAPT</italic>+/+ neurons. The IP-MS analysis returned a total of fifty-one peptides from a subset of <italic>MAPT</italic> exons and we were unable to determine the identity of the non-canonical tau peptide seen in the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> line. Future work may be able to characterise this variant through long-read sequencing of mRNA product(s). Nevertheless, marked tau depletion was achieved in the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines and all phenotypes reported in the Exon 1 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> lines were consistently reproduced in the Exon 4 <italic>MAPT-/-</italic> line, suggesting the functional effects observed were specifically caused by chronic tau depletion.</p></sec><sec id="S34" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P73">In this study, we established stable human iPSC isogenic panels with chronic tau depletion from two healthy individuals.
