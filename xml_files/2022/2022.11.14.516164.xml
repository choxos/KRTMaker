Whilst much of our understanding of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells has been discerned from murine studies, human IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells remain less-well characterised. We optimised an <italic>in vitro</italic> polarisation protocol to expand human IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells from PBMC or bulk CD8+ T-cell populations for phenotypic and functional assessment. We show that T-cell activation in the presence of IL-1β and IL-23 significantly increased the frequencies of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells, which was not further enhanced by the addition of IL-6, IL-2 or anti-IFNγ mAb. <italic>In vitro-</italic>generated IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells from healthy donors displayed a distinct type-17 profile compared with IL-17A- CD8+ T-cells, as defined by transcriptional signature (<italic>IL17A, IL17F, RORC, RORA, MAF, IL23R, CCR6, CXCR6</italic>); high surface expression of CCR6 and CD161; and polyfunctional production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IFNγ, TNFα and GM-CSF. A significant proportion of <italic>in vitro-</italic>induced IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells expressed TCRVα7.2 and bound MR1 tetramers, indicative of a MAIT CD8+ T-cell population. Using an IL-17A secretion assay, we demonstrate that the <italic>in vitro-</italic>generated IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells were biologically functional and induced pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 production by synovial fibroblasts from patients with psoriatic arthritis. Collectively, we report an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system to expand IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells and further characterise their phenotype, transcriptional regulation and functional relevance to human health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tc17 cells</kwd><kwd>IL-17A</kwd><kwd>IL-17F</kwd><kwd>psoriatic arthritis</kwd><kwd>MAIT cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) was originally identified as an effector cytokine produced by T-helper (Th) CD4+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and together with fellow family member IL-17F, has come to characterise a distinct lineage termed Th17 cells. Multiple studies have described the factors and conditions that drive the differentiation of murine and human Th17 cells as well as their involvement in both host-protective and pathological immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Additionally, robust evidence implicates IL-17A (either independently or synergistically with other pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>)) to have a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis for which IL-17A is now a therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4"><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have highlighted IL-17A production is not restricted to Th17 cells; instead, a collection of conventional, unconventional T-cells and innate-like cell types may serve as alternative sources of IL-17A and IL-17F either in health or disease-relevant tissues (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>)). In particular, IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells, often referred to as Tc17 cells, are known to share phenotypic and functional features of Th17 cells (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)). This includes expression of the lineage-committing transcription factors retinoic acid-receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-MAF), surface expression of the typical type-17 markers CD161, CCR6 and IL-23R, and concomitant expression of Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) and cytotoxic CD8+ Tc1 (interferon (IFN)γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α) related cytokines. The presence of these Tc17 cells has been described at different tissue sites in a variety of human infectious, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We have also previously identified an enrichment of Tc17 cells in the joints of PsA patients that correlated with disease activity measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Whilst phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles of Tc17 cells derived <italic>ex vivo</italic> from patients with inflammatory disease have been reported, functional studies remain limited due to the relative paucity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> expansion of Tc17 cells could overcome this limitation and allow phenotypic and functional studies of this cell population.</p><p id="P5">To date, several murine <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that Tc17 cell differentiation can be achieved by applying Th17 polarising protocols, largely inclusive of a combination of transforming growth factor (TGF)β, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-21, IL-23, anti-IL-4 and anti-IFNγ (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)). Analogous to Th17 cells, murine Tc17 cells were shown to be a heterogeneous population including non-pathogenic and pathogenic subtypes, the latter typically defined by enhanced cytotoxicity with dual IL-17 and IFNγ expression promoted by IL-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). However, few studies have described factors driving human Tc17 cells. The small collection of studies thus far offers a consensus in that IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23 without or with TGFβ and anti-IFNγ can direct Tc17 cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In addition, evidence for involvement of cellular drivers comes from reports that activated monocytes from tumour sites rather than non-tumour tissues more potently induced IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and that pleural mesothelial cells from patients with tuberculosis infection significantly enhanced IL-17 production by patient blood-derived CD8+ T-cells, in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an innate-like T-cell subset defined by high expression of CD161 and their semi-invariant αβ T-cell receptor (TCR) restricted to Vα7.2- Jα33/Jα12/Jα20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Expression of TCRVα7.2 restricts MAIT cells to the non-polymorphic MHC class Ib molecule MHC-related protein 1 (MR1), which presents microbial-derived metabolites of riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis including 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). These unconventional T-cells are abundant in human tissues such as the gut and liver as well as in peripheral blood where they are predominantly CD8+ (enriched for CD8αα). Owing to their innate-like capacity, MAIT cell activation is elicited through either a TCR-dependent, TCR-independent, or synergistic manner, with the local cytokine milieu purportedly enhancing their effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This innate-like functionality and particularly, a type-17 program is imparted by expression of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) in MAIT cells as well as in other unconventional T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Subsequently, MAIT cells can express several type-17 associated markers including IL-23R, CCR6, RORγt and are potent producers of IL-17A and IL-17F that, together with IFNγ, TNFα and granzymes, rapidly orchestrate protective anti-microbial responses (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>)). Moreover, and akin to classical Tc17 cells, MAIT cells (notably of a type-17 phenotype) have also been implicated in several inflammatory diseases including psoriasis and spondyloarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The accumulating evidence for the presence of Tc17 cells in human inflammatory diseases together with the relative paucity in knowledge regarding their induction and function provides a strong rationale for detailed characterisation of these cells. Here, we describe a protocol to polarise and increase the frequency of human IL-17A+ and IL-17F+ CD8+ cells from either human PBMC or purified CD8+ T-cells, and we report their phenotypic and transcriptional profile. Furthermore, we provide evidence that human <italic>in vitro-</italic>induced IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells are bioactive and elicit disease-relevant pro-inflammatory responses from PsA patient-derived synovial fibroblasts, suggestive of a functional role of these cells in PsA joint inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Samples and cell isolation</title><p id="P8">Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy adult volunteers at King’s College London following written informed consent (Research Ethics Committee (REC) references 06/Q0705/20 and 17/LO/1940).

When our polarising condition was supplemented with IL-6 or anti-IFNγ, we did not observe consistently increased frequencies of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells.

Taken together, these analyses validate the cytokine secretion assay approach for specifically purifying type-17 cells that secrete bioactive IL-17A.</p><p id="P36">The leading transcriptional parameter defining segregation of IL-17A+ from IL-17A- CD8+ T-cells was identified as PLZF, which is commonly associated with directing type-17 effector function in unconventional rather than conventional T-cells. With further immunoprofiling, our analysis indeed revealed that <italic>in vitro</italic> polarisation did not only induce IL-17A and IL-17F expression in conventional CD8+ T cells, but also in Vα7.2+/MR1-tetramer<sup>pos</sup> MAIT cells. This finding is in line with reports evidencing that IL-17A and IL-17F production by MAIT cells requires cooperative TCR signalling with specific cytokine signals, such as IL-1β and IL-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), or IL-12 with IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Interestingly, the largest fraction of IL-17A/F expressing cells was contained within the MAIT population. One explanation could be that there was preferential expansion of IL-17A/F-producing MAIT cells upon <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, however our preliminary data did not reveal substantive differences in proliferative capacity between IL-17A+ CD8+ MAIT and conventional T-cells.</p><p id="P37">It was interesting to note that our PBMC polarising conditions led to a relative greater fold increase in IL-17F than IL-17A (7-fold versus 3-fold). Additionally, both conventional and MAIT IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells comprised IL-17A or IL-17F single and double positive cells. We have previously demonstrated that CD28 costimulation differentially regulates IL-17F versus IL-17A expression in CD4+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Furthermore, a previous study showed a 10-fold higher production of IL-17F compared with IL-17A upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of CD8+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and IL-17F was found to be the dominant isoform when MAIT cells were stimulated in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest differential regulation of IL-17A and IL-17F production in human T-cells.</p><p id="P38">Even though <italic>in vitro</italic> polarisation induced two distinct populations of IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells, our data indicate that Vα7.2- conventional and Vα7.2+ MAIT IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cell types share a common polyfunctional profile and actively secrete a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-17A, IL-22, GM-CSF, IFNγ and TNFα. Of note, IL-17A+ Vα7.2+ CD8+ T-cells appeared to induce a more potent pro-inflammatory response in PsA-derived synovial fibroblasts, on average inducing greater levels of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with IL-17A+ Vα7.2- conventional CD8+ T-cells. This may be attributable to elevated levels of TNFα, and in some donors more IL-17FF/AF, in IL-17A+ Vα7.2+ CD8+ T-cells compared with the IL-17A+ Vα7.2- CD8+ T-cell counterparts. These subtle differences in our findings strengthen the importance to distinguish between classical and unconventional cell types, which to date few studies have performed when broadly identifying IL-17-producing CD8+ T-cells. This may indeed explain research discrepancies and for future assessments, it is essential protective or pathological contributions of individual subsets are clearly ascertained.</p><p id="P39">By addition of secukinumab and adalimumab in IL-17A+CD8+ T-cell–fibroblast co-cultures, we reaffirmed cooperation of IL-17A with TNFα in driving pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the context of PsA. Whilst IL-17F has reduced potency relative to IL-17A, we previously showed IL-17F can similarly synergise with TNFα to elicit significant inflammatory responses in synovial fibroblasts from PsA and RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Dual blockade of IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab also more effectively reduced IL-17-driven secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 by synovial fibroblasts compared with blockade of IL-17A alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). An IL-17F CSA was not commercially available, however it would be of interest to isolate IL-17A and IL-17F single and double positive T-cell subsets to investigate further their individual versus combined functional roles.</p><p id="P40">We verified functionality of our <italic>in vitro-</italic>generated IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells and for the first-time report clinically relevant modulation of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cell-PsA synovial fibroblast interactions, which suggests a pro-inflammatory contribution of Tc17 cells to PsA joint inflammation. A pathogenic function of human Tc17 cells has previously been demonstrated in adoptive transfer models. Hu et al. showed that adoptive transfer of human <italic>in vitro-</italic>generated CAR-directed type-17 T-cells (a mixture of Th17 and Tc17) primed with a RORγt agonist mediated potent anti-tumour responses in a murine melanoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Mechanistically, they showed that co-transfer of Th17 cells with Tc17 cells mediated robust and long-lived anti-tumour immunity, consistent with previous publications which showed that Th17 cells can augment the activation of CD8+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Hinrichs et al. also reported that type 17-polarised CD8+ T-cells mediated enhanced anti-tumour immunity and demonstrated greater persistence than non-polarised CD8+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). An in-depth study by Gartlan et al., using fate mapping reporter mice also showed that mouse Tc17 cells differentiate during GVHD culminating in a highly plastic, hyperinflammatory, poorly cytolytic effector population, which they termed “inflammatory iTc17” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Targeted depletion of these inflammatory iTc17 cells resulted in protection from lethal GVHD.</p><p id="P41">These <italic>in vivo</italic> data together with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data strongly suggests that Tc17 cells are biologically relevant contributors to inflammation in diseases where an enrichment of these cells is found. In addition, our <italic>in vitro</italic> induction approach has important potential to improve mechanistic understanding of how Tc17 cells contribute to pathogenic, as well as homeostatic, immune responses, which could offer novel translational insights into therapeutic targeting of these cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures1-6.</label><media xlink:href="EMS157209-supplement-Supplementary_Figures1_6_.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables1-3.</label><media xlink:href="EMS157209-supplement-Supplementary_Tables1_3_.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to express their thanks to the healthy volunteers and PsA patient participants, without whom the work would not have been possible.

Cumulative data show IL-6 and IL-8 production from fibroblasts cultured with <bold>(A)</bold> supernatants from sorted IL-17A+ or IL-17A- CD8+ T-cells, <bold>(B)</bold> supernatants from IL-17A+ Vα7.2- or IL-17A+ Vα7.2+ CD8+ T-cells or <bold>(C)</bold> total IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells (2.5x10<sup>4</sup>) in the absence or presence of isotype control, anti-IL-17A or anti-TNFα neutralising antibodies. Data are plotted as median + IQR with dashed red lines indicating lower and upper ELISA detection limits. Statistical analysis was performed using a matched-paired Friedman test <bold>(A, C</bold> n=7<bold>)</bold> or unmatched Kruskal Wallis test <bold>(B</bold> n=5-7<bold>)</bold> with comparison to medium <bold>(A-C)</bold> and isotype <bold>(C)</bold> by Dunn’s Multiple Comparisons test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157209-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
