The replisome is powered by the replicative helicase CMG (Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS), which centrally orchestrates the other components and leads the way at the front of replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Understanding the motion of CMG on DNA is therefore crucial to our understanding of how cells successfully replicate DNA. <italic>In vivo</italic>, loading and activation of CMG on DNA occur in temporally separated fashion. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in particular, CMG loading occurs at specific sequences known as origins of replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. First, in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, a set of proteins known as ‘loading factors’ scans the DNA until such origins of replication are located, at which inactive single and double Mcm2-7 hexamers are then loaded onto dsDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In the subsequent S-phase, double Mcm2-7 hexamers are selectively phosphorylated by the cell cycle-regulated Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Then, a set of proteins known as ‘firing factors’ facilitates the assembly of full CMG by recruiting the helicase-activating factors Cdc45 and GINS to the phosphorylated Mcm2-7 double hexamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Upon full assembly, CMG must transition from encircling dsDNA to encircling ssDNA, so that it can unwind dsDNA by steric exclusion of the non-translocation strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This transition is known as CMG activation and consists of two steps. In the first step, ATP binding allows each CMG in a double hexamer to melt 0.6-0.7 turns of dsDNA within its central channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In the second step, each CMG extrudes one strand of the double helix from its central channel; this final step requires ATP hydrolysis and the action of the firing factor Mcm10<sup>3</sup>. After having extruded one strand of DNA, each activated sister CMG translocates on ssDNA in a 3’-to-5’ direction by hydrolyzing ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, allowing the two helicases to bypass and move away from each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and committing the cell to initiate DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This entire process requires a minimal set of 36 polypeptides and has been fully reconstituted from purified <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins in ensemble biochemical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To date, the motion of fully reconstituted and activated CMG has been studied in bulk biochemical assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> with a temporal resolution of minutes. These ensemble biochemical studies have provided us with important insights into the average behavior of CMG; nonetheless, lower probability behaviors are averaged out in the ensemble readouts. On the other hand, single-molecule studies have the power to isolate and study low probability events with higher temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; nevertheless, single-molecule studies of CMG motion so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> have focused on preformed CMG assembled through a poorly understood mechanism that requires co-overexpression of individual subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. What is more, given that such pre-formed CMG requires an artificial region of ssDNA to bind DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, these studies could not access the intricacies of CMG activation, such as the role of CMG motion during this process. We therefore set out to assemble and activate CMG from purified <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins and study its motion during this process at the single-molecule level.</p><sec id="S2"><title>A hybrid ensemble and single-molecule assay to visualize fully reconstituted CMG</title><p id="P4">One of the biggest challenges of studying the motion of fully reconstituted CMG at the single-molecule level is to prevent all the proteins involved from aggregating onto the long (tens of kbp) DNA molecules needed to observe motion of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To overcome this challenge, we developed a hybrid ensemble and single-molecule assay to 1) assemble and activate fully reconstituted fluorescent CMG onto ~24 kbp DNA molecules containing a natural yeast ARS1 replication origin in an aggregation-free manner; and 2) use a combination of dual optical trapping and confocal scanning microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> to image and quantify the motion of fluorescent CMG along DNA molecules held in an optical trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-<italic>i</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig.1a</xref>, Methods). To this end, we functionalized both ends of a linear 23.6 kb DNA containing a natural ARS1 origin with digoxigenin and desthiobiotin moieties at both ends. We then bound the functionalized DNA to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used it to assemble and activate CMG (Methods). In short, we loaded Mcm2-7 hexamers onto the bead-bound DNA, phosphorylated double Mcm2-7 hexamers with DDK and washed the beads with 300 mM KCl. We then assembled <italic>and</italic> activated CMG for 15 min in the presence of fluorescently labeled Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), which supports unwinding near WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Following CMG assembly and activation, we washed the beads again with 300 mM KCl to select for fully mature CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and ‘paused’ the reaction by removing ATP. DNA:CMG complexes were then eluted from the magnetic beads by competing the desthiobiotin-streptavidin interaction with an excess of free biotin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Following elution, DNA:CMG complexes were tethered between two optically-trapped anti-digoxigenin-coated polystyrene beads, and transferred into a buffer solution containing Mcm10, RPA and either ATP, no nucleotide, or the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS. We then scanned the DNA with a confocal scanning laser and observed fluorescent CMG helicases as diffraction-limited spots on the otherwise unlabeled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-<italic>ii</italic></xref>). Approximately a third of the trapped DNA molecules contained diffraction-limited fluorescent CMG spots, typically a single one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We deduced the number of CMG per diffraction-limited spot by counting the photobleaching steps within each spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, Methods). As this showed that most spots contained 1 CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), it followed that most DNA molecules had a total of 1 CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>), where <italic>a priori</italic> one might have expected a total closer to 2 or multiples thereof. We cannot attribute our experimentally measured lower number to the labeling efficiency of Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup>, which we measured to be 85 ± 4 %; rather, we attribute it to (a potential combination of) other factors including loss of Cdc45 during the high salt washes and downstream handling, CMG dissociation at nicks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> on the DNA during the ensemble activation, or CMG diffusing off the ends of the DNA during elution. Furthermore, it was recently shown that each Mcm2-7 in a double hexamer independently matures into CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, we cannot discard the possibility that in our system only one of the two Mcm2-7 hexamers is fully matured into CMG.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Mature CMG is preferentially assembled near origins of replication</title><p id="P5">We first looked at the initial positions of CMG on the DNA. Of note, because we cannot differentiate between the two possible orientations of the DNA in our experiments, we display the initial positions of CMG in plots showing the distance from the center of the DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We observe a wide distribution of initial positions with a peak near or at the ARS1 origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, spots containing two CMG complexes are less widely distributed around the origin than spots containing one CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-f</xref>). Taken together, these results are consistent with a preferential assembly of sister CMG helicases near the ARS1 origin, followed by the motion of individual activated helicases away from the origin during the 15-min ensemble activation reaction.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Colocalization of fluorescent Cdc45 and fluorescent Mcm2-7 hexamers is DDK-dependent</title><p id="P6">Salt-resistant Cdc45 is considered a hallmark of mature CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, if the Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> spots that we observe are part of <italic>bona fide</italic> CMG, their presence on the DNA should be dependent on DDK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To confirm this, we quantified the co-localization of red fluorescently labeled Mcm2-7<sup>JF646-Mcm3</sup> with green fluorescently labeled Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> (shown to jointly support DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>)) in the presence and absence of DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g-j</xref>). While nearly 20% of Mcm2-7<sup>JF646-Mcm3</sup> spots colocalized with Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> in the presence of DDK, we observed ~4-fold decrease in this colocalization in the absence of DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h-j</xref>). The 20% colocalization that we observe in the presence of DDK is in agreement with previous observations that the <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly of CMG is less efficient than the loading of Mcm2-7 double hexamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results show that the Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> fluorescent spots in our images correspond to <italic>bona fide</italic> CMG. We attribute the residual colocalization of Mcm2-7<sup>JF646-Mcm3</sup> and Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> in the absence of DDK to non-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2h</xref>) and/or to traces of phosphorylated Mcm2-7 in the protein preparation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Fully reconstituted CMG helicases exhibit two quantitatively distinct motion types</title><p id="P7">We next sought to quantify the motion of CMG in the presence of ATP. For this, we implemented a change-point algorithm (CPA) to fit linear segments through regions of the position-vs.-time plots of individual spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, Methods); the slopes of these segments then give us a noise-reduced value of the instantaneous velocities of individual fluorescent spots. To calibrate our analysis, we imaged dCas9<sup>LD555</sup> with the same imaging conditions that we used for CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>); because dCas9<sup>LD555</sup> is static on the DNA, it provides us with a measure of the velocity error in our system. After drift correction, the distribution of instantaneous velocities of fluorescent dCas9<sup>LD555</sup> spots after the CPA fit is centered at 0 bp/s and has a width σ<sub>dCas9</sub> that reflects our experimental uncertainty in velocity measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> inset). For all CMG motion analysis, we defined a conservative velocity cutoff of 5 × σ<sub>dCas9</sub> (= 2.0 bp/s) to categorize fluorescent spots as static or mobile; we considered mobile any fluorescent spot with at least one CPA segment with a slope above this threshold, and all other spots static.</p><p id="P8">Following the approach described above, we determined that ~70% of CMG spots are mobile when imaged in a buffer solution containing RPA, Mcm10 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Unexpectedly, when we imaged CMG in a buffer solution containing RPA, Mcm10 and no ATP, we observed that ~40% of CMG spots were also mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Nonetheless, we noticed qualitative differences in motion of CMG in the presence and absence of ATP: while CMG seemed to move unidirectionally in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>), it appeared to move in a more random (e.g. diffusive) manner in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). To quantitatively characterize these two apparently distinct motion types, we employed two independent approaches. First, we looked at the CPA segments of all the traces in each condition, and calculated the probability that consecutive segments have the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>); in the absence of noise, this probability should equal 1 for unidirectional motion, and 0.5 for random motion. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, our measured probabilities closely match these expected values, providing quantitative underpinning of our initial observations. As an independent approach, we conducted anomalous diffusion analysis of the mobile traces in each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b, 5e and 5h</xref>). For each individual trace, we calculated the mean-squared displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time τ, and then fitted the result to the equation MSD(<italic>τ</italic>) ∝ <italic>τ<sup>α</sup></italic> to extract the anomalous diffusion coefficient <italic>α</italic> (Methods). The value of <italic>α</italic> then allowed us to classify each trace into different motion types, as <italic>α</italic> ≫ 1 for unidirectionally moving molecules, <italic>α</italic> ≈ 1 for a freely diffusive molecules, and 0 &lt; <italic>α</italic> ≪ 1 for molecules undergoing constrained diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). This anomalous diffusion analysis confirms that unidirectional motion is most likely when ATP is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), whereas diffusive behavior is most likely when ATP is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We note that we observed a small population of seemingly diffusive CMG spots in the presence of ATP, and a small population of seemingly unidirectionally moving CMG spots in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-h</xref>). We hypothesized that these subpopulations might have arisen from misclassification of short traces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To test this hypothesis, we simulated two populations of single-molecule traces of varying lengths within the range of our experimental data: one population solely consisting of unidirectionally moving traces, and the other population solely consisting of freely diffusive traces (Methods). We then carried out the same anomalous diffusion analysis that we did on the experimental CMG data on both simulated data sets. We observed that the distribution of motion types for the simulated unidirectional traces looked very similar to that of the experimental mobile CMG traces in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), whereas the distribution of motion types for the simulated diffusive traces looked very similar to that of the experimental mobile CMG traces in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Thus, the results of our simulations suggest that, overall, the mobile traces in the presence of ATP represent unidirectional motion, whereas the mobile traces in the absence of ATP represent diffusive motion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Analysis of CMG motor motion</title><p id="P10">Following this identification of two distinct types of CMG mobility, we investigated both in further depth. We first investigated the unidirectional motor motion of CMG, the motion type that powers the replisome. We thus specifically analyzed the velocities of unidirectionally moving CMG spots in the presence of ATP, which yielded a distribution of instantaneous velocities with a peak at ~5 bp/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), consistent with previous single-molecule studies on pre-formed CMG in the presence of RPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This distribution has a long tail, reaching up to instantaneous velocities of ~45 bp/s. These higher velocities are low in probability, suggesting that CMG can only achieve these high velocities in short time bursts. Consistent with this, when we calculated the time-averaged velocity of each CMG spot and examined the resulting distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> inset), we did not observe such high velocities. The distribution of time-averaged velocities has a peak at ~5 bp/s, which is consistent with ensemble biochemical studies of CMG motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, we did not observe any noticeable backtracking of CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies suggesting that RPA prevents CMG backtracking by keeping the lagging strand template out of the central channel of CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">When analyzing the unidirectional traces in the presence of ATP, we also observed a few instances of two unidirectionally translocating CMGs initially located within the same diffraction-limited spot, but that then split from one another and give rise to two diffraction-limited spots of half the intensity of the original spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>). These observations are consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical studies of helicase activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> showing that sister CMGs move in opposite directions upon their activation. The low probability of these splitting events is to be expected because i) we allow CMG to become activated and translocate on the DNA for 15 min before imaging, and ii) because most DNA molecules contain 1 CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Nucleotide binding halts diffusive CMG</title><p id="P12">Our data shows that CMG diffuses on DNA in the absence but not in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c and 2g-h</xref>), suggesting that ATP is involved in stopping this diffusive motion of CMG. To investigate whether it was the binding or the hydrolysis of ATP that stopped the diffusive motion of CMG, we investigated CMG motion in a buffer solution supplemented with RPA, Mcm10 and the slowly hydrolysable ATP analog ATPγS. When we imaged CMG under these conditions, the vast majority CMG spots were found to be static (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5i</xref>). Taken together with our data in the presence and absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-d</xref>), our results show that it is the nucleotide binding and not the hydrolysis that halts the diffusive motion of CMG. Furthermore, our results confirm that ATP hydrolysis is required for the unidirectional translocation of CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Previous biochemical studies showed that ATP binding allows newly formed CMG to melt 0.6-0.7 turns of the DNA within its central channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, which was recently confirmed by cryo electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Comparing these previous observations with our single-molecule results led us to hypothesize that 1) the diffusive motion that we observed in the absence of ATP corresponded to CMG surrounding dsDNA, and that 2) the halting of such diffusive motion in the presence of ATPγS is due to CMG melting the DNA within its central channel.</p><p id="P14">To test whether CMG can diffuse onto dsDNA in the absence of ATP, we developed an ensemble CMG sliding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>, Methods). Briefly, we synthesized two 1.4 kb linear DNA constructs biotinylated at one end and containing an ARS1 origin. The non-biotinylated end of the constructs was then either left as a free end or covalently crosslinked to a M.HpaII methyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Because the crosslinked methyltransferase is too large to fit inside the central channel of CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, it should stop CMG from diffusing off the end of the DNA, which would otherwise be free to diffuse off the free end of the DNA. We then bound both DNA constructs to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and assembled CMG in the presence of fluorescent Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> onto them; importantly, we omit the firing factor Mcm10 from the activation reaction to prevent strand extrusion from the central channel of CMG and ensure that CMG is surrounding dsDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. After CMG assembly, we incubated the bead-bound DNA in a buffer solution with or without ATPγS, and monitored the amount of fluorescent Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> present on the DNA over time. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>, we detected the fastest decay of Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> signal in the DNA construct with a free end in the absence of ATPγS, whereas there was only a small decay in the same DNA construct when ATPγS was present. We also observed some decay, albeit smaller in magnitude, in the DNA construct with a capped end in the absence of ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>); this smaller decay may result from spontaneous opening of the Mcm2-7 ring of CMG in the absence of nucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> on such timescales. Thus, the results of our ensemble assay support our hypothesis that CMG diffuses on dsDNA in the absence of ATP, and that nucleotide binding halts this diffusive motion.</p><p id="P15">To test whether the nucleotide-binding-mediated halting of CMG diffusion was due to DNA melting within the central channel of CMG, we employed a recently reported Mcm2 mutant in which six residues directly involved in DNA melting are substituted with alanine (hereafter referred to as Mcm2<sup>6A</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Notably, Mcm2<sup>6A</sup> supports CMG assembly but does not support either DNA melting or strand extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, allowing us to separate the effect of DNA melting from DNA binding. Thus, if DNA melting by CMG is indeed what halts its diffusive motion, then CMG assembled with Mcm2<sup>6A</sup> should be fully diffusive in the presence of ATP. Nevertheless, the vast majority of CMG spots assembled with Mcm2<sup>6A</sup> are static in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Furthermore, when we performed our ensemble CMG sliding assay with Mcm2<sup>6A</sup>, we observed the same trends as with WT Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9g-h</xref>), providing further evidence that CMG diffuses on dsDNA and that DNA melting is not necessary for the halting of CMG diffusion after ATP-binding. Altogether, our single-molecule and ensemble biochemical data show that the halting of CMG diffusion in the presence of nucleotide is <italic>not</italic> due to DNA melting by CMG, but due to binding of CMG to the DNA <italic>via</italic> other Mcm2-7:DNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">We report the first single-molecule quantification of the motion of fully reconstituted CMG helicases. To the best of our knowledge, these studies also constitute the first fully <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted single-molecule motion quantification of replicative helicases assembled at an origin of replication. To quantify the motion of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled CMG, we developed a novel hybrid ensemble and single-molecule assay based on the double functionalization of DNA ends, which we validated by verifying that the number of fluorescent CMG helicases per diffraction-limited spot, the initial CMG positions on the DNA, and the DDK-dependent colocalization of fluorescently labeled Cdc45 and Mcm2-7 agree with the consensus established by previous biochemical observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In our motion analysis, we observe a static and a mobile population of CMG both in the presence and in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Nonetheless, we quantitatively show that the mobile population in the presence of ATP preferentially moves unidirectionally, as expected for a molecular motor, whereas the mobile population in the absence of ATP preferentially moves in a diffusive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). To explain these motion outcomes, we propose the model summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, which is based on the assumption that our ensemble activation reaction contains a mixture of two populations of CMG: one population encircling dsDNA, and another population encircling ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-<italic>i</italic></xref>). In the first part of our model, we propose that the population of CMG surrounding ssDNA moves unidirectionally in the presence of ATP (as the motor can then hydrolyze ATP to unwind dsDNA), but remains static in the absence of ATP (as the motor is unable to unwind DNA without ATP hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, right half). This part of the model is supported by the fact that we observe very similar instantaneous and average velocities of unidirectionally translocating CMG spots to those of previous single-molecule and ensemble biochemical studies of DNA unwinding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We consider an alternative scenario in which at least part of the unidirectional translocation that we observe in the presence of ATP corresponds to CMG translocating on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>) – as was postulated to occur for CMG helicases that bypassed each other after the collision of two replication forks or after encountering a flush ss/dsDNA junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>– to be less likely. Consider, for example, the CMG splitting events that we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Because CMG translocation on dsDNA has the same 3’-to-5’ polarity as on ssDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, one could postulate that the splitting events represent two helicases that surround dsDNA following assembly at a single Mcm2-7 double hexamer, but such helicases would move <italic>towards</italic> each other (remaining within a single diffraction-limited spot), and not <italic>away</italic> from each other as our data shows. One could also postulate that the splitting events represent two helicases encircling dsDNA following assembly at distinct Mcm2-7 double hexamers within a single diffraction-limited spot. However, our analysis of Mcm2-7 spots shows such occurrences to be unlikely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Further studies will be required to assess whether and how the unidirectional motion of CMG differs according to whether it occurs on ssDNA or dsDNA.</p><p id="P18">In the second part of our model, we propose that the population of CMG surrounding dsDNA loses its bound ATP when we remove ATP from the buffer following our ensemble activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>); ATP dissociation then causes CMG to disengage from the DNA and thereby become diffusive. This diffusive population remains so in the absence of nucleotide (giving rise to the diffusive population we observe in the absence of nucleotide); nevertheless, upon ATP re-addition and re-binding, CMG is allowed to re-engage with the DNA inside its central channel and thus become static (giving rise to the static population in the presence of ATP). In support of this hypothesis, we showed that CMG can diffuse on dsDNA and that nucleotide binding halts this diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Furthermore, we show that this halting occurs independent of the previously observed DNA melting by CMG upon nucleotide binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>), suggesting that DNA engagement and DNA melting by CMG need not occur concomitantly. We propose that the presence of ATP in the nucleus prevents newly assembled CMG from diffusing along the DNA, poising the helicase to catalyse the initial melting required to initiate replication. Further studies investigating which of the additional Mcm2-7:DNA contacts within CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> are responsible for halting CMG diffusion upon nucleotide binding will shed further light into our observations.</p><p id="P19">Our measured diffusion coefficient of freely diffusive CMG under the ionic strength conditions of this study (250 mM K-glutamate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>) is similar to our previously measured diffusion coefficient of single Mcm2-7 hexamers in higher ionic strength conditions (500 mM NaCl)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that CMG diffuses more freely on the DNA than single Mcm2-7 hexamers, which in turn suggests that CMG has fewer contacts with the DNA than Mcm2-7 hexamers as recently confirmed by structural studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We also note that single-molecule studies with pre-formed <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CMG showed no evidence of CMG diffusion in the presence of ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, in agreement with our observations. However, single-molecule studies with pre-formed <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CMG reported extensive diffusive behavior in the presence of ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Further studies will be required to investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, and to probe potential differences between fully reconstituted and pre-formed CMG, such as whether the phosphorylation state of Mcm2-7 is different, and whether it could influence the interactions that Mcm2-7, the substrate of DDK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, have with the DNA.</p><p id="P20">ATP-dependent switching of motion modes, as we observe here for CMG, has been previously observed to act differently for other protein complexes, such as Type III restriction enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and the yeast chromatin remodeler SWR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In the case of Type III restriction enzymes, ATP hydrolysis triggers diffusion on the DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, whereas in the case of SWR1, ATP binding triggers its diffusion along the DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, these behaviors are different than in the case of CMG, whose diffusion is halted and not promoted by nucleotide binding.</p><p id="P21">Given the complexity and the number of components required to fully reconstitute CMG assembly and activation, <italic>in vitro</italic> single-molecule studies quantifying CMG motion have so far relied on preformed CMG helicases assembled through an unknown mechanism upon overexpression of individual constituents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Although these studies have provided us with very important insights into how CMG works, it is unknown whether the assembly mechanism of pre-formed CMG is cell-cycle regulated. It is therefore also unknown whether pre-formed CMG has a similar phosphorylation state to the one it has <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, pre-formed CMG requires an artificial region of ssDNA to bind DNA and thus does not allow us to access the intricacies of CMG assembly and activation. In this study, we report the first single-molecule quantification of the motion of fully reconstituted CMG helicases. We believe that the full reconstitution of CMG makes it more likely that the phosphorylation state of its constituents more closely mimics what happens <italic>in vivo</italic>; this in turn makes it more likely that fully reconstituted CMG can support all relevant interactions with proteins intrinsic and accessory to the replisome. Furthermore, the reliable assay we developed will allow us and others to address important questions regarding CMG motion, such as the mechanistic role of elongation factors, with unprecedented resolution. Finally, we anticipate that the novel assay we developed, based on the double functionalization of DNA ends with two orthogonal attachment types, will facilitate the study at the single-molecule level of similarly complex biochemical reactions involved in other nucleic acid:protein interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S9"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 1</label><caption><title>Hybrid ensemble and single-molecule assay and reagent validation.</title><p id="P22"><bold>a</bold>, SDS-PAGE showing the minimal set of purified proteins required for the reconstitution of CMG assembly and activation; the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue Stain and fluorescently scanned with either a red or a green laser, to show the fluorescently labeled proteins in either color. <bold>b</bold>, Ensemble unwinding assay showing that Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> supports DNA unwinding to near WT levels. <bold>c</bold>, Distribution of total numbers of fluorescent CMG complexes per DNA, obtained by combining the total number of CMG diffraction-limited spots per DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) with the number of CMG complexes within each spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS159046-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 2</label><caption><title>Reagent validation, distribution of number of Mcm2-7 spots and distribution of Mcm2-7 complexes within each spot.</title><p id="P23"><bold>a</bold>, Ensemble unwinding assay showing that Mcm2-7<sup>JF646</sup> supports DNA unwinding alone and in conjunction with Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup>. <bold>b</bold>, Distribution of the number of Mcm2-7 diffraction-limited spots per DNA in the presence of DDK. <bold>c</bold>, Distribution of the number of Mcm2-7 complexes within each diffraction-limited spot in the presence of DDK. <bold>d</bold>, Distribution of the total number of Mcm2-7 complexes per DNA molecule in the presence of DDK, obtained by combining data from <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>. <bold>e</bold>, Distribution of the number of Mcm2-7 diffraction-limited spots per DNA in the absence of DDK. <bold>f</bold>, Distribution of the number of Mcm2-7 complexes within each diffraction-limited spot in the absence of DDK. <bold>g</bold>, Distribution of the total number of Mcm2-7 complexes per DNA molecule in the absence of DDK, obtained by combining data from <bold>e</bold> and <bold>f</bold>. <bold>h</bold>, Fraction of Cdc45<sup>LD555</sup> diffraction-limited spots that are colocalized with Mcm2-7<sup>JF646</sup> diffraction-limited spots in the presence and absence of DDK; error bars show the standard error of proportion.
