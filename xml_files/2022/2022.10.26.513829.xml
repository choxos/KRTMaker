This assumes that priors are integrated optimally and equally in decisions and confidence, which has not been tested. In two experiments, we quantitatively assessed how priors inform both decisions and confidence. With a gamified dual-decision task we controlled the strength of priors and likelihoods to create pairs of conditions that were matched in posterior information, but differed on whether the prior or likelihood was more informative. We found that priors were underweighted in discrimination decisions, but used to a greater extent in confidence about those decisions, and this was not due to differences in processing time. With a Bayesian model we quantified the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and confirmed that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Human perception has often been shown to be based on a Bayesian inference process, in which the brain infers information about the environment by integrating incoming information with previous beliefs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Computationally, this involves the integration of a prior distribution (“prior”) with a likelihood distribution (“likelihood”) to give a posterior distribution (“posterior”), which then forms the basis of a belief or percept. Many studies have shown evidence supporting the idea that perception and decision-making can be explained as Bayesian inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Further, confidence, i.e. the sense of certainty that typically accompanies perceptual decisions, can also be explained by Bayesian inference models.</p><p id="P3">In formal terms, Bayesian models propose that confidence corresponds to the perceived posterior probability of being correct about our inferences, based on the relative strengths of the posterior probabilities of each hypothesis being considered. This Bayesian confidence model has been tested and supported empirically, in both animals and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. For example, evidence supporting the Bayesian confidence model has been found at the neural level in rats, with firing rates producing a signature “folded-X” pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In humans, this same Bayesian confidence model can quantitatively capture confidence reports, as well as predicting critical qualitative signatures of confidence, including the same characteristic folded-X pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The Bayesian approach has been highly influential (although non-Bayesian alternatives have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>). Importantly, this framework considers that the posterior percept is based on the precision-weighted integration of priors and likelihoods, and also that this same posterior gives rise to decisions and confidence. This simple formulation relies on two assumptions: first, that both decisions and confidence integrate priors and likelihoods optimally; and further, that confidence integrates priors and likelihoods in the same way as decisions. But these assumptions must be empirically tested, as the alternative is also possible: either confidence, decisions, or both, might integrate priors in systematically biased ways, and might do so asymmetrically.</p><p id="P4">Meanwhile, there is evidence to suggest that these kinds of suboptimalities often occur in human perception and confidence. Various systematic biases have been found in the information that enters confidence, such as a bias towards decision-congruent evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, or an overweighting of perceived sensory noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, several studies have found that confidence incorporates different or additional information compared to decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This supports the possibility that there are asymmetries in the way that certain sources of information influence these different processing levels. With regard to prior information, empirical work examining Bayesian confidence models has typically used uninformative, ‘flat’ priors, so it has not been possible to detect these potential biases or asymmetries. Two recent studies have begun examining confidence under informative priors, and found that confidence thresholds liberalise following prior-congruent stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. These results show that priors influence confidence, but still cannot answer how optimal this influence is, and how it compares to the influence on decisions. In order to understand how our sense of confidence arises across different situations in which we may have highly informative prior expectations, as well as to rigorously test Bayesian confidence models, it is critical to understand quantitatively how priors are weighted relative to likelihoods in confidence computations, and how this relates to their weighting in decisions. More broadly, due to the pervasive role of priors in our processing, studies assessing the Bayesian confidence model under informative priors are important for generalizability.</p><p id="P5">Here, we examined (1) whether the use of prior information is optimal relative to the use of new sensory information, and (2) regardless of optimality, whether prior information is used the same way at the level of decisions and confidence. We did this both behaviourally and by fitting a generative Bayesian model with free weighting parameters that allowed us to quantify the relative use of priors at the level of decisions and confidence. Additionally, we assessed whether any possible asymmetries in the use of the prior at these different processing levels could be explained by differences in evidence accumulation time.</p><p id="P6">In two experiments, participants completed a gamified dual-decision task in which they made right/left decisions about two consecutive dot motion stimuli per trial. Critically, participants were informed about the added rule that, following correct responses to the first (‘lead’) stimulus, the second (‘target’) stimulus would go to the right. Conversely, incorrect decisions about the lead stimulus would be followed by leftwards-moving target stimuli. This meant that, in an optimal Bayesian observer, the prior expectation for a rightward target stimulus would be equal to the decision confidence about the lead stimulus. In other words, if participants were very confident that their response to the lead stimulus was correct, they would have a very strong prior that the target would be a rightward stimulus. Conversely, if participants were very unsure about their response to the lead, they would have equal expectations that the target would go right or leftwards. A dual-decision task with this same rule was used recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> to investigate the influence of the prior on the decision level, which was interpreted as a measure of implicit confidence. Here we build on that work in order to assess the potentially differential role of priors in decisions and in explicit, subjective confidence ratings.</p><p id="P7">In our design, we also made use of the task structure in order to be able to vary the strength of priors and likelihoods on the same dimension. Only this way could we directly, behaviourally compare the relative influence of priors and likelihoods on responses. We did this by building two conditions that were matched in the amount of total available posterior information, but differed in whether the lead or target was more informative. This allowed us to measure whether accuracy, confidence, and metacognitive efficiency differed between these two conditions, which could indicate either over- or underweighting of the priors relative to likelihoods. Going further, in order to quantify that weighting in both decisions and confidence, and test the precise way in which the use of prior information might differ at these different processing levels, we fit a Bayesian model to the data with parameters capturing the weighting of the prior in decisions and confidence. In the second experiment, we then further investigated whether potential asymmetries between the weighting of priors in decisions versus confidence could be simply attributed to differences in processing time.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dual-Decision Task and Conditions</title><p id="P8">On each trial of the gamified dual-decision task, participants (N=21) saw two consecutive random dot motion stimuli and made a decision after each about whether the coherent motion was to the right or left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), followed finally by a confidence rating about the second decision. We told participants that their task was to herd a flock of sheep (represented as dots in the RDK stimulus) towards the barn on the right of the screen. We gamified the rule (linking correct lead-decision responses to rightwards-moving target stimuli) and asked participants to position a sheepdog by responding to the lead stimulus. If the sheepdog was in the correct place, the sheep (coherently moving dots) of the target stimulus would go to the right. This meant that participants’ internal decision confidence about the lead stimulus formed the strength of their prior for a rightward target stimulus. In this way, the strength of the prior could be manipulated by changing the coherence of the lead stimulus (with L: low, M: medium, or H: high coherence), and the strength of the likelihood could be manipulated by changing the coherence of the target stimulus (also L, M, or H). This allowed us to create two conditions with the same available posterior information to the optimal observer (‘posterior level’): One in which there was more prior information due to a stronger lead stimulus (Stronger-Lead) and one in which there was more new sensory information due to a stronger target stimulus (Stronger-Target) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These two conditions existed in matched pairs across three overall levels of available posterior information (L<sub>post</sub>: L+M or M+L, M<sub>post</sub>: L+H or H+L, and H<sub>post</sub>: M+H or M+H). With this experimental design, we were able to assess whether participants’ accuracy, confidence and metacognitive performance depended on the condition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Manipulation Check</title><p id="P9">We first ensured that response accuracy increased with increasing coherence of the stimuli, indicating that we effectively manipulated internal signal strength as intended. Additionally, we investigated whether participants used the task structure as we wanted them to, using the rule and hence their prior to guide their target decisions, at least to some extent. If this were true, we expected participants to perform better on the target decisions of each trial, on which they had additional information from the prior (lead stimulus) to guide their choice. To test both these predictions we built a logistic regression model on response accuracy with fixed effects of information level (L, M, H), decision order (lead or target), and their interactions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for the model syntax). We found a significant interaction between decision order and information level (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(2)=43.53, p&lt;0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=9.71 × 10<sup>4</sup>), with differences between information levels reduced in the target decisions. However, post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that response accuracy remained significantly higher with increasing information levels for both decisions (all p&lt;0.001), suggesting our coherence manipulation to work as planned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, response accuracy was higher in the target decision compared to the lead decision at each information level, and this was significant at the low and medium information levels (both p&lt;0.001), revealing appropriate use of the task structure.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dependence on Condition Reveals Suboptimal Prior Weighting in Decisions</title><p id="P10">After confirming that the manipulations worked as intended, we investigated the use of prior information in decisions. We reasoned that, if the prior were suboptimally weighted at the decision level, performance on the target decision would depend on the condition despite matched posterior information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To evaluate this, we built a logistic mixed effects model on target decision response accuracy. This included fixed effects of posterior level (L, M, H), condition (Stronger-Lead, Stronger-Target), and their interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We did not find a significant interaction effect. In line with our manipulation check, we found a significant main effect of posterior level (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(2)=175.77, p&lt;0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=6.12 × 10<sup>36</sup>), with accuracy increasing with higher available posterior information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also found a significant main effect of condition, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=9.06, p=0.003, BF<sub>10</sub>=8.95, with better performance when the target was stronger, OR<sub>Stronger-Lead/Stronger-Target</sub>=0.89, 95% CI [0.82, 0.96], Z=-3.09, p=0.002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that, despite an equal amount of available posterior information, participants performed better when more of that information was carried by the target stimulus, rather than the lead stimulus, indicating that they dismissed some of the prior information when making their decisions. In other words, this revealed an underweighted use of the prior at the decision level, relative to an optimal observer. Because there was potential for response bias to lead to differences in accuracy across the conditions regardless of how the prior information was weighted, we reran this model, including a measure of response bias obtained from fitting subject-wise psychometric functions to performance on the unbiased first decisions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>). This did not substantially change the result or conclusions, as there were no significant effects involving response bias.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Analysis of Mean Confidence Reveals Greater Use of Priors Than in Decisions</title><p id="P11">We then built a linear mixed effects model on confidence with fixed effects of posterior level (L, M, H), condition (Stronger-Lead, Stronger-Target), target response accuracy (Correct, Incorrect), and their interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We found evidence for a three-way interaction from Bayesian statistics BF<sub>10</sub>=70.83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) but only a trend from frequentist tests (F(2,14832)=2.66, p=0.070). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed a significant effect of condition on confidence only for incorrect trials at the high posterior level, t(1281)=-3.52, p&lt;0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=6.14, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>=0.01, and medium posterior level, t(839)=-2.16, p=0.03, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>=0.006, although the Bayesian statistics suggest evidence against the effect at the medium level (BF<sub>10</sub>=0.46). There were no significant effects of the condition following correct trials, with evidence for the null hypothesis at all posterior levels (all BF&lt;0.02). Because the suboptimal weighting of the prior at the decision level can impact confidence distributions, a statistically significant effect of condition on confidence cannot be interpreted in isolation. Instead, we must consider the decision level result as a baseline. Simulations shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure. 4A</xref>, third panel) revealed that, given any underweighting of the prior in decisions, the following pattern holds: If the prior was even further underweighted in confidence than in decisions, we would expect confidence in the Stronger-Target condition to be higher following correct trials and lower following incorrect trials. Contrary to this, the result of no difference following correct trials and lower confidence in the Stronger-Lead condition following incorrect trials indicates that the prior is less underweighted than at the decision level, and is hence used more optimally in confidence. To quantify this effect and concretely compare the weighting of the prior at the decision versus confidence level, we used computational modelling. Further in line with this idea, we found significantly higher M-Ratios in the Stronger-Lead condition (M=0.87, SD=0.27) than in the Stronger-Target condition (M=0.71, SD=0.25), t(16)=3.64, p=0.002, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>=0.01, 95% CI [0.14, 1.00] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the relative use of priors and likelihoods is more optimal at the metacognitive level than at the level of decisions.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Bayesian Model Fits Different Weights of Priors in Confidence and Decisions</title><p id="P12">Overall, the behavioural analyses revealed that, while decisions underweighted the available prior information, confidence seemed to use the prior information more optimally. To account for these results, and to be able to compare the effects at these two levels of processing more directly and quantitatively, we use a computational model. We built and fit a Bayesian model of decisions and confidence under informative priors that included a weighting parameter for the prior (relative to the likelihood), for both the decision (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub>) and the confidence rating (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>). These weighting parameters reflected potential over- or underestimation of the precision of the prior, hence weighting its influence over behaviour relative to the likelihood. They were also computationally identical in their impact, scaling the perceived variance of the prior, allowing us to directly compare them. We first estimated internal noise and decision bias (not under the influence of a prior) per participant on separate data using the Akaike-weighted combination of four fit psychometric functions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>), and then incorporated these subject-wise estimates into the model, allowing us to account for them. The model additionally included a parameter for confidence bias (<italic>b</italic>) that captured overall over- or underconfidence in both stimuli. The model had three free parameters (per participant and at the group level): <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub>, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>, and <italic>b</italic>. We confirmed the parameters to be recoverable in a parameter recovery analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). We also compared our full model, which we call the Flexible model, to a variety of simpler models, to assess each main research question in more depth.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Flexible Model Results</title><p id="P13">At the decision level, the model predicted that if the prior was optimally weighted relative to the likelihood, (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> = 1), there would be no difference in accuracy between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). If the prior was overweighted (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> &lt; 1, capturing an underestimation of the variance of the prior), accuracy would be higher when the lead was the stronger stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel). Conversely, if the prior was underweighted (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> &gt; 1), accuracy would be higher when the target was the stronger stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). The full hierarchical model fit the data with a mean of the posterior for the group mean parameter <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> = 2.17 (SE=0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests, in line with the behavioural results, that priors are underweighted in decisions, relative to an optimal observer. The simulated choice behaviour for these model results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> (right panel) and demonstrates higher accuracy when the target is the stronger stimulus, just as we found behaviourally.</p><p id="P14">We then examined the model predictions for confidence, given the result of the underweighted priors in decisions (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub>&gt;1). With overweighting of the prior in confidence (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>&lt;1), the Stronger-Lead condition tends to show higher confidence than the Stronger-Target condition for correct trials, and lower for incorrect trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle-left panel). In other words, the differences in mean confidence between correct and incorrect are larger in the Stronger-Lead condition than in the Stonger-Target condition. The model predicts these differences between conditions to become more extreme as the prior is weighted more strongly in confidence (as <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> decreases). In contrast, with underweighting of the prior (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>&gt;1), it is the Stronger-Target condition that tends to have larger differences in mean confidence between correct and incorrect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle-right panel). Again, the model predicts this pattern to get more extreme as the prior is weighted more weakly (as <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> increases). If the prior weighting in both decisions and confidence were optimal, the model predicts no difference in mean confidence between conditions. However, due to the suboptimal weighting found at the decision level, the model predicts differences between conditions with optimal <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> = 1, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, far-left panel. The behavioural pattern seen in confidence — of no difference between conditions following correct trials, and lower confidence following incorrect trials in the Stronger-Lead condition — can only be produced if the prior is weighted more strongly in confidence than in the decision, and the model predicts such a pattern when the prior is underweighted, but less so than in decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, far-right panel).</p><p id="P15">Due to complexity constraints, we modelled confidence on each trial assuming that the internal signal corresponded to the mean external stimulus strengths from each stimulus coherence level (L, M, H). That is, we did not fit the internal latent samples that are theoretically generated from the external stimuli, as that would have led to an overparameterized model with two free parameters per individual trial (totalling close to 30000 free parameters). This simplification still included a parameter that corresponded to the internal noise for each participant, which was used in the confidence computation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>). As a result of this simplification, the model underestimated mean confidence and impacted primarily the confidence bias parameter <italic>b</italic>. However, this still allowed the model to capture differences between conditions, and hence our parameter of interest, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>. Additionally, we confirmed that any impact that this had on <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> worked directly against our conclusions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>), making our interpretations more conservative.</p><p id="P16">The fit hierarchical model had a mean posterior of the group parameter <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> = 1.27 (SE=0.002), and of the group bias <italic>b</italic> = 2.18 (SE=0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This, in line with the behavioural results, suggests the weighting of the prior in confidence to be closer to optimal, compared to the weighting of the prior in decisions. The simulated confidence for these model results at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) successfully captures the pattern associated with the combination of an underweighted prior in decisions and a less underweighted prior in confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, far-right panel).</p><p id="P17">Finally, we directly compared the relative weighting of priors and likelihoods at the decision and confidence level. <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> was credibly different from <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>, with the difference distribution just excluding 0 in the 89% credible interval [0.03, 1.77] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This again suggests the weighting of priors relative to likelihoods to differ at the level of decisions and confidence.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Flexible Model Describes Behaviour Better Than Simpler Models</title><p id="P18">We then compared the Flexible model to simpler models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We confirmed these models to be distinguishable from one another with a model recovery analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In addition to the (1) Flexible model, we built (2) the Flat Prior model in which the lead stimulus information was not used at all and the target stimuli were considered to occur under a flat prior (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> infinitely large), (3) the Optimal model in which <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> were both optimal (equal to 1), and (4) the Equal model in which the prior was forced to be used to the same extent in decisions and confidence (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub>=<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>) and hence only one <italic>w</italic> parameter was fit. All models included confidence bias as a free parameter. We fit these models and compared their predictive performance against the Flexible model using a 10-fold leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV, where ‘groups’ correspond to participants). The Flexible model predicted the data better than each of the other models, with a difference in expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd_diff) of -619688.2 (se_diff=16717.0) compared to the Flat Prior model, of -11017.7 (se_diff=4534.4) compared to the Optimal model, and of -76685.8 (se_diff=2147.4) compared to the Equal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The results of this formal model comparison are in line with both the behavioural and the modelling results shown above: The difference to the Flat Prior model confirmed that participants used the prior information to some extent, in line with our behavioural manipulation check. The difference to the Optimal model confirmed that participants used the prior information suboptimally. And, the difference to the Equal model confirmed that participants used the prior information to a different extent in confidence than in decisions, in line with our finding of a credible difference between <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="S11"><title>Dual-Decision Task with Delayed Target Decision</title><p id="P20">The finding from Experiment 1, that priors can be used more optimally in confidence, might support the idea that priors are integrated gradually, and that there is continued post-decisional evidence accumulation that can then factor into confidence. This would be in line with previous work suggesting that confidence computations incorporate additional information that has accumulated after the first-order decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it is possible that the additional use of the prior in confidence is by virtue of the introspective act, and not simply due to continued evidence accumulation. In support for the latter alternative, previous work found enhanced metacognitive efficiency following prior congruency, showing information from priors to especially boost metacognitive judgments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In order to investigate these two possibilities further, we ran a second pre-registered experiment (N=25) in which we repeated the same paradigm under the same conditions, but we added a 2-second delay after the offset of the target stimulus and before participants were allowed to report their target decision. We chose the duration of the delay to approximately match the peak of the distribution of reaction times between viewing the target stimulus and giving the confidence rating from Experiment 1, which was 2.48 seconds. Therefore, if in Experiment 1 the more optimal use of the priors in confidence was only due to the extra processing time before giving the confidence rating, then delaying the target decision until that time point in Experiment 2 should lead to more optimal use of the prior information in the delayed target decision. If, however, the more optimal use of the prior was due to the introspective confidence rating, delaying the target decision in Experiment 2 should not change the pattern of results.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Priors Underweighted in Decisions Despite Increased Processing Time</title><p id="P21">We ran the same regression model on target response accuracy as in Experiment 1 and found a significant interaction between posterior level and condition, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(2)=8.21, p=0.017, BF<sub>10</sub>=2.68. In line with Experiment 1, response accuracy was higher in the Stronger-Target condition at each posterior level, although this was only significant at the medium posterior level, z=-4.30, p&lt;0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=138.49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests the prior to be underweighted in the target decisions, even after the delay and hence the added opportunity for evidence accumulation (for behavioural data, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). To examine whether the same pattern of more optimal use of priors in confidence remained, we again fit the Flexible model, this time as confirmatory modelling analyses. Replicating the pattern found in Experiment 1, we found a mean of the posterior of <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> = 3.97 (SE=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and a mean of the posterior of <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> = 1.39 (SE=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), with a credible difference between them [0.50, 4.64] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that prior information is underweighted in decisions even when those decisions occur at a similar time point as the confidence judgments in Experiment 1, and, like in Experiment 1, confidence then more optimally uses that prior information.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">In two experiments, we tested whether prior information influences confidence optimally, and how this compares to its influence on perceptual decisions. To do so, we compared pairs of conditions that were matched in the available posterior information but differed on whether the stronger source of information was the prior or the new incoming information. We then evaluated the differences between conditions (Stronger-Lead vs Stronger-Target) in both discrimination accuracy and mean confidence, and fit a quantitative model to measure the weighting of prior information. This revealed that priors are underweighted relative to likelihoods in discrimination decisions. Conversely, confidence judgments incorporated prior information to a greater extent than discrimination decisions did. Further, and in line with the idea that prior information is processed more optimally at the metacognitive level, we found that metacognitive efficiency was higher when more information was carried by the prior, with first-order performance hindered while confidence preserved the use of this information. Taken together, these results suggest that we can access and use information from priors in explicit, introspective confidence judgments even to a greater extent than we use that information to guide decisions.</p><p id="P23">This pattern goes against the assumptions, implicit in the Bayesian framework, of optimal and equal integration of priors in decisions and confidence. While participants may not necessarily be expected to behave as Bayesian optimal observers, these findings quantify precisely in which way they deviate from those assumptions. Although the underweighted prior in decisions may, in isolation, be explainable by a decay of the prior information over time, such a decay would make the asymmetry between the decision and confidence levels even more surprising, as the confidence judgments occurred even later. The results of Experiment 2 revealed, further, that this asymmetry remains even when additional processing time is given by forcing a delay before the target decision. This suggests that this pattern cannot be accounted for just by continued evidence accumulation before the confidence rating, since a similar amount of evidence accumulation should have occurred between the confidence ratings in Experiment 1 and the target decisions in Experiment 2. Instead, this points towards a more optimal use of prior information at the metacognitive level, compared to first-order processing. In line with this, Balsdon and colleagues demonstrated asymmetries in the information used by decisions and confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. They used series of stimuli and found decisions to set covert bounds and stop collecting new evidence, while confidence used more of the available information. In light of those findings, our work shows a similar effect, where decisions make use of less of the information available than confidence does. However, here, we find that it is prior information that is more strongly dismissed in decisions.</p><p id="P24">These results add a novel layer to recent findings by Lisi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, who focussed on implicit, not explicit confidence. They, as we did, found priors to be underweighted at the level of the decision, but could not assess whether explicit confidence weighted them differently than decisions. Here we reveal important differences in how the prior is used at different processing levels, by examining the weighting of the prior in explicit confidence as well. Our results suggest that, even though the prior is underweighted in a decision, people can access and use this information better when asked to make an explicit introspective judgment about that decision. A cognitive architecture in which perceptual decisions can primarily respond to current incoming evidence while higher order metacognitive processing integrates different sources of information and monitors their relative certainty might be highly adaptive. For example, it might be beneficial to react rapidly and in accordance with evidence for even an unlikely belief if that would pose some threat, meanwhile having the metacognitive system accurately track its posterior probability for appropriate models of the world. Our results therefore provide crucial insight on a dissociation between human behaviour and associated confidence.</p><p id="P25">In this study, we used a paradigm with informative, high level priors. Future work is necessary to investigate whether this result holds true when different kinds of priors are used. First, lower-level priors such as the light-from-above prior, cardinal orientation bias, or perceptual history bias might affect decisions differently, as they may act at an earlier stage and impact perception of the target stimulus more directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Second, non-informative or suboptimal priors might reveal that the pattern we see here reflects a confidence bias towards prior information, rather than more optimal use of priors in confidence. If so, in cases of suboptimal priors, confidence would still be more likely to be affected by the invalid prior information than decisions. This possibility is in line with recent studies that have shown that confidence is biased by suboptimal, false priors about stimulus precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> or about task performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Other work testing the Bayesian confidence model has found confidence to suboptimally overweight evidence that is in line with the decision, leading to a form of confirmation bias in perceptual confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Our findings do not show a confirmation bias in favour of information in line with the decision, but might rather reflect a confidence confirmation bias in favour of information in line with the prior, even in cases where this actually contradicts the decision. Although at face value this may go against the previous confirmation bias findings in perceptual confidence, this might, speculatively, still be in line with the conclusions drawn, namely that confidence favours evidence consistent with one’s beliefs. This could also be a strategy aimed at self-consistency and avoiding cognitive dissonance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, leading people to be more confident in response to information that fits in their belief system, and to doubt themselves when they act against their prior world models.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P26">Both experiments were pre-registered (Experiment 1: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/qgpsr">https://osf.io/qgpsr</ext-link> and Experiment 2: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/tvyrz">https://osf.io/tvyrz</ext-link>), and we respected the pre-registered plan unless stated otherwise.</p><sec id="S15" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P27">For Experiment 1, we pre-registered that we would test 25 participants across two sessions.

We also pre-registered six minimal criteria to invite participants to the second session. The most important of these criteria were (1) that response accuracy increased across the three coherence levels — hence suggesting that the experimental manipulation had the intended effect on internal signals —, and (2) that response accuracy was (any amount) higher on the second decisions as compared to the first, indicating basic use of the task structure. Following these criteria, we excluded 12 participants without inviting them to take part in the second session, and collected data until we reached 25 participants that met these criteria and were tested for two sessions. Four of these participants were later excluded from analysis because they no longer met these basic criteria after including data from their second session, leaving a total of 21 participants (10 male, 11 female) included in the analyses.

Each trial of the control task consisted of a single dot motion stimulus with a 50% chance of the coherent motion going to the right vs left, followed by a right/left decision, which participants made using the “S” or “A” keys, respectively. The stimuli in the control task spanned six different coherences, meant to capture a broad range of difficulties - 5%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 20% and 30% coherence. The resulting data were later used to estimate participants’ internal noise and decision bias (see below). In total across the two sessions, participants completed 180 control task trials (30 per coherence level). After the control task, we explained the instructions for the full task structure to participants both verbally and in written instructions, and they then completed five demo trials to familiarise themselves with the task and buttons, and then proceeded to the main task.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Main Task</title><p id="P31">On each trial of the main task, participants completed two consecutive decisions consisting of a random dot motion stimulus followed by a right/left decision using the “S” or “A” keys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first (lead) stimulus of each trial had a 50% chance of the coherent motion going to the right vs left. The direction of coherent motion of the second (target) stimulus depended deterministically on the response accuracy of the first decision such that if they were correct, the second stimulus would have coherent motion to the right, and if they were incorrect, it would have coherent motion to the left. Participants were informed of this rule and instructed to use this to help them in the task. Following an optimal strategy, this conditional rule meant that participants should expect a rightward second stimulus with a strength of prior expectation proportional to their decision confidence about the first decision. Following the second decision, participants rated their confidence on a continuous sliding scale from 50% (guessing) to 100% (totally sure), using the mouse. The dual-decision task structure with the conditional rule was an extension of a previous study investigating implicit confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">The task was gamified to make it more engaging. The background of the screen was an illustration of fields with a barn to the right, and the stimulus display circle in the middle of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first decision controlled the movement of a cartoon sheepdog to the right or left of the stimulus display, and the second decision controlled the movement of a cartoon farmer to the right or left of the stimulus display. We explained to participants that the moving dot stimuli depicted flocks of sheep, with some “leader” sheep that moved coherently to either the left or right, and that they had to decide based on the motion direction of the leader sheep whether to send their sheepdog to the left or right. Participants were explicitly informed of the rule: If they were correct, and hence the sheepdog was in the correct place, the sheep would be herded toward the barn and on the next stimulus, they would be going to the right. If, however, they were incorrect and the sheepdog was not in the correct place, the sheep would run away and on the next stimulus, they would be going to the left. After the second stimulus, participants then had to make the final decision to either send the farmer to the barn (to the right) to get the sheep, or to send the farmer to herd them from the fields to the left. They then rated their confidence that the farmer had successfully gotten the sheep. We emphasised to participants that they should use the rule to try to help them with the task, and that they should take time to give as sensitive and meaningful confidence ratings as possible.</p><p id="P33">We manipulated the coherences of the stimuli to create three stimulus levels, and the coherence levels of each of the two stimuli per trial combined to form three overall posterior levels. The low posterior information level consisted of one low and one medium coherence stimulus (L+M or M+L), the medium posterior information level consisted of one low and one high coherence stimulus (L+H or H+L), and the high posterior information level consisted of one medium and one high coherence stimulus (M+H or H+M). These posterior information levels existed across two conditions, a “Stronger-Lead” condition in which the lead stimulus was stronger, and a “Stronger-Target” condition in which the target stimulus was stronger. The stimulus coherence levels were staircased by staircasing lead stimuli, which were not under the influence of an informative prior, with the medium level staircased via a 2-down-1-up procedure targeting 71% accuracy, and the high level staircased via a 3-down-1-up procedure targeting 79% accuracy. The low level was yoked to the medium staircase, but remained 5% lower in coherence, as there was no N-down-1-up procedure that would target an accuracy between 50% and 71%. The three posterior information levels as well as the condition were counterbalanced across each block. Participants received feedback about their performance on the target decisions at the end of each block. Each block consisted of 36 trials, and participants completed 10 blocks per session for a total of 360 trials per session and 720 trials in the experiment.

Participants were instructed to try and avoid pressing a key prematurely during the delay period, although trials with premature presses were not excluded.

Each dot had a radius of 2 pixels and the background circle had a diameter of 425 pixels, with an aperture diameter of 319 pixels (75% of the circle diameter). The noise dots had constant directions that were randomly sampled, and the coherent dots moved in a constant horizontal direction either to the left or right. All dots moved 2 pixels per frame and had a dot life of 17 frames (i.e., each dot followed their trajectory for 17 frames before being redrawn at a random location). Each stimulus was presented for 300 ms. Although some directional information was possible in the random dots of each stimulus, we confirmed that this did not lead to an overall bias in any participant, so that stimulus directions remained balanced between left and right (for the lead decision, where they were intended to be 50/50), even with the directional information from the noise dots.

These parameters acted in the same way in the model, scaling the estimate of the variance of the prior, and could hence be directly compared. The model also took as input a measure of the internal noise and decision bias per subject, which were fit independently using psychometric functions. All models were hierarchically structured and fit to all participants’ trial-wise decisions and confidence ratings together using an Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach in STAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and with the ‘cmdstanr’ package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

The four psychometric functions were (1) a simple function that included only the internal noise as a free parameter, (2) a function with internal noise as well as decision bias, (3) a function with internal noise as well as a lapse term, and finally (4) a function that included internal noise, decision bias, as well as lapse. The lapse term accounted for the possibility that participants might have made stimulus-independent lapses such as attentional or motor lapses.

A. Gamified dual-decision paradigm.</title><p>On each trial, participants viewed and made right/left decisions about two consecutive dot motion stimuli (lead and target), which they were told represented flocks of sheep. We explicitly informed participants that if they were correct about the first decision, then the target stimulus would be going to the right, and if incorrect, then it would be going to the left. This meant that, in an optimal observer, the prior for a rightward target stimulus should be equal to the lead decision certainty. They also rated their confidence in the target decision. In Experiment 2, the paradigm was the same except there was a 2-second delay after viewing the target stimulus, before participants were allowed to make the target decision. <bold>B.

We manipulated the coherence of the lead and target stimuli (each of which could have L: low, M: medium, or H: high coherence), here depicted with the circle transparency, to create two conditions that had matched available posterior information but differed in whether the lead or target stimulus was stronger. This was tested at three overall posterior levels - low posterior information (L+M), medium posterior information (L+H), and high posterior information (M+H). <bold>C. Sketch of the Stronger-Lead vs Stronger-Target Manipulation</bold>. The posterior percept (orange) should optimally be the precision-weighted integration of the prior (yellow), which in our task was always rightward and could span from 50-100%, and likelihood (red). Both conditions led to the same available amount of posterior information, which (in the optimal case) leads to the same probability of a correct choice as well as confidence. Hence, the target accuracy and confidence will only differ between conditions if the two sources of information are not integrated optimally in the decisions and/or confidence. Note that this is only a sketch aimed at conveying the intuition of how the conditions were matched in terms of posterior information. The prior for a rightward target stimulus is captured more accurately by a step function, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156296-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Behavioural Results.

Accuracy was also higher in the target decisions compared to the lead decisions, suggesting at least some use of the task structure and prior information. In the raincloud plots, the right-half, split violin plots show the probability density, and vertical black lines show the median, IQR, hinges showing the first and third quartiles, and vertical whiskers showing +/- 1.5IQR. The binned dotplots on the left half show each individual subject as a point. <bold>B. Effect of condition on accuracy</bold>. We found a significant effect of the condition (which stimulus was stronger) on accuracy, despite matched available posterior information, suggesting participants to give suboptimal relative weights to priors and likelihoods in their decisions. Participants performed significantly better in the Stronger-Target condition (M<sub>L_Stronger-Target</sub>=0.72, SD=0.05; M<sub>M_Stronger-Target</sub> =0.79, SD=0.04; M<sub>H_ Stronger-Target</sub> =0.84, SD=0.04) compared to the Stronger-Lead condition (M<sub>L_Stronger-Lead</sub>=0.70, SD=0.05; M<sub>M_Stronger-Lead</sub>=0.76, SD=0.05; M<sub>H_Stronger-Lead</sub>=0.81, SD=0.05), pointing to a relative underweighting of prior information. <bold>C. Effect of condition on confidence</bold>. We found no effect of condition on confidence following correct trials (with mean differences between conditions – Stronger-Target minus Stronger-Lead – of: M<sub>L</sub>=0.15, SD=2.19; M<sub>M</sub>=0.40, SD=2.34; M<sub>H</sub>=-0.07, SD=2.15). But, we found an effect of condition following incorrect trials, with lower confidence in the Stronger-Lead condition (with mean differences between conditions – Stronger-Target minus Stronger-Lead – of: M<sub>L</sub>=0.66, SD=2.51; M<sub>M</sub>=1.98, SD=2.50; M<sub>H</sub>=3.15, SD=2.54). From the decision level as a baseline, this result indicates greater use of the prior in confidence than in decisions. <bold>D. M-Ratio estimates</bold>. M-Ratios per participant for each condition, measured across all posterior levels. As expected if (as panels B. and C. suggest) valid prior information informed confidence ratings more than discrimination decisions, M-Ratios were significantly higher in the Stronger-Lead condition than in the Stronger-Target condition.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156296-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Modelling Discrimination Decisions.

These values are representative of the range found in the data, and capture either over- or underestimated variance by a factor of 3. The resulting decision accuracies are shown here. The model predicts that optimally using prior information will lead to no difference in accuracy between the two conditions, whereas overweighting prior information will lead to higher accuracy when the lead is stronger, and underweighting prior information will lead to higher accuracy when the target is stronger. <bold>B.

A. Model simulations of confidence.</title><p>Confidence ratings following correct and incorrect trials were simulated from the model across different posterior information levels, between the two conditions. Simulations used the <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> value from the model fit, 2.17, and four different values of <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>: 1 (optimal weighting of prior), 0.33 (3-fold overweighting of the prior), 3 (3-fold underweighting of the prior), and 1.27 (the value obtained from the model fit, underweighting the prior in confidence less than in the decision), shown from left to right respectively. The resulting mean confidence values are shown here. The model predicts mean confidence to increase with increased available posterior information following correct decisions and decrease with increased available posterior information following incorrect trials. As the prior is increasingly overweighted, the model predicts higher mean confidence in the Stronger-Lead condition following correct decisions, and lower in the Stronger-Lead condition following incorrect decisions. As the prior is increasingly underweighted, the opposite pattern is predicted, with higher mean confidence in the Stronger-Target condition following correct trials, and lower confidence in the Stronger-Target condition following incorrect trials. If the prior weighting was optimal in both decisions and confidence, there would be no differences predicted in mean confidence between conditions. However, due to the suboptimal weighting at the decision level, the model predicts differences in mean confidence when <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub> is optimal, as shown in the far-left panel. When the prior is underweighted in confidence, but less so than in the decision, the model can produce the pattern seen behaviourally, in which there is no difference between conditions following correct trials, but lower confidence in the Stronger-Lead condition following incorrect trials. <bold>B.

The lead stimulus then generated an internal response with some added internal noise, which formed the likelihood distribution and then the posterior. The area of the posterior on the chosen side of the decision boundary (vertical dashed line) corresponds to the confidence in the lead decision (<italic>conf</italic><sub><italic>lead</italic></sub>), captured by area A (Stronger-Lead condition panel) or B (Stronger-Target condition panel). This confidence in the lead decision then formed the strength of the prior for a rightward target stimulus. The target stimulus generated an internal response that formed the target likelihood, and the prior was then integrated with the target likelihood to give the posterior for the target (orange). This posterior then led to the target decision and confidence rating. The strength of the posterior probability of the winning hypothesis, depicted by the opaque orange area, is based on the combination of the strength of the prior – from the confidence in the lead stimulus – and the strength of the likelihood – from the confidence in the target stimulus. Our two conditions, Stronger-Lead (left) and Stronger-Target (right), simply swapped the strengths of the lead versus target stimulus. But, the confidence in these stimuli (areas A and B) still combine to the same posterior strength (A*B or B*A). Hence, the model predicted equal accuracy and mean confidence between conditions, if the relative weighting of priors and likelihoods was optimal. The weighting parameters, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>choice</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>conf</italic></sub>, acted by scaling the estimated variance of the lead, effectively scaling <italic>conf</italic><sub><italic>lead</italic></sub> and capturing the strength of prior for a rightward target that best explains target decisions and confidence ratings, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156296-f007"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Regression Models</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle">Analysis</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Hypothesis</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Model Formula</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Manipulation Check</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Accuracy depends on information level and on which decision it is (Lead Decision vs Target Decision).</td><td align="left" valign="middle">logit(Response Accuracy) ~ Information Level * Decision Order + (1|Participant)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Type 1 Analysis</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Target accuracy depends on posterior information level and, if priors are used suboptimally, on the condition (Stronger-Lead vs Stronger-Target).</td><td align="left" valign="middle">logit(Target Response Accuracy) ~ Posterior Level * Condition * Response Bias + (1|Participant</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Type 2 Analysis</td><td align="left" valign="middle">If priors are used suboptimally, condition modulates the effect of posterior information on confidence differently following correct and incorrect target decisions.</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Confidence ~ Posterior Level * Condition * Target Response Accuracy * Response Bias + (Target Response Accuracy + Condition|Participant)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
