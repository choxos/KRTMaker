Here, we explore the circuit mechanisms that guide approach or avoidance behavior in mice based on the valence of previous social interactions. We identify a novel circuit connecting D1 receptor expressing neurons of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) to D1R expressing neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These cells become active during social interactions in a valence-dependent manner. Lower frequency patterns encoded appetitive interactions, while aversive interactions led to higher activation. These activity patterns elicited distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in the accumbal target neurons, which were causal for subsequent approach or avoidance behavior. Our results unravel the synaptic mechanisms instructing behavior after the social interaction of opposite valence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Understanding how individuals navigate social interactions is crucial for the survival of all species, relying on the ability to discern between positive and negative experiences, a concept known as social valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Following an initial interaction, information gained helps an individual decide whether to approach or avoid a particular individual in the future. This process has been extensively studied, nevertheless the brain circuits contributing to assigning valence and learning from the experience to take the appropriate decision remain elusive. Within the mesolimbic system, the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) contributes to the learning process by updating future behavior by guiding decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Although the NAc has been implicated in both rewarding and aversive social experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) how it discriminates between social valence is still a matter of debate. Here we design a paradigm that allows us to investigate the neuronal mechanisms that occur when an individual enters in contact with another to assign the valence and learn to approach or avoidance behavior based on the experience.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Juvenile and CD1 interactions are classified as rewarding or aversive experiences</title><p id="P3">We first exposed male mice to a sex-matched juvenile or an adult aggressive CD1 mouse for 15 minutes, using an inanimate object as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The following day, we placed the same stimuli in an enclosure within a corridor arena. We measured the time the experimental mouse spent near that enclosure during the pre-test and post-test phases. Mice showed increased interaction time with juvenile mice (indicating approach behavior) and decreased time spent near the aggressive CD1 mice (indicating avoidance behavior) during the test phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). To confirm that avoidance was induced by a negative experience, we exposed mice to a non-aggressive CD1 mouse. In this case, no avoidance behavior was observed (fig. s1, A to C). Since aggression is necessary to trigger avoidance, we hypothesized that contact bouts during the specific interaction with a conspecific are responsible for inducing approach and avoidance behaviors. Therefore, we manually classified contact interaction bouts between the mice on day 1 as either positive or negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Interactions with juvenile mice were predominantly characterized by positive bouts, whereas most bouts with CD1 mice were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). To extend our analysis across the entire dataset, we employed Simple Behavioural Analysis (SimBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Based on this comprehensive data analysis, we classify the experience with the juvenile mouse as rewarding and the experience with the CD1 mouse as aversive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>D1-expressing neurons of Lateral NAc shell (LNAc) encoded proximity regardless of the valence</title><p id="P4">To study how D1R-containing MSNs compute social valence, we focused on LNAc. It has been shown that subdivisions of the NAc can exert opposing effects on motivated behavior, with the lateral portion of the NAc shell encoding rewarding and aversive experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). We used miniature microscope to record the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) activity of individual D1-MSNs during rewarding and aversive social experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients increased during social experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity increased when social stimuli were in proximity to the experimental mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D to F</xref> and fig. s2, A to D), regardless of the identity of the stimulus and of the contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>, fig s3). Notably, 74.6% of neurons exhibited increased activity during rewarding and aversive experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Since there were no discernible differences in z-score activity between the two experiences, we analyzed of the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect any variations in frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). However, no distinctions were observed between rewarding and aversive social experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, I to K</xref>). Thus far, our findings indicate that LNAc D1-MSNs encode conspecific proximity regardless of the valence.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>AIC-NAc projecting neurons encoded the social context</title><p id="P5">We used a neural activity-dependent labeling approach to investigate the inputs that drive D1-MSN activity during rewarding and aversive social experiences. We injected Fos-cre-ERT2 mice in the LNAc with a retro-AAV-FLEX-tdTomato virus and, four weeks later, exposed the mice to non-social, rewarding, or aversive stimuli for 15 minutes, followed by tamoxifen administration (fig. s4A). We identified neurons activated in different rostro-caudal subdivisions of the insular cortex (anterior insular cortex - AIC, medial insular cortex - MIC, and posterior insular cortex - PIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and in the amygdala (fig. s4, B to C). The insular cortex has an integrative function, plays an essential role in salience processing and attention, and gates executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These functions are implicated in social behavior and valence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). By injecting a retrograde rabies virus into the LNAc, we found that only the anterior section of the insula projects monosynaptically to the D1-MSNs in the lateral part (fig. s5, A to D). To identify the identity of socially active neurons in the AIC that project to the LNAc, we used RNA scope in situ hybridization to double label c-Fos and Drd1 mRNA. We observed that 88.16% of juvenile-activated neurons and 81.4% of CD1-activated neurons were Drd1-positive (fig. s6, A and B). We confirmed these results using a bicolor virus approach, injecting AAVrg-ef1a-DO-DIOTdTomato-eGFP in the LNAc and labeling neurons in the AIC (fig. s6, C and D). According to these data, despite D1 positive and D1 negative neurons projecting to the LNAc, most neurons are activated by rewarding and aversive social experiences that contain D1Rs.</p><p id="P6">Next, we examined the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of D1-AIC neurons projecting to the LNAc during rewarding and aversive social experiences using the miniscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Notably, an overall increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was observed in D1-AIC neurons projecting to the LNAc in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). AIC to NAc projecting neurons showed increased activity during both positive and negative contacts, regardless of proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D to F</xref>, fig s7, C and D, fig s8) suggesting that the activity encodes for interaction rather than distance. Moreover, we identified a 67.5% overlap in the neuronal population that was active during both experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Given the absence of discernible differences in z-score activity between the two experiences, as we previously described, we employed FFT analysis to investigate frequency domain differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Contrary to the LNAc, we observed a shift in activity patterns from lower to higher frequency bands in the AIC when transitioning from rewarding to aversive experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I to K</xref>). These data suggest that the activity of AIC neurons projecting to LNAc differently encode the rewarding or aversive social experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Valence-dependent synaptic plasticity at AIC to LNAc synapses</title><p id="P7">Since mice learn to approach or avoid a conspecific depending on their experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), and because the AIC to LNAc pathway encodes social valence, we hypothesized that learning occurs through the induction of valence-specific forms of synaptic plasticity at excitatory inputs to the LNAc. Several studies indeed have linked synaptic strengthening with learned behaviors through modulation of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We first verified the specificity of the projection from D1-containing AIC neurons to D1-MSNs in the LNAc. We injected AAV-FLEX-ChR2 in AIC and AAV-FLEX-mCherry in the LNAc in D1-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref> and fig. s9A) and performed double whole cell patch clamp recording from labeled D1 positive and D1 negative neurons in the LNAc (fig. s9B). We found that D1-expressing AIC neurons preferentially projected to D1-MSN in the LNAc, revealing a top-down control (fig. s9, C and D). We then exposed mice to rewarding or aversive social experiences, performed whole-cell recordings from D1-MSNs in the LNAc 24h later while simultaneously recording excitatory inputs from the D1-containing neurons in the AIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). We measured the relative ratio of AMPAR to NMDAR mediated currents (AMPA/NMDA ratio) as a proxy of synaptic strength and rectification index of AMPARs to estimate the proportion of calcium-permeable receptors (CP-AMPARs). We observed an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio following rewarding social experiences and rectification after aversive social experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). Rewarding or aversive social interactions induce distinct synaptic plasticity at synapses between D1 receptor expressing neurons of the AIC and the LNAc (fig. s10, A to D).</p><p id="P8">Because of the FFT data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, I to K</xref>), we then hypothesize that valence-specific activity patterns at the AIC-LNAc pathway induce distinct synaptic plasticity forms during rewarding and aversive interactions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments in D1-Cre mice, injecting AAV-FLEX-ChR2 in the AIC and AAV-FLEX-mCherry in the NAc and bilaterally implanting optic fibers in the LNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). We applied 1 Hz or 10 Hz frequency stimulation to the AIC-LNAc pathway while stimulating the contralateral hemisphere at 0.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). After 24h of optogenetic stimulation, we conducted whole-cell patch clamp recording from D1-MSNs in the LNAc. We observed an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio after 1Hz stimulation and an increase in rectification index following 10 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, H and I</xref>). As concluded by these data, rewarding and aversive social experiences produce different activity patterns at the AIC and LNAc pathway and as consequence distinct forms of plasticity are elicited.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Valence-dependent synaptic plasticity controls subsequent approach behavior</title><p id="P9">Next, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of valence-specific synaptic plasticity at AIC to LNAc synapses in social approach and avoidance learning. We exposed experimental mice to reward social experience and applied 10Hz stimulation at the AIC to LNAc pathway during interaction contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>), replicating the pattern observed during aversive social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). We conducted the approach/avoidance test on the second day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) and performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of D1-MSNs in the LNAc while stimulating AIC inputs. In the control group, mice exhibited approach behavior towards the juvenile stimuli during the test phase. However, the approach behavior was abolished entirely in mice exposed to juvenile C57BL/6J and coupled with medium-frequency stimulation during contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Subsequently, we performed electrophysiological recordings from D1-MSNs in the same group of mice. We observed a notable disparity in the AMPA/NMDA ratio between the two groups. Specifically, the ratio recorded after interaction with juvenile C57BL/6J was significantly higher than that observed in mice where contacts were accompanied by 10 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Interestingly, we didnâ€™t find an increase in rectification index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). However, identified a linear correlation between the rectification index and the avoidance index: a higher proportion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at the AIC-LNAc synapses corresponded to a greater degree of avoidance behavior towards the juvenile stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In this study, we characterize a novel top-down circuit between D1 neurons in the AIC and D1 neurons in LNAc, which undergoes forms of social valence-dependent synaptic plasticity. These forms of plasticity serves as the neuronal substrate for learned approach and avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, these forms of plasticity arise from distinct frequency patterns, defining a specific signature for social valence. It is important to note that in this context, valence encompasses more than just the activation or inhibition of a specific neuronal subpopulation and deviates from the traditional definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Our data indicate that valence is determined by the frequency patterns within a specific pathway and the subsequent experience-dependent synaptic changes that drive learned behaviors.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Lorena Jourdain for her assistance with the experimental procedures and Giuseppe Chindemi for his help with data analysis, which unfortunately we could not include in the final version of this publication.
