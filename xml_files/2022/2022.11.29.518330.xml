The underlying pathophysiology of these broader changes is unclear, and it is not known whether they result from ongoing disease processes, treatment-related side-effects, or whether they emerge earlier. Few studies have focused on the period of onset for most focal epilepsies, childhood. Fewer still have utilised quantitative MRI, which may provide a more sensitive and interpretable measure of tissue microstructural change. Here, we aimed to determine common spatial modes of changes in cortical architecture in children with heterogeneous drug-resistant focal epilepsy and, secondarily, whether changes were related to disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">To assess cortical microstructure, quantitative T1 and T2 relaxometry (qT1 and qT2) was measured in 43 children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy [age-range=4-18 years] and 46 typically-developing children [age-range=2-18 years]. We assessed depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 values across the neocortex, as well as their gradient of change across cortical depths. We also determined whether global changes seen in group analyses were driven by focal pathologies in individual patients. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we trained a classifier using qT1 and qT2 gradient maps from patients with radiologically-defined abnormalities (MRI-positive) and healthy controls, and tested if this could classify patients without reported radiological abnormalities (MRI-negative).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">We uncovered depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 increases in widespread cortical areas in patients, likely representing microstructural alterations in myelin or gliosis. Changes did not correlate with disease severity measures, suggesting they may represent antecedent neurobiological alterations. Using a classifier trained with MRI-positive patients and controls, sensitivity was 62% at 100% specificity on held-out MRI-negative patients.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Significance</title><p id="P4">These findings suggest the presence of a potential imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, detectable irrespective of radiologically-identified abnormalities, and potentially evident pre-symptomatically.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Increasing evidence from neuroimaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, neurophysiological <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, neuropathological <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and genetic studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggests that common epilepsies share disturbances in distributed cortico-subcortical brain networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

Such cortical changes may be attributed to the adverse effects of medication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and ongoing and cumulative disease processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it is possible that such alterations represent a predisposing factor to the development of epilepsy. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Most previous MRI studies in epilepsy have assessed structural morphological changes, including volume, surface area, and cortical thickness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Despite providing useful information, morphological markers can reflect the combination of several neuroanatomical features <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques such as longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxometry (qT1 and qT2) are sensitive to tissue structure and biophysical properties at the micrometre scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and allow the in vivo assessment of inconspicuous changes in cortical tissue properties, such as myelin and free-water content <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In adults, previous research has revealed qT1 increases in ipsilateral temporal and frontal limbic cortices in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, with more marked effects in upper cortical levels that taper off towards the white/grey matter (WM/GM) boundary. Increases were particularly marked in patients with early disease onset, suggesting that these alterations may reflect atypical neurodevelopment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Ahmad et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, used qT2 and surface-based analysis techniques to investigate normal-appearing cortical tissue in patients with focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). Widespread cortical qT2 increases in frontal, parietal, and some temporal regions were observed in patients, suggesting effects of the disease in cortical regions beyond the identified focus.</p><p id="P10">There is relatively little neuroimaging research in paediatric epilepsy. Crucially, due to their shorter disease-duration, the assessment of children with epilepsy enables a deeper insight into whether cortical alterations previously reported in adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> may represent antecedent neurobiological alterations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and possibly predisposing factor to disease development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, rather than a secondary effect of the disease.</p><p id="P11">A recent study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> evaluated the distribution of whole-brain qT1 and qT2 changes in a sample of both children and adults with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy with no apparent lesions on conventional MRI. The authors reported multi-regional qT1 increases in patients, in both GM and WM ipsilateral to the epileptic origin, involving key structures of the limbic/paralimbic systems. The detected qT1 increase correlated with younger seizure-onset age, longer epilepsy duration, and higher seizure frequency, suggesting that such changes may be related to seizure burden.</p><p id="P12">In this study, we investigated surface-based qT1 and qT2 values at increasing cortical depths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, as well as their gradient of change as an index of microstructural organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> in a heterogeneous sample of children with focal epilepsy. Assessing a wide range of patients with diverse underlying pathologies allowed us to get a deeper insight into whether biologically distinct focal epilepsy syndromes show robust, common microstructural deficits. As children typically have a shorter disease duration and therefore less opportunity for chronic disease-related cortical damage, we expected to detect focal, rather than global, cortical abnormalities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The relationship of these relaxation parameters to clinical factors including age of onset, disease duration and number of seizures per year was also tested.</p><p id="P13">Further, as an exploratory analysis, we evaluated the potential of qMRI features to act as a biomarker of focal epilepsy, even when there is no radiologically identified focus. For this purpose, we trained a classifier using whole-brain qT1 and qT2 cortical features from MRI-positive patients and healthy controls, and tested if the resulting classifier could identify MRI-negative patients and controls held out from the training phase.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p id="P14">Participants were recruited prospectively, and ethical approval was granted by the Health Research Authority (HRA) and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) (ethics ref 18/LO/1766).

Additionally, at each vertex, qT1 and qT2 values at 20% distance were subtracted from those at 80% distance, providing a gradient of relaxation values across the cortex, here an index of intracortical organisation. Group differences in this gradient were tested. Finally, associations between qT1 and qT2 changes in patients with age of disease onset, disease duration and number of seizures per year were tested. Because of skewness in the data, the number of seizures per year data were log-transformed before assessing correlations. All models were tested by permutation (using the permutation analysis of linear models package, PALM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P26">To understand whether the focal cortical <italic>location</italic> had a significant impact on any observed changes, the above analyses were then repeated by splitting patients with temporal focus (N = 22) and patients with frontal focus (N = 13) into two sub-groups.

Finally, differences in cortical curvature have been shown to systematically affect the laminar and myeloarchitecture of the cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, so that strong correlations between local curvature and R1 (1/T1) can be observed. Therefore, we also controlled for individual differences in vertex-wise cortical curvature. To address the multiple comparisons problem, family-wise error correction rate was applied across MRI modalities (i.e. qT1 and qT2) and statistical contrasts using the “-corrmod” and “-corrcon options” in PALM.

In this work, we assessed whole brain cortical changes in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p><p id="P42">Focussing exclusively on childhood enabled us to gain a deeper insight into whether cortical alterations are the result of ongoing chronic disease-processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and treatment-related side-effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, or whether they emerge at an earlier disease-stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The marked heterogeneity in the sample in terms of lesion/focus location and underlying pathologies could be leveraged to further understand shared patterns of abnormalities. The use of a multiparametric qMRI approach allowed to move beyond morphological markers to probe changes in cortical tissue microstructure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P43">Overall, our findings indicate the presence of consistent, widespread, depth-mediated qT1 and qT2 increases in children with focal epilepsy. Additionally, they reveal significant alterations in patients’ intracortical organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, demonstrated by a radial gradient of increased qT1 and qT2 values driven from the WM/GM border in patients. Consistent with previous evidence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, the observed cortical changes were robust to potential confounders, including age-at-scan and brain morphology, suggesting that they represent a different underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Moreover, the detected alterations did not appear specific to, or driven by, the focal cortical lesions of patients, as demonstrated by the fact that qT1 and qT2 values within the investigated FCDs did not significantly deviate from control values in the same area. Importantly, in accord with previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, clinical parameters did not correlate with qT1 and qT2 times across the cortex, implying that such microstructural alterations may be independent of ongoing disease processes.</p><p id="P44">Notably, our findings indicate that microstructural alterations in focal epilepsy are independent of seizure onset or focus laterality. Though stronger changes were detected in the temporal lobe of TLE patients, alterations still extended to the wider cortex. Such widespread effects were particularly evident when looking at qT1 and qT2 gradients. While no alterations were detected in the sub-group of patients with frontal focus, this is most likely because of the smaller size of this subgroup. Additionally, while qT1 increases at the different depths predominantly affected patients’ ipsilateral hemisphere, we detected bilateral effects on the qT1 gradient over cortical depths. Finally, extensive qT2 increases were uncovered in patients across cortical depths and when looking at the gradient of change. Our findings are in accord with previous work demonstrating the presence of morphological alterations following a bilateral pattern and extent that is independent of the side of seizure focus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and not specific to the patients’ focal pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P45">Importantly, we demonstrate that these widespread cortical features are sufficiently consistent across all children with epilepsy that they can act as classification features. A simple random forest classifier trained on whole-brain qT1 and qT2 surface maps from MRI-positive patients and controls could classify epilepsy status in MRI-<italic>negative</italic> patients and controls not used in the training phase. Likewise, the same classifier trained on whole-brain qT1 and qT2 surface maps from MRI-negative patients and controls could classify epilepsy status in MRI-<italic>positive</italic> patients and controls not used in the training phase. These findings suggest that there may be an imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, common in MRI-positive and MRI-negative cases.</p><p id="P46">There are several underlying microstructural changes that could explain the cortical qT1 and qT2 alterations observed in patients in this study. For qT1, previous evidence suggests that this measure may be sensitive to GM myelin content <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, increased qT1 values and alterations in qT1 gradients may potentially reflect the presence of cortical myelin disturbance in paediatric focal epilepsy, mirroring pathology findings in TLE where surgical specimens had alterations in intracortical myelination and fiber arrangement, particularly in upper cortical layers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P47">On the other hand, the qT2 depth-wise and gradient increases observed in this study might be related to gliosis. Previous evidence has reported a correlation between gliosis and hippocampal subfields qT2 in TLE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, though this is not yet reported in cortical epilepsy. Therefore, gliosis on a microstructural level may reflect a remodelling process which might explain the observed qT2 increases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Alternatively, since qT2 is dependent on the free water content in tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, tissue damage and replacement of cells in nervous tissue by water could potentially be another mechanism leading to the increased cortical qT2 observed in patients.</p><p id="P48">From an aetiological point of view, ongoing seizure-activity could underly qT1 and qT2 alterations observed in this study. Accordingly, Su and colleagues (2023) reported limbic/paralimbic qT1 increases in children and adults with focal epilepsy which correlated with younger seizure-onset age, longer epilepsy duration, and higher seizure frequency, suggesting again that such changes may be related to seizure burden <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">However, other previous investigations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> failed to detect a significant relationship between structural parameters and clinical seizure occurrence, and reported the lack of an association between anticonvulsive drugs and qT2 variation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Crucially, the ability of our classifier to classify young patients, as well as the lack of association between qT1 and qT2 changes and disease duration or age of onset demonstrated in this study, lend support to the suggestion that alterations may be independent of disease progression and instead might constitute antecedent microstructural alterations reflecting developmental cortical changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P50">Further supporting the hypothesis that qT1 and qT2 abnormalities reflect precursor anomalies in brain development, a longitudinal study of children with new-onset focal and idiopathic generalized epilepsy demonstrated differences in baseline GM and WM volumes of focal patients compared to controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Further, Widjaja and colleagues reported changes in cortical thickness in the right medial temporal, cingulate, and left frontal cortices in children with new-onset seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">It is possible that such early brain changes may predispose patients to seizures, but this remains a challenging hypothesis to test in focal epilepsy compared to family designs possible in genetic epilepsies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Future relaxometry studies assessing paediatric patients with new-onset seizures longitudinally will enable to better disentangle the impact of age from the effect of disease, as well as of recurrent seizures and long-term antiepileptic medications on the brain. Additionally, the specificity of these global cortical changes to focal epilepsy as opposed to seizures is unclear and inclusion of other epilepsies is needed.</p><p id="P52">Future studies could also assess subtle variations in cortical iron depositions and myelination, thus providing rich complementary information to the existing evidence. Additionally, the integration of multimodal MRI with macroscale diffusion-based connectivity changes promises to better understand both the local- and network-level substrates of drug-resistant focal epilepsies.</p><p id="P53">Most importantly, analysis approaches that address patients heterogeneity, such as normative modelling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, will allow to control for brain variability and rapid, non-linear tissue changes associated with development, and therefore to better disentangle significant pathologic changes from ‘normal’ or expected age-related alterations.</p></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P54">To conclude, we demonstrate widespread, depth-mediated qT1 and qT2 increases in the cortex of children with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy. Though the aetiology of these cortical alterations is not fully understood, it is possible that such microstructural changes appear during cerebral development and represent precedent neurobiological alterations, rather than the cumulative effect of recurrent seizures or the consequence of medications’ side-effects. Accordingly, based on our findings it is plausible to suggest that global cortical changes in surface-based qT1 and qT2 may constitute a potential imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, detectable with or without the presence of radiologically identified abnormalities and disease-onset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157870-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157870-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d82aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the families who generously supported this study.

structural pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Then, surface extraction was performed at a series of cortical depths and qT1 and qT2 maps were projected onto each depth. This allowed the assessment of group differences in: (1) qT1 and qT2 values at several depths from the pial surface; (2) qT1 and qT2 gradient of variation across cortical depths. Associations with disease duration and number of seizures per year were also explored. We also computed surface-based qMRI profiles of FCD lesions (3), and assessed whether cortical microstructure patterns learnt from MRI-positive patients could classify MRI-negative patients (4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157870-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Workflow of the computation of surface-based qMRI profiles of FCD lesions.</title><p>Lesion masks were delineated on the FLAIR images of each of the 5 patients with FCDs. The lesion masks were then mapped to each cortical depth in patients and controls in standard surface space. The mean and standard deviation of qT1 and qT2 were extracted within the masks, after removing the effect of age and sex using linear regression. This allowed computation of the z-score profile of each patient normed against the controls, corrected for age and sex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157870-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Group differences between patients and healthy controls in qT1 and qT2 at each cortical depth:</bold> When comparing all patients against controls, qT1 increases were detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 60 and 80% depth in patients, while bilateral increases were detected in qT2 at 60 and 80% depth.
