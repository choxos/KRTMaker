Here we report an unexpected, and mechanistically distinct, nuclear function of iRhoms. iRhom2 is a non-canonical substrate of the signal peptidase complex (SPC), the protease that removes signal peptides from secreted proteins. Cleavage of iRhom2 generates an N-terminal fragment that enters the nucleus and modifies the cellular transcriptome. We observed elevated nuclear iRhom2 in skin biopsies of patients with psoriasis and tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC); increased SPC-mediated iRhom2 cleavage in a psoriasis model; and overlapping transcriptional signatures between psoriasis and expression of the iRhom2 N-terminus. This work highlights the pathophysiological significance of this SPC-dependent ER-to-nucleus signalling pathway, and is the first example of a rhomboid-like protein that mediates protease-regulated nuclear signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rhomboid</kwd><kwd>RHBDF2</kwd><kwd>RHBDF1</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>TOC</kwd><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The rhomboid-like superfamily of membrane proteins comprises the originally-discovered rhomboid intramembrane serine proteases, and multiple pseudoproteases which, despite being widely conserved, have lost their protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Freeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lemberg and Adrain, 2016</xref>). Pseudoenzymes were once assumed to be functionally dead evolutionary remnants, but they are emerging as an important class of proteins with significant biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain and Freeman, 2012</xref>), and this is consistent with what is known of the diverse functions of pseudoprotease members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, the best characterised of which are iRhom1 and iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dulloo et al., 2019</xref>). They are now most famous as regulatory cofactors of ADAM17, a cell surface metalloprotease responsible for the release of important intercellular signalling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Zunke and Rose-John, 2017</xref>). As such, iRhoms control both inflammatory signalling by the cytokine TNF, and growth factor signalling by members of the EGF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>). iRhoms are, however, multifunctional and they also participate in, for example, the response to chronic ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dulloo et al., 2022</xref>) and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Luo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Rhomboid-like proteins have a modular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dulloo et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanistic theme believed to underlie all their functions is the specific recognition of, and interaction with, transmembrane domains (TMDs) of substrates and client proteins. This TMD recognition function is mediated by their conserved transmembrane core. All rhomboid-like proteins also have cytoplasmic and luminal/extracellular domains, which are less well conserved, and are presumed to mediate functions more specific to particular members of the superfamily. In the case of the iRhoms, these include a long cytoplasmic N-terminus, and a large luminal loop between TMD1 and TMD2, called the iRhom homology domain (IRHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>). The cytoplasmic N-terminus is predicted to be largely unstructured but has important regulatory properties, interacts with several accessory factors and signalling proteins, as well as being the site of post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Oikonomidi et al., 2018</xref>) and disease-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blaydon et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We and others have previously noted that C-terminally tagged iRhoms exist in two forms: the full-length protein, and a shorter fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>) whose size suggests that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is deleted. Indeed, the N-terminal domain may not be essential for some iRhom functions: its deletion is reported not to abolish function but instead to cause elevated constitutive ADAM17 activity in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Maney et al., 2015</xref>) and, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a wing phenotype that suggests hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, whether shorter forms of iRhoms have any physiological function remains unexplored.</p><p id="P6">Pursuing this question, we have discovered that endogenous iRhom2 undergoes partial proteolytic cleavage to generate three stable forms: the full-length protein, and both N- and C-terminal fragments. We have identified the protease responsible for this iRhom2 cleavage as the signal peptidase complex (SPC). SPC is primarily the protease responsible for the removal of signal peptides from proteins entering the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jackson and Blobel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liaci et al., 2021</xref>), but in this case cleaves iRhom2 non-canonically, adjacent to its first transmembrane domain (TMD). The consequence of SPC cleavage is the release of the N-terminal domain of iRhom2 and its translocation to the nucleus, where it modifies the cellular transcriptome. Strikingly, the pathophysiological significance of this newly uncovered ER-to-nucleus pathway is indicated by our observation that skin biopsies particularly from patients with psoriasis or the genetic syndrome tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC) show elevated nuclear iRhom2. There is also significant overlap between genes differentially expressed in lesional psoriatic skin and those upregulated by nuclear iRhom2, accompanied by higher expression levels of iRhom2 and several components of the SPC. Overall, this work expands our understanding of the spectrum of functions of both rhomboid-like proteins and SPC.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A cleaved N-terminal fragment of iRhom2 translocates to the nucleus</title><p id="P7">A HEK293T cell line in which endogenous iRhom2 was C-terminally tagged with a 3XHA tag by CRISPR knock-in confirmed previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunzel et al., 2018</xref>) that endogenous iRhom2 exists as both full-length and a shorter C-terminal forms. The identity of both bands as iRhom2 was validated with two different siRNAs against iRhom2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of C-terminally 3XHA-tagged iRhom1 and iRhom2 led to the generation of both full-length protein (± 100 KDa; iR1/2-FL), and a shorter C-terminal form of approximately 50 kDa (iR1/2-CT) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, top panel). Using an antibody specific to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, bottom panel), we detected a N-terminal form of iRhom2 of approximately 45 kDa (iR2-NT). The endogenous existence of this N-terminal fragment was confirmed in wild-type but not iRhom2 knockout mouse lung tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We conclude that iRhoms exist in three major forms – the full-length protein, and N- and C-terminal fragments, whose combined sizes suggest that they are products of proteolytic cleavage.</p><p id="P8">Treatment of cells overexpressing iRhom2 with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) or the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine and 3-MA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>) did not prevent the generation of the shorter C-terminal iRhom2 fragment, suggesting that the fragments were not products of protein degradation. We also asked whether the N- and C-terminal forms of iRhom2 were stable in cells. Cycloheximide chase experiments showed that the cleaved iRhom2 protein had a half-life &gt;4hrs, while the full-length protein half-life was approximately 2hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1d-e</xref>). These data confirm that iRhoms proteins exist in multiple stable forms, apparently due to the proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein into an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment.</p><p id="P9">Full-length iRhom2 is a polytopic membrane protein with two known major cellular locations: the ER and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dulloo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Oikonomidi et al., 2018</xref>). N-linked glycans attached to ER proteins are sensitive to the deglycosidase Endo H, while the glycans on post-Golgi proteins are insensitive to Endo H but can be removed by PNGase F. In cells expressing C-terminally tagged iRhoms, Endo H treatment caused a downshift of both the full-length and the C-terminal iRhom2 fragment, indicating that the C-terminal iRhom2 fragment is predominantly localised in the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with this, in immunofluorescent staining, the full-length (GFP- and HA tagged) and C-terminal iRhom2 fragment (HA tagged) colocalised with the ER resident protein BAP31, clearly visible in the ER and the nuclear envelope (which is contiguous with the ER) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To our surprise, however, the N-terminal fragment (iR2-NT), labelled with the GFP tag, also showed weak but reproducible diffuse staining in the nucleus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). A different iRhom2 construct, tagged with HA at the N-terminal, showed similar nuclear localisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). These data raised the possibility that after cleavage, iR2-NT (but not iR2-CT) translocates to the nucleus.</p><p id="P10">To explore the characteristics of iRhom2 cleavage, we assessed the size of iR2-NT by expressing different deletion mutants of 2XHA tagged N-terminal domain. The N-terminal iRhom2 cleavage fragment was sized closest to iR2-1-403, which included predicted TMD1 and a few luminal amino acids (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), indicating that the cleavage occurs around the luminal border of TMD1, which would generate a fragment that remains membrane tethered. The nuclear localisation of the N-terminal domain was confirmed with immunofluorescent staining: iR2-1-374 and iR2-1-382, both of which lack full TMD1, were solely nuclear (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast, iR2-1-392 and iR2-1-403, both containing TMD1, showed both soluble nuclear and ER staining, including in the nuclear envelope; iR2-1-403 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and the naturally cleaved iR2-NT fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>) both colocalised with the nuclear envelope marker SUN2.</p><p id="P11">Consistent with our experimental observations, we identified two conserved potential nuclear localisation signal (NLS) motifs in the iRhom2 N-terminus – one monopartite and one bipartite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). The traffic of membrane proteins with bulky cytoplasmic domains to the nuclear envelope is dependent on the presence of disordered regions and an NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Meinema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mudumbi et al., 2020</xref>); in accordance with this, deletion of both NLS motifs from iR2-1-403 markedly reduced soluble nuclear staining (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Overall, these results lead us to conclude that proteolytic release of the iRhom2 N-terminal domain from the full-length ER-localised protein leads to its nuclear translocation. Note that the iR2-NT fragment contains TMD1 and thereby remains membrane tethered. Despite this, the diffuse nucleoplasmic staining of iR2-NT cleaved from full-length iRhom2 and the TMD-containing constructs iR2-1-392 and iR2-1-403 implies the existence of a secondary cleavage event that ultimately releases a soluble nuclear iRhom2 fragment into the nucleoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>iRhom2 is cleaved at the luminal juxtamembrane region of TMD1</title><p id="P13">The primary site of iRhom2 cleavage is predicted to be near the luminal end of TMD1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), the boundaries of which were further defined based on secondary structure and TMD prediction analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Sequence alignment of iRhom1 and iRhom2 from mouse and human showed a highly conserved stretch of 8 amino acid residues (YGIAPVGF) in this region (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Mutation to leucine of all (L8), or only the last 4 (L4), of these 8 amino acids abolished cleavage of iRhom2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), as did the mutation of PVGF to LVLF. In contrast, mutation of PV to AI only partially inhibited cleavage (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). We conclude that the PVGF motif is required for iRhom2 cleavage. Significantly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom does not contain the PVGF motif (PVGF being replaced by PIGI; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and, consistent with the importance of the motif, we detected no cleavage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, mutation of the PVGF in iRhom2 to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequence PIGI abrogated cleavage (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The converse experiment, mutating <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom from PIGI to the mammalian sequence PVGF, caused <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom to be cleaved (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Overall, these data confirm that the widely conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) PVGF motif in the luminal juxtamembrane region adjacent to TMD1 determines the cleavage of iRhom proteins.</p><p id="P14">We assessed whether uncleavable iRhom2 mutants can fulfil two well characterised functions: the destabilisation of EGF-like ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>), and the maturation of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>). All uncleavable mutants were able to downregulate EGF protein levels indistinguishably from wild-type iRhom2, implying that these iRhom2 mutants are functional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). ADAM17 maturation was also unaffected by the uncleavable mutant PVGF-&gt;PIGI, implying that this process, too, was not dependent on iRhom2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). ADAM17 maturation was, however, inhibited by the other uncleavable iRhom2 mutants (AI, L4, L8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). This apparently contradictory result is explained by co-immunoprecipitation assays, which show that those iRhom2 mutants defective in ADAM17 processing had markedly reduced binding between iRhom2 and ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), whereas the PVGF-&gt;PIGI mutation binds normally. Overall, these results indicate that neither EGF degradation nor ADAM17 maturation depend on iRhom2 cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Signal peptidase complex cleaves iRhom2</title><p id="P15">We sought to identify the protease responsible for primary iRhom2 cleavage. Structural prediction by AlphaFold agreed with TMD predictions that the PVGF motif is located within the ER lumen, immediately adjacent to TMD1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Treatment with broad spectrum protease inhibitors against each of the four main categories of proteases (serine, cysteine, aspartic acid, and metallo-) did not significantly inhibit cleavage of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). One possibility we checked was RHBDL4, a rhomboid protease, located in the ER, and capable of cleaving within the luminal domains of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Paschkowsky et al., 2016</xref>), but its knockdown had no effect on iRhom2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We have previously reported an iRhom2 interaction screen, in which one of the top hits was SEC11C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunzel et al., 2018</xref>), one of the two catalytic subunits of eukaryotic signal peptidase complex (SPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liaci et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Shelness and Blobel, 1990</xref>). Although SPC has a well-established function in removing canonical signal peptides from proteins entering the ER, it also catalyses the cleavage of multiple other signal peptide-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hegde and Bernstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Owji et al., 2018</xref>). Knockdown of SEC11C alone did not have any significant effect on cleavage of endogenous iRhom2 in HEK293T cells but silencing the alternative SPC catalytic subunit, SEC11A, had a slight effect (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Most strikingly, the combined knockdown of SEC11A and SEC11C abolished cleavage of endogenous (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) or overexpressed iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Additionally, treatment of cells with cavinafungin, an inhibitor of SPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Estoppey et al., 2017</xref>), blocked the cleavage of iRhom2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In further support of the role of SPC, knockdown of any of the three essential accessory subunits (SPCS1, SPCS2, SPCS3) also blocked iRhom2 cleavage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>); note that knockdown of one subunit of SPC leads to depletion of the others, a phenomenon often seen in multi-subunit protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pla-Prats and Thoma, 2022</xref>). In contrast, none of these treatments altered the expression of ER chaperones GRP78 or GRP94, indicating that SPC knockdown was not causing more general defects in ER homeostasis. Consistent with iRhom2 being a substrate of SPC, two signal peptide prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>) identified a potential SPC cleavage site in iRhom2, at the sequence PVGFA|QH, which matches the region we have experimentally determined to be required for cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). As a negative control of this prediction, no cleavage sites were predicted around TMD1 of DERLIN1, another ER-localised rhomboid-like pseudoprotease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). Finally, the SEC11A catalytic subunit coimmunoprecipitated with both wild-type iRhom2 and the uncleavable LVLF mutant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Deletion of TMD2-&gt;7 of iRhom2 (iR2_TMD1_IRHD) but not the luminal IRHD (iR2_DIRHD) showed this interaction was dependent on the TMD domains of iRhom2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Since our data imply a secondary cleavage, to release the membrane tethered product of iRhom2 cleavage by SPC into the nucleoplasm (see above), we asked whether the intramembrane protease signal peptide peptidase (SPP) might be a responsible for the second cleavage. SPP cuts a number of released signal peptides after canonical SPC processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Weihofen et al., 2002</xref>), although this appears not to be universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mentrup et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of SPP with (Z-LL)<sub>2</sub> ketone had no effect on nuclear staining of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>), indicating that SPP is not responsible for the formation of soluble iR2-NT.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nuclear iRhom2 modifies the cellular transcriptome</title><p id="P18">To ask whether the nuclear iRhom2 fragment has biological activity, we characterised the consequences of expressing the nuclear iR2-1-374 fragment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). We generated HEK293T cells stably expressing HA-tagged iR2-1-374, and biochemical fractionation experiments detected iR2-1-374 in both soluble (S4) and insoluble, chromatin containing (P4) nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The soluble (S4) fraction was increased by MNASE-mediated DNA digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), similar to control Histone H3 protein, indicating that nuclear iRhom2 associates with chromatin. We also generated HEK293T cells stably expressing HA-tagged iR2-1-374 under a tetracycline inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), and observed that iR2-1-374 co-immunoprecipitated with the B1 subunit of RNA Polymerase II (POL2), and transcription factor IID (TFIID) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), both integral components of the eukaryotic gene transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Roeder, 2019</xref>). To test the implication that nuclear iR2-1-374 might therefore influence gene expression, using RNA-seq, we examined the cellular transcriptome at 3h and 6h after induction. The expression of 1233 and 1280 genes were significantly changed (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) at 3h and 6h respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).

Although the biological role of rhomboid-like proteins is varied, a common functional theme has been their specific recognition of TMDs in substrates and clients. In this work, we have uncovered an iRhom-mediated signalling pathway, unrelated to this core function of membrane protein regulation. It is mediated by the proteolytic release of the iRhom N-terminal domain, which then translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression. By this mechanism, iRhoms now join a select group of membrane proteins with a secondary nuclear function triggered by proteolytic release of intracellular domains. The best-known examples include Notch, SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein), and the ATF6 branch of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sakai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). Cytoplasmic domains of each of these proteins are released from cellular membranes, to translocate to the nucleus where they trigger a transcriptional response.</p><p id="P28">In each of those previously discovered examples, targets are cleaved by an intramembrane protease, which cuts its substrate TMD in a position that generates a fragment with too short a hydrophobic helix to be retained in the membrane. In the case of SPC cleavage of iRhom2, which we believe to be the first report of a mammalian membrane tethered protein being converted to a nuclear signal by SPC, there must be a secondary cleavage to release the cleaved N-terminal domain from its membrane anchoring TMD. Indeed, we see that iRhom2 in the nucleus exists in two distinct sub-locations: membrane tethered in the nuclear envelope, and diffusely located in the nucleoplasm. As expected, when the N-terminal domain with no TMD is expressed, it is solely located in the nucleoplasm. We do not know the identity of the protease responsible for the secondary cleavage, reflecting wider uncertainty about the fate of canonical signal peptides cleaved by SPC. Some are degraded by the intramembrane aspartyl protease, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), which was originally named to reflect the view that it was the protease that degrades all signal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Weihofen et al., 2002</xref>). More recently, however, it has become much less clear that SPP has a general role, and the fate of most signal peptides after SPC cleavage remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mentrup et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of iRhom2, we have experimentally ruled out SPP as the secondary protease that releases the soluble form of the N-terminus.</p><p id="P29">Signal peptidase complex is primarily responsible for the removal of signal peptides from proteins entering the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jackson and Blobel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liaci et al., 2021</xref>). Signal peptides are typically 15-30 amino acids long, and reside in the first 30 amino acids of the coding sequence. Despite being in a TMD nearly 400 amino acids from the N-terminus of the protein, the SPC cleavage site of iRhom2 broadly resembles the normal determinants of signal peptide cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">von Heijne, 1983, 1984</xref>): two positively charged conserved amino acids (H and R) (the n-region), immediately preceding TMD1 (the h-region), followed by uncharged conserved amino acid segment (YGIAPVGF) (the c-region). At the predicted cleavage site of iRhom2 (PVGFA|Q), residues at positions -1 and -3 are Ala and Gly respectively and, together with a Gln residue at the +1 position, these align with the consensus amino acids observed in eukaryotic signal peptidase cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Choo and Ranganathan, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, the iRhom2 cleavage site is recognised by signal peptide identification algorithms (as long as they do not incorporate a penalty for distance from the N-terminus). Interestingly, the SPC substrate-determining amino acids are well conserved in iRhoms across many species, although a few (chicken, some fish) have variations that might impair cleavage. In contrast, they are absent in the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom. Consistent with this prediction, we have shown <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom to be uncleaved (and uncleavable) by SPC, unless the relevant amino acids are mutated to the human sequence. Other non-canonical cleavage of TMDs by SPC has been previously reported. For example, SPC removes 83 residues from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell surface protein Crumbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kilic et al., 2010</xref>), 37 residues from the human cytomegalovirus protein UL40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Ulbrecht et al., 2000</xref>), and 135 residues from the canine distemper virus fusion glycoprotein F0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">von Messling and Cattaneo, 2002</xref>). To our knowledge, the N-terminal domain of iRhom2 is the longest N-terminal fragment from a mammalian protein to be reported as cleaved by SPC.</p><p id="P30">It is essential that iRhoms are only partially cleaved by SPC, because other iRhom functions, like ADAM17 activation and response to ER stress, require full-length iRhom2. The mechanistic basis for this partial SPC cleavage of iRhom2, and how it is regulated, remains unknown but it is notable that the timing and efficiency of signal sequence cleavage does vary for different SPC substrates. In the case of the HIV-1 gp160 envelope protein, for example, slow and inefficient signal sequence cleavage provides a checkpoint mechanism to ensure full folding and maturation has occurred prior to onward trafficking from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Snapp et al., 2017</xref>). The flaviviridae family also take advantage of slow processing by endogenous SPC, to ensure a correct sequence of cleavages of the viral polyprotein – necessary for efficient virus particle assembly and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alzahrani et al., 2020</xref>). In both these cases, the cause of inefficient or slow processing has been mapped to non-canonical sequences in the SPC recognition sequence, so it will be interesting in the future to explore more widely the regulation and precise determinants of iRhom cleavage by SPC.</p><p id="P31">The regulation of the cellular transcriptome by nuclear iRhom2 is likely to be indirect as it does not have any discernible features of a typical transcription factor (e.g., transactivation or DNA-binding domains). Indeed, our observations that nuclear iRhom2 can bind to chromatin, and interact with RNA Polymerase II and TFIID, components of the eukaryotic transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Roeder, 2019</xref>), indicate that its regulation of gene expression is likely as part of a transcription activator or repressor complex. It would seem most likely that the soluble form of nuclear iRhom2-NT is responsible for its transcriptional regulatory function, but we note that it is also possible that the membrane tethered nuclear iRhom2-NT could play a more direct role in effecting gene expression changes. Nuclear envelope tethered proteins mostly act through interaction with chromatin associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Czapiewski et al., 2016</xref>), LAP2b and MAN1 can bind directly to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Caputo et al., 2006</xref>). MAN1 can also act as a transcription scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pan et al., 2005</xref>), sequestering R-Smads, crucial regulators of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and activin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Massague et al., 2005</xref>). Note, however, that despite this molecular question of the relative significance of membrane tethered and nucleoplasmic iRhom2-NT, the transcriptional effects of iRhom2 are strictly SPC-dependent.</p><p id="P32">Dominant iRhom2 mutations are the cause of the inherited syndrome tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), which is characterised by palmoplantar keratoderma, oral precursor lesions, and a high lifetime risk of oesophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blaydon et al., 2012</xref>). iRhom2<sup>TOC</sup> mutants show upregulated shedding of EGF ligands by ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brooke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), which is proposed to contribute to disease pathology. Our discovery of a parallel nuclear function of the iRhom2 N-terminal domain, indicates that iRhom2-dependent changes to gene expression may also contribute to pathogenesis. Consistent with this idea, we show nuclear localisation of iRhom2 in normal human skin, which is significantly elevated in TOC and lesional psoriatic skin, indicating a possible association between levels of nuclear iRhom2 and disease. Although this potential pathogenic mechanism needs further exploration, it is striking that both TOC and psoriasis exhibit epidermal keratinocyte hyperplasia, and that epidermal thickness has been associated with iRhom2 expression in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blaydon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hosur et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hosur et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Maruthappu et al., 2017</xref>). It is also notable that both iRhom2 and SPC subunits are upregulated in psoriasis in our analysis of a published RNA-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tsoi et al., 2019</xref>). The relevance of iRhom2 to the pathogenesis of psoriasis is also consistent with the overlap of genes differentially regulated by nuclear iRhom2, and those in lesional psoriasis. Notably, GO analysis indicates that one of the main biological processes predicted to be affected in both data sets is the cell cycle. Psoriatic skin lesions develop following increased mitosis of keratinocytes, leading to incomplete cornification and a poorly adherent stratum corneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Griffiths and Barker, 2007</xref>). Several studies also noted that the mitotic cell cycle was among the most significant process differentially regulated between normal and lesional psoriasis skin tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pasquali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tsoi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, we want to emphasise that there is much to learn about the role of iRhom2 in skin pathologies. For example, as well as increased cell division, psoriasis is also characterised by acute infiltration of inflammatory immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells, which induce the release of chemokines and cytokines, including TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nestle et al., 2009</xref>). iRhom2 is highly expressed in immune cells and, through its central role in ADAM17 activation, controls TNF secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Al-Salihi and Lang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, therefore, it seems likely that the pathogenesis of skin disease associated with iRhom2 may combine aspects of both inflammatory signalling and nuclear functions.</p><p id="P33">Finally, iRhoms represent an interesting example of the still rather poorly explored phenomenon of pseudoenzymes and their potential biological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain and Freeman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, they are pseudoproteases, having lost through evolution the proteolytic activity of their more ancient cousins, the rhomboid intramembrane serine proteases. Until now, all known iRhom function has been apparently related to the proposed core function of members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, namely the specific recognition of TMDs and regulation of transmembrane proteins. Not only does this work expand our specific understanding of iRhom function, and illustrate the modular nature of rhomboid-like proteins, it also highlights how evolution can build completely new functions into pseudoenzymes, increasing functional divergence from their ancestral enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S10"><title>Molecular cloning and plasmids</title><p id="P34">Wild-type iRhom1, iRhom2 and mutants iRhom2_DIRHD and iRhom2_TMD1-IRHD plasmids in pEGFP-N1 vector with a C-terminal 3XHA tag have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dulloo et al., 2022</xref>).
