In this system, the cuticle develops two distinct subdomains, (i) an uppermost layer which increases in thickness and in-plane extension and (ii) a substrate. We quantify the pattern formation and geometrical changes and then postulate a mechanical model assuming that the cuticle behaves as a growing bi-layer. The model is a quasi-static morpho-elastic system and it is numerically investigated in two and three dimensional settings, using different laws of film and substrate expansion and boundary conditions. We recreate several features of the observed developmental trajectories in petals. We establish the respective roles of the layers’ stiffness mismatch, the underlying cell-wall curvature, the cell in-plane expansion and the thickness growth rates of the layers in determining the observed pattern features, such as the variance observed in amplitude and wavelength. Our observations provide evidence which justify the growing bi-layer description, and provide valuable insights into why some systems develop surface patterns and others do not.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The variety of topographic patterns found on the surface of plant petal and leaf epidermal cells has attracted the attention of researchers from disciplines ranging from developmental biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] to material sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. These patterns have been shown to mediate several forms of interaction with the environment. For instance, it has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] that patterned petals can act as optical and tactile cues for pollinators, providing some flowers with structural colour, and may also contribute to altered flower-pollinator adhesion or regulate hydrophobicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P3">A striking example of pattern functionality is provided by the model system <italic>Hibiscus trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) in which the pattern consists of quasi-periodic nano ridges acting as a light diffracting grating array, conferring structural colour to the flower. The pattern forms on one of the two sub-domains of the petal’s adaxial surface which are defined by their epidermal cell shapes and which roughly coincide with the white and pigmented domains. The white domain consists of conical shaped cells that do not develop surface pattern. The rest of the petal is composed of cells with an elongated in-plane rectangular shape located mostly in the purple pigmented region of the tissue and where the cell surface develops a distinctive striated pattern.</p><p id="P4">The striated pattern aligns parallel to the major axis of the cells and forms on the cuticle, which is the outermost layer of the epidermis. Plant cuticles are extracellular polymer layers that act as a physical defence against a number of environmental agents. They comprise two chemically distinguishable sub-layers: a base layer that starts at the cell wall, which we refer to as the “cuticular substrate”, and an upper surface-most layer or “cuticle film” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Such bi-layered structures play a significant role in systems that develop periodic surface deformations, as a result of a compression induced elastic instability. In the case of <italic>Hibiscus trionum</italic>, it has been shown that the cuticle behaves like a bi-layer composite, as the patterns can be induced by uniaxial stretching of the cuticles before the pattern occurs naturally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The striated domain generates an iridescent reflectance spectrum which as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] is also different from that of a perfectly flat periodic grating and has served as inspiration in the design of new materials.</p><p id="P5">The origin of the surface deformation has been hypothesised to be mechanical in nature. Specifically, it may be due to a mechanical instability associated with cuticle overproduction. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] the authors assume the cuticle to be a homogeneous incompressible, mechanically isotropic layer, and propose that cuticle production is described by an adjustable parameter, which turns the in-plane stress components into tensile or compressive as the cuticle is anisotropically stretched due to cellular in-plane growth. This purely elastic formulation, however, does not address issues such as the existence of buckled configurations associated with the stress tensors proposed, the irreversible nature of the patterns or the critical nature of the elastic instability i.e., the existence of in-plane stress threshold values which need to be exceeded for the material to buckle. Nor does it provide any understanding of pattern features such as the amplitude or wavelength of striations and their relation to the material properties of the cuticle. A more comprehensive description of the mechanics behind patterned cuticles in petals is given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] by considering the cuticle as a bi-layered composite described by linear stress-strain constitutive relations and linking stress to in-plane cell and petal shape geometrical changes, which then determine the pattern orientation but without explicitly addressing the developmental aspects we discuss here.</p><p id="P6">A bilayer composite develops a surface periodic pattern or wrinkling/buckling instability in the upper surface if an applied in-plane stress in a given direction exceeds a threshold value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The resulting pattern is oriented in the perpendicular direction to the applied in-plane stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The critical threshold and pattern features depend on the elastic properties of the composite, its geometry and boundary conditions. For rectangular flat volumes, these dependencies are fairly general, regardless of the material model specifics, provided the elastic responses are isotropic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and are given by the scaling rules at the onset of the instability, namely, the wavelength: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula> and the critical strain: <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P7">Where <italic>h</italic> is the film thickness, <italic>R</italic> the ratio of the elastic response modulus of the film and substrate and <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>γ</italic><sub>2</sub> are constants. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eqn 1</xref> states that a thicker upper film induces a larger wavelength, whereas <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eqn. 2</xref> means that larger elastic mismatch between the film/substrate stiffness result in lower buckling thresholds. As described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], these patterns emerge as trade-off states between the energetically favourable states of the slender film and the substrate under the same stress.</p><p id="P8">The universality of the buckling mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] means that the trends in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eqn. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eqn. 2</xref> are followed by a large class of material models, regardless of the origin of the in-plane stress. For instance, periodic buckling patterns can be achieved by several settings involving uni-axial compression or unidirectional in-plane growth of the layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. If in-plane stress acts on more than one direction, the possible instabilities which can be triggered range from checkerboards and hexagonal arrays to herringbones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P9">In this work, we present results of a detailed developmental analysis of the cell geometry and pattern features in the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>trionum</italic> petal, which are then used to formulate morpho-mechanical models of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. As discussed below, this results in configurations of an irreversible nature and with deformations which are beyond the linear theory. Investigation of the models allowed us to elucidate the interplay of cuticle production, cell elongation and cell bulging in shaping the pattern and also permit us to pinpoint the locations where the pattern is triggered. Specifically, we explore the effects that different growth rates have on both reaching the buckling threshold and on the pattern features. Our results explain why some plant cuticles form surface patterns whereas others do not and clarify how this is related to cuticle synthesis and cuticle structural and mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].

As we show next, quantitative measurements of changes of the cell geometry support the case for in-plane compressive stress induced by a larger expansion of the cuticle film in comparison to that of the substrate and underlying cells, in the direction orthogonal to the pattern ridges, to be the mechanism responsible for the origin of the buckling instability in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>trionum</italic>.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Description of Hibiscus flower epidermis and its development</title><p id="P11">In <italic>Hibiscus trionum</italic> the pattern occurs in the uppermost layer on the external face of the epidermal cells, i.e. in the plant cuticle.

From the start of pattern formation until the flower opens, cell elongation is the main expansion mechanism responsible for the petal surface growth. The in-plane cell expansion and the cuticle thickening indicate that the volume of the cuticle layer is increasing, if such expansion is isotropic, then the cell expansion of the cells in a preferential (length) direction will induce an excess of cuticle in the perpendicular direction (width) effectively compressing the cuticle in that direction.</p><p id="P14"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> shows several cross sections taken at the onset of pattern appearance. The pattern starts populating flatter sub-domains of the tissue such as the regions located on top of cell junctions, whereas for regions with larger curvature, pattern initiation is delayed by the bulging of the cell wall due to turgor pressure. This external domain deformation also contributes to a stress distribution as the regions with local positive signed curvature (concave) are effectively compressed, whereas those with negative signed curvature (convex) are under tension.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mechanics</title><p id="P15">We consider the cuticle as a bilayer volume consisting of an elastic film resting over a compliant substrate such as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>.

For the case in which the thickness stops growing before reaching the threshold, the delay also occurs but the change in wavelength is far less dramatic, the small difference is due to the extra length induced by the curved boundary, which allows the accommodation of an extra bump. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> shows the resulting patterns for each of the growth tensors and boundary conditions at the onset of the flat systems <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> at the onset of the curved cases <inline-formula><mml:math id="M10"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> and at the end of the computation <italic>t</italic> = 1.</p><p id="P26">Once the pattern has been triggered, the effect of further film expansion in the first principal direction is to increase the amplitude of the pattern without changing the wavenumber.

As the cells elongate in one preferred direction and the area of the petal increases, the in-plane area of the surface cells increases, as does the thickness of the top layer of the cuticle, the cuticle film. The increasing area of the average cell surface leads us to postulate expansion of the cuticle as the main mechanism behind the compressive stress responsible for the surface buckling. This is compatible with previous suggestions of ‘cuticle overproduction’ as the driving force. Equipped with this assumption, we then present a class of models which incorporate volume expansion into mechanical responses of a bilayer system.</p><p id="P46">In our models, cuticle production is interpreted as a local volume expansion of the layers, which results in in-plane stress. If the stress produced reaches a threshold then a pattern is triggered (critical growth condition), the threshold is determined by the stiffness mismatch ratio <italic>R</italic> &gt; 1 condition.</p><p id="P47">A first thing to notice is that buckling instabilities are triggered only after in-plane stress in a given direction exceeds a threshold value. In our case, this translates into the critical growth condition. If the expansion of the layer does not occur, then the system under consideration will not develop a buckled surface pattern. Also, even if cuticle is continuously produced, if the relative stiffness of the two layers is close to <italic>R</italic> ≃ 1 then a stable pattern will not form.</p><p id="P48">Therefore, a mono-layer system or a bilayer far from the threshold are adequate models for cuticles which retain a flat surface.</p><p id="P49">The scenarios explored here generate buckled morphologies following developmental paths resembling those of the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>trionum</italic> petal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Specifically, by imposing non-homogeneous boundary sub-domains, patterns are triggered locally in those regions with smaller curvatures before populating the full domain (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Once pattern formation is initiated, the effect of continuing cuticle expansion is an increase in the pattern amplitudes, while the wavelength remains constant on average. However, local differences in curvature introduce differences in the amount of in-plane growth required to reach the threshold. This effect, in turn, causes the pattern to be triggered asynchronously, occuring first in flatter regions and at cell junctions. This explains why the pattern is observed to develop in patchy domains, before covering the fully ridged petal sub-domain in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>trionum</italic>. The delay in reaching the buckling threshold has been numerically and analytically studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] for systems with a curvature field present in the reference configuration. The asynchronous onset of the pattern and variations in the curvature over each cell induce variability in the wavelength values.

The effect of a continuing film expansion after the pattern is triggered is the increase of the amplitudes. The pattern takes longer to fully populate the surface on curved substrates compared to the flat case. This implies that different curvature will lead to different amplitudes, which contributes to the variance observed in the data shown.
