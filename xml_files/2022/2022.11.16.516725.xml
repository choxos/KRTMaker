These glycans are displayed in low abundancies by cells commonly employed to propagate these viruses (MDCK and hCK), resulting in low or no viral propagation. Here, we examined whether the overexpression of the glycosyltransferases B3GNT2 and B4GALT1, which are responsible for the elongation of poly-N-acetyllactosamines (LacNAc), would result in improved A/H3N2 propagation. Stable overexpression of B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 in MDCK and hCK cells was achieved by lentiviral integration and subsequent antibiotic selection and confirmed by qPCR and protein mass spectrometry experiments. Flow cytometry and glycan mass spectrometry experiments using the B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 knock-in cells demonstrated increased binding of viral hemagglutinins and the presence of a larger number of LacNAc repeating units, especially on hCK-B3GNT2 cells. An increase in the number of glycan receptors did, however, not result in a greater infection efficiency of recent human H3N2 viruses. Based on these results, we propose that H3N2 IAVs require a low number of suitable glycan receptors to infect cells and that an increase in the glycan receptor display above this threshold does not result in improved infection efficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Influenza A viruses (IAV) of the H3N2 subtype cause seasonal epidemics, leading to illness, hospitalizations, and deaths in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The crucial first step of infection is the binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to a receptor on a cell, which are glycans terminating in α2,6-linked sialic acids (SIA) for human IAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. H3N2 viruses have been circulating in the human population since 1968 and due to continuous immune evasion, antigenic drift of the surface proteins of IAVs takes place. This antigenic drift of H3N2 viruses has changed receptor specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and recent H3N2 viruses bind to longer glycans having multiple consecutive oligo-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) moieties terminating in an α2,6-linked SIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This specificity is most pronounced for H3N2 viruses of subclade 3C.2a, which require at least three subsequent LacNAc repeating units for binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P3">These altered receptor specificities make it difficult to isolate and propagate H3N2 viruses, greatly hampering the further study of these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Even when virus isolation is successful, viruses may have acquired adaptive mutations in the receptor binding site of HA, especially when isolated in eggs instead of MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. MDCK cells have previously been modified to produce more α2,6-linked SIAs by the overexpression of the enzyme ST6GAL1, resulting in MDCK-SIAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and MDCK-AX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] cells. These cells enabled the isolation of H3N2 viruses, especially of the 3C.2a and 3C.3a subclades, and resulted in higher titers of viral stocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. To allow the isolation of further evolved contemporary H3N2 viruses, with higher titers and fewer mutations, MDCK cells were further modified to eliminate α2,3-linked SIAs while also overexpressing α2,6-linked SIAs, resulting in “humanized” MDCK (hCK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Analysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycans of MDCK, MDCK-SIAT1, and hCK cells indicated a low abundance of glycans with at least three successive LacNAc repeating units terminating in an α2,6-linked SIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The enzyme beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT2) is responsible for the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to glycans, while the galactose is transferred to the glycan by the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1). Previously, we successfully used these two enzymes to elongate LacNAc repeating units both in chemoenzymatic synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and on biological membrane surfaces of erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Here, we genetically engineered MDCK and hCK cells to overexpress B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 and demonstrated that this resulted in a higher relative abundance of <italic>N</italic>-glycans having elongated LacNAc moieties. Surprisingly, although the B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-in cells exhibited elevated binding of recent H3 HAs, the overexpression did not lead to improved virus isolation and infection efficiency. Several studies have indicated that a higher display of appropriate receptors leads to increased infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], while s indicated that only low amounts of receptors are required for infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Based on our studies, we concluded that above a required threshold, a greater number of suitable glycan receptors for H3N2 IAVs does not result in increased infection efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of stable B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 knock-in MDCK and hCK cell lines</title><p id="P6">Rearrangement of the sialyltransferase expression in hCK cells supported increased replication of many human H3N2 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

The genes were expressed from one human EF-1α promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and separated by P2A (and for double glycosyltransferase knock-ins also T2A) self-cleaving peptides. Lentiviruses were produced with a transfer plasmid and packaging plasmids, after which the viruses were used to transduce MDCK and hCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cells in which the genes were inserted in the genome were selected with Hygromycin B.</p><p id="P8">Stable overexpression of <italic>B3GNT2</italic> and <italic>B4GALT1</italic> was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis on isolated cellular RNA.

Only peptides unique for the human B3GNT2, B4GALT1, and ST6GAL1 were selected. The proteomic data is comparable to the RT-qPCR data since elevated protein levels in the cell lines with knock-ins were observed. Collectively, the data showed that the stable overexpression of B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 in MDCK and hCK was successful.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Flow cytometric characterization of B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 knock-in cells with plant and viral lectins</title><p id="P10">Next attention was focused on whether the overexpression of B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 led to a display of a higher number of LacNAc repeating units on <italic>N</italic>-glycans. The glycans on the cell surface were first characterized using flow cytometry with standard lectins. An alive, single-cell population was selected using a standard gating strategy, and mean fluorescence intensities were calculated over the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11"><italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> agglutinin (SNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] was used to detect α2,6-linked SIAs, which are present in higher quantities on hCK cells than MDCK cells due to the overexpression of ST6GAL1. The B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 knock-ins did not cause substantial differences in α2,6-linked SIA display, which is understandable since we did not interfere with the sialyltransferases. <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> lectin (LEL) recognizes elongated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and we observed that glycans capped with α2,6-linked SIAs need at least four consecutive LacNAc repeating units to be recognized, while glycans capped with α2,3-linked SIAs are recognized when presented on two successive LacNAc repeating units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>), which explains the lower signal for all hCK cells in general. A substantial increase in the binding of LEL to MDCK-B4GALT1 and MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 compared to WT MDCK cells was observed, indicating that the LacNAc repeating units on MDCK cells are indeed elongated by the overexpression of mainly B4GALT1. Moreover, we observed an increase in LEL signal in the hCK-B3GNT2 cells compared to the hCK WT cells, indicating that the overexpression of B3GNT2 resulted in the formation of longer glycans on hCK cells. <italic>Erythrina cristagalli</italic> lectin (ECA) recognizes terminal galactose, and thus glycans lacking SIA capping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The results using ECA indicated that all MDCK cells have a larger proportion of non-sialylated glycans compared to all hCK cells, which agrees with the overexpression of ST6GAL1 in all hCK cells. No major differences in the amount of non-sialylated glycans between WT and B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 knock-in cells were observed.</p><p id="P12">In addition to commonly employed plant lectins, viral proteins were used to examine the glycans displayed on the cells. The N-terminal domain of γCoV/AvCoV/guinea fowl/France/14032/2014 (Gf-CoV-2014 NTD) is known to bind elongated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. MDCK-B4GALT1 and MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 cells showed an increased Gf-CoV-2014 NTD signal compared to MDCK WT cells. Furthermore, hCK WT cells appeared to have a higher number of LacNAc repeating units on glycans than MDCK WT cells. The hCK-B3GNT2 cells, and the hCK-B4GALT1 and hCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 cells to a lesser extent, showed a substantial increase in Gf-CoV-2014 NTD binding compared to the hCK WT cells, indicating the presence of additional LacNAc repeating units on glycans. The HA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5 (H5VN) is commonly used to probe the presence of α2,3-linked SIAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].

The B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-ins did not alter the α2,3-linked SIA content. The HA of the human IAV A/Puerto-Rico/8/1934 (PR8) H1 binds α2,6-linked SIAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and showed increased binding to all hCK cells compared to all MDCK cells, which is related to the overexpression of ST6GAL1 in hCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Increased binding of PR8 to MDCK-B4GALT1 and MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 compared to MDCK WT cells was also observed, which deviates from the results obtained with SNA, with which no increase in α2,6-linked SIAs was shown.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>hCK-B3GNT2 cells are preferentially bound by contemporary H3 HAs</title><p id="P13">After initial characterization, an array of human H3 HAs was used for flow cytometric binding studies with B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To cover a broad scope of receptor binding specificities, HAs from viruses from different years (1968-2019) and (sub)clades were chosen. Three HAs from the 3C.2a subclade (A/Singapore/INFH-16-0019/2016, A/Netherlands/00010/2019, and A/Hong-Kong/4801/2014) were chosen to assess the presence of glycans with elongated LacNAc structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] on the MDCK and hCK WT and B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-in cells.</p><p id="P14">These human H3 HAs prefer binding to α2,6-linked SIAs over α2,3-linked SIAs and therefore, in general, more binding is observed to hCK WT cells than to MDCK WT cells. The HA of A/Hong-Kong/1/1968 does not require multiple consecutive LacNAc repeating units for binding, but it does show a strong preference for glycans with three or four consecutive LacNAc repeating units compared to glycans with only one or two repeating units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The preference of A/Hong-Kong/1/1968 for longer glycans is however not observed in our flow cytometry experiments, since the B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 knock-in cells did not show increased binding.</p><p id="P15">The human H3N2 IAVs A/Netherlands/109/2003 and A/Netherlands/761/2009 were previously shown to bind glycans with both two and three, but not one, consecutive LacNAc repeating units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Increased binding of A/Netherlands/109/2003 to MDCK-B4GALT1, MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1, and all hCK cells compared to MDCK WT cells was observed. Interestingly, the MDCK-B4GALT1 and MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 cells often showed comparable or higher binding to the recent H3 HAs than the hCK WT cells, while low levels of α2,6-linked SIAs are present on all MDCK cells.

Increased binding to MDCK-B4GALT1, MDCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1, and all hCK cell lines compared to MDCK WT cells was observed for the recent H3 HAs (2014-2019) A/Netherlands/354/2016, A/Singapore/INFH-16-0019/2016 (subclade 3C.2a), A/Kansas/14/2017 (3C.3a), and A/Netherlands/00010/2019 (subclade 3C.2a). The hCK-B3GNT2 cells that were already indicated to have the longest glycans by LEL and Gf-CoV-2014 NTD, also showed a substantial increase in binding of these recent H3 HAs compared to all other cell lines investigated. The strong binding to hCK-B3GNT2 cells of A/Hong-Kong/4801/2014 (subclade 3C.2a) was even more obvious, as other cell lines appear to be barely bound to this HA.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lectin binding to cells is concentration and sialic acid-dependent</title><p id="P17">To investigate whether the binding of the H3 HAs in the flow cytometry experiments was indeed specific for SIAs, we performed experiments with neuraminidase-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>).

The relative abundance of elongated glycans was even higher in hCK-B3GNT2-B4GALT1 cells. Surprisingly, hCK-B4GALT1 showed a substantial increase in the relative abundance of glycans with a higher number of LacNAc repeating units, up to even nine LacNAcs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>), which was not expected from the results of the flow cytometry experiments.

No other major differences or depletions of sugar nucleotides were observed in any of the cell lines. Most importantly, the sugar nucleotides that are required for the biosynthesis of LacNAc repeating units (UDP-galactose and UDP-HexNAc) were not depleted in any of the cell lines, thus sugar nucleotide availability is likely not a limiting factor for the elongation of glycans.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Improved binding of hemagglutinins to cells does ensure higher virus titers</title><p id="P24">MDCK WT, hCK WT, and B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 knock-in cells were inoculated with H3N2 viruses to investigate whether higher titers could be obtained in the knock-in cells.

To investigate whether cell lines with longer glycans (hCK-B3GNT2 cells) would facilitate the isolation of additional viruses, we attempted to isolate twelve H3N2 viruses (clade 3C.2a) from original patient material in hCK and hCK-B3GNT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Eight of those viruses could not be isolated previously since they did not replicate in hCK cells. All viruses that were previously isolated in hCK cells were again successfully isolated.

One of the viruses that was not isolated previously (A/Netherlands/173/2019) could now be isolated in both hCK and hCK-B3GNT2 cells. None of the other viruses that could not be isolated previously could now be isolated in either hCK or hCK-B3GNT2.

It has been reported that a low but critical threshold of high-affinity receptors is required for infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], though binding and infection are further assisted by the presence of high-abundance low-affinity receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This implies that increased HA binding will lead to enhanced entry efficiency. It is therefore counterintuitive that presenting preferred ligands in copious amounts does not lead to increased infection. Strikingly, here we demonstrated that increased HA binding to cells does not necessarily result in more efficient infection.</p><p id="P28">On the other hand, several studies have indicated that increasing the number of preferred receptors will increase the infection efficiency of IAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], which was also shown with MDCK-SIAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], MDCK-AX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and hCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] cells. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the glycoproteins on which <italic>N</italic>-glycans, the presumed glycan receptors for IAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], are presented. It has been suggested previously that only specific sialylated glycoproteins can be used as a receptor for IAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], such as the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], NKp44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], NKp46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], epidermal growth factor (EGFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], and nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Although we demonstrated that glycans on B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-in cells contained a higher number of LacNAc repeating units, we have not determined on which glycoproteins the elongated glycans are present. Possibly, the glycans that are used as a receptor and are present on specific glycoproteins can be modified in their SIA linkage, as done in MDCK-SIAT1, MDCK-AX4, and hCK cells, but not in the number of LacNAc repeating units. This would explain why the infection efficiency could not be increased by the elongation of LacNAc repeating units on MDCK and hCK cells.</p><p id="P29">Nevertheless, not all recent H3N2 IAVs could be isolated efficiently in hCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>. Possibly, no viable virus particles were present in the patient samples from which we attempted to isolate virus. Alternatively, we may be overlooking an identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] or an unidentified glycoprotein that is not present (in high enough quantities) on hCK cells. Additionally, our <italic>N</italic>-glycan analysis did not allow for exact glycan structure determination, and therefore it is unclear how many consecutive LacNAc repeating units are present on the glycans. Furthermore, other types of glycans, such as phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] and sulfated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], possibly act as a receptor for IAV. Due to our sample preparation for the released glycan mass spectrometry analysis, we were unable to measure phosphorylated and sulfated glycans. To increase the isolation of recent H3N2 IAVs, it is of foremost importance to investigate the limiting factor in the infection efficiency of these viruses.</p><p id="P30">The overexpression of B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 is responsible for the elongation of glycans. Previously, overexpression of B4GALT1 was found to result in the elongation of glycans on CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. From the flow cytometry analysis, B4GALT1 appeared to be the limiting factor for the elongation of glycans in MDCK cells, while the elongation was limited by B3GNT2 in hCK cells. The glycan mass spectrometry results showed that the relative abundance of glycans with high numbers of LacNAc repeating units was only marginally increased by the overexpression of either or both B3GNT2 and B4GALT1, while the glycans on hCK cells were elongated by the overexpression of either B3GNT2 or B4GALT1. The glycans that are investigated in both methods are different since we look at all glycans (<italic>N</italic>-glycans, <italic>O</italic>-glycans, and glycolipids) in flow cytometry experiments and only <italic>N</italic>-glycans during glycan mass spectrometry. In both methods, the hCK-B3GNT2 were shown to have the highest relative abundance of elongated LacNAc repeating units. In hCK cells, sialyltransferase expression is severely modified by the overexpression of ST6GAL1 and the knockout of all ST3GAL enzymes. Both the heavily overexpressed ST6GAL1 and B3GNT2 in hCK cells use galactose as a substrate. The overexpression of B3GNT2 in hCK cells perhaps restores the balance between ST6GAL1 and B3GNT2, thereby allowing B3GNT2 to use the galactose as a substrate again for the elongation of glycans before sialylation takes place. On the other hand, in MDCK cells, the balance may be skewed even more by the overexpression of B3GNT2, leading to the low sialylation of glycans on these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Our observations indicate that only few suitable glycan receptors are required for efficient infection. This is in line with our previous observations that a slight increase from 2.7% to 8.7% of sialylated glycans with at least three consecutive LacNAc repeating units on turkey erythrocytes allowed for the binding of contemporary H3N2 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Also in ferrets, an animal model that is often used to study human influenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], the presence of glycans in the respiratory tract (lung, trachea, soft palate, nasal turbinate, nasal wash) was investigated. Elongated glycans were present solely as <italic>N</italic>-glycans, with a maximum of 9 LacNAc repeating units per glycan, but at most 0.17% of the detected glycans had at least three consecutive LacNAc repeating units terminating with SIA, which is required for H3N2 IAV binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Although the glycans in the human trachea have not been analyzed yet, data is available on other parts of the human airway system. Sensitive methods indicated the presence of extended <italic>N</italic>-glycans with up to 10 LacNAc repeating units in human lung tissue. However, at most 0.3% of the <italic>N</italic>-glycans were found to contain at least 3 consecutive LacNAc repeating units.

Curves for titration experiments were smoothed using the standard settings.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Identification of <italic>N</italic>-glycans on cells by mass spectrometry</title><p id="P41">Cell lysates of WT and B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-in MDCK and hCK cells were obtained as described above. The total protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined using a BCA assay. The glycans in 400 µg of total protein were released by PNGaseF treatment. Proteins were first denatured in DTT/SDS (40 mM DTT, 0.5% v/v SDS) for 8 minutes at 95°C, after which they were cooled on ice. Subsequently, NP-40 (1% v/v) and glycobuffer G7 (50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.5) were added, together with 30 µg of PNGaseF. The samples were incubated in a shaking incubator overnight at 37°C. Samples were centrifuged (4700 rcf, 3 min) to remove potential precipitate, after which they were loaded on separate C18 SPE cartridges (Avantor™ 7020-02 BAKERBOND™ SPE Octadecyl), which were beforehand conditioned with 1 ml acetonitrile (MeCN) and 1 ml MQ water. The flow-through was collected and the remaining glycans were eluted from the C18 cartridges with 1 ml of 5% MeCN and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in MQ water. The MeCN and TFA in both samples were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. Flow through and elution fractions were diluted into 500 µl MQ water and combined, after which PGC SPE cartridges (Thermo Scientific™ HyperSep™ Hypercarb™ SPE cartridges) were used to further purify the samples. The PGC SPE cartridges were conditioned with 1 ml MeCN and 1 ml MQ water, after which the samples were loaded on the cartridges. The cartridges were washed with 1 ml 0.05% TFA in MQ water and 1 ml 5% MeCN with 0.05% TFA in MQ water. Samples were eluted with 50% MeCN and 0.1% TFA in MQ water and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried glycans were dissolved in 30 µl MQ water and 6 µl pure glacial acetic acid and labeled using 5 µl procainamide (105 mg/ml procainamide HCl in DMSO) and 5 µl 2-picoline borane (107 mg/ml 2-Methylpyridine borane complex in DMSO). The solution was vortexed thoroughly and incubated for 2 hours at 65°C, after which the samples were evaporated using the vacuum concentrator. The sample was dissolved in 300 µl MQ water and vortexed until the pellets were dissolved, after which 5 µl 25% (w/v) ammonia was added per sample to ensure a pH above 10. To remove the unused procainamide from the reaction mixture, liquid-liquid extraction with 500 µl dichloromethane was performed three times, with centrifuge steps of 4700 rcf for 3 min in between. The dichloromethane was removed and residual dichloromethane was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. The samples were dissolved in a total of 1 ml MQ water after which they were loaded onto PGC SPE cartridges (conditioned with 2 ml MeCN and 2 ml MQ water). The cartridges were washed with 2 ml MQ water and the glycans were eluted using 50% MeCN with 0.1% TFA in MQ water, after which the MeCN and TFA were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas, followed by lyophilization.</p><p id="P42">Before HILIC-IMS-QTOF analysis, the lyophilized samples were reconstituted in 15 µl 70% MeCN in MQ water and centrifuged. The injected volume was 10 µl. The HILIC-IMS-QTOF system was an Agilent 1260 Infinity LC coupled to a 6560 IM-QTOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). For HILIC separation, a SeQuant ZIC-cHILIC column (3 µm, 100 Å; 150 × 2.1 mm) was used with a matching guard column (20 × 2.1 mm). The temperature of the column compartment was set at 40 °C. The mobile phase was composed of eluent A: 10 mM ammonium formate with 10 mM formic acid in MQ water, and eluent B: LC-MS grade MeCN. The initial eluent composition was 30% A at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, followed by a linear gradient to 50% A from 0 to 20 minutes. 50% A was held isocratically until 25 minutes. To re-establish initial conditions, the column was flushed with at least 10 column volumes of 30% A.</p><p id="P43">The IMS-QTOF was set to positive ion mode with a capillary voltage of 3500 V, nozzle voltage of 2000 V, and a fragmentor voltage of 360 V. The drying gas temperature was 300 °C with a flow rate of 8 l/min and the sheath gas temperature was 300 °C at 11 l/min. The nebulizer pressure was set at 40 psi. The ion mobility settings were set as follows: 18 IM transients per frame, an IM trap fill time of 3900 µs and a release time of 250 µs, the drift tube voltage was 1400 V, and the multiplexing pulsing sequence length was 4 bits.</p><p id="P44">IM-MS data was calibrated to reference signals of m/z 121.050873 and 922.009798 using the IM-MS reprocessor utility of the Agilent Masshunter software. The mass-calibrated data was then demultiplexed using the PNNL preprocessor software using a 5-point moving average smoothing and interpolation of 3 drift bins. To find potential glycan hits in the processed data, the ‘find features’ (IMFE) option of the Agilent IM-MS browser was used with the following criteria: ‘Glycans’ isotope model, limited charge state to 5 and an ion intensity above 500. The found features were filtered by m/z range of 300 – 3200 and an abundance of over 500 (a.u.) where abundance for a feature was defined as ‘max ion volume’ (the peak area of the most abundant ion for that feature).</p><p id="P45">After exporting the list of filtered features, glycans with a mass below 1129 Da (the mass of an <italic>N</italic>-glycan core) were removed. The ExPASy GlycoMod tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] was used to search for glycan structures (monoisotopic mass values, 5 ppm mass tolerance, neutral, derivatized N-linked oligosaccharides, procainamide (mass 235.168462302) as reducing terminal derivative, looking for underivatized monosaccharide residues (Hexose, HexNAc, Deoxyhexose, and NeuAc)). For features with multiple potential monosaccharide combinations, the most realistic glycan in the biological context was chosen. The abundance of glycan features with the same mass, composition, and a maximum difference of 0.1 min in the retention time were combined as one isomer. Full glycan composition feature lists for the different cell lines are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1-8</xref>.</p><p id="P46">Analysis of the number of LacNAc repeating units was performed on the complex and hybrid <italic>N</italic>-glycans with at least one LacNAc repeating unit. A glycan with one LacNAc repeating unit was defined as a glycan with 4 hexoses and a minimum of 3 HexNAcs or 3 HexNAcs and at least 4 hexoses. A glycan with two LacNAc repeating units was defined as a glycan with 5 hexoses and a minimum of 4 HexNAcs or 4 HexNAcs and at least 5 hexoses. This pattern was continued for the higher numbers of LacNAc repeating units. The total absolute abundance of all selected glycans was added up, after which the relative abundance of a given number of LacNAc repeating units was calculated from this total. Additionally, the percentage of these glycans with at least one SIA was calculated.</p><p id="P47">Chromatograms of the <italic>N</italic>-glycans with two to seven LacNAc repeating units, calculated as described above, from hCK WT and hCK-B3GNT2 cells were constructed using Agilent’s Masshunter Qualtitative Analysis 10.0 software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The shown chromatograms are the summed extracted-ion-count (EIC) for the ten most abundant glycan features per LacNAc repeating unit group. The EIC for a glycan was set as the observed m/z value with a symmetrical 10 ppm expansion. Different ionization states of the same glycan that were found as a separate feature by the feature-finding software were also included in the summed EIC chromatogram.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Sugar nucleotide analysis</title><p id="P48">Cells were grown to 60-70% confluency in a 6-wells plate, after which the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with wash buffer (75 mM ammonium carbonate in MQ water, pH 7.4 (corrected with glacial acetic acid), at 4°C). The cells were then treated with 700 µl of extraction buffer (40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, 20% MQ water, at 4°C) per well for 2 minutes, after which the supernatant was transferred to a vial. This extraction step is repeated for 3 minutes, after which the two extracts were pooled and centrifuged at 18000 rcf for 3 min. The supernatant was taken and dried in the vacuum concentrator. Samples were frozen at −80°C until analysis using an ion-pair UHPLC-QqQ 1290-6490 Agilent mass spectrometer by Glycomscan BV (Oss, the Netherlands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Virus titration on B3GNT2/B4GALT1 knock-in MDCK and hCK cells</title><p id="P49">Virus titers in the virus stocks in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> were determined using end-point titration in MDCK cells and inoculated cell cultures were tested for agglutination activity using turkey red blood cells as an indicator of virus replication in the cells. For recent (2017-2019) H3N2 viruses, no binding to erythrocytes was observed and therefore virus titers were determined using a nucleoprotein (NP) staining. The NP staining was performed on the inoculated cells that were fixed with acetone for at least 20 minutes at −20°C. Primary mouse anti-NP antibody (HB65, 2 mg/ml) was diluted 1:3000 and the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG HRP antibody (A16702, 1 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at a dilution of 1:30000, after which 50 µl per well was used for both solutions. True Blue substrate (KPL) was then added to visualize positive wells using an ImmunoSpot Analyzer (CTL Europe, Bonn, Germany). Based on the negative control values and the highest positive values per plate, the cut-off for positivity was determined.
