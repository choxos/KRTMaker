Advances in genomics enable the inference of gene regulatory programs that are active during development. However, this approach cannot capture the complex multicellular interactions that occur during embryogenesis. Compared to model organisms such as fruit flies and zebrafish, the growth of mammalian embryos <italic>in utero</italic> further complicates the analysis of cell-cell communication during development. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> models of mammalian development such as gastruloids can overcome this limitation. Using time-resolved single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, we have delineated the regulatory landscape during gastruloid development and thereby identified the critical drivers of developmental transitions. We observed that gastruloids develop from pluripotent cells driven by the transcription factor (TF) dimer OCT4-SOX2 and differentiate along two main branches. A mesoderm branch characterized by the TF MSGN1 and a spinal cord branch characterized by CDX1, 2, 4 (CDX). Consistent with our lineage reconstruction, ΔCDX gastruloids fail to form spinal cord. Conversely, <italic>Msgn1</italic> ablation inhibits the development of paraxial mesoderm, as expected. However, this also abolished spinal cord cells, which is surprising given that MSGN1 is not associated with differentiation along this branch. Therefore, formation of paraxial mesoderm is required for spinal cord development. To validate this, we generated chimeric gastruloids using ΔMSGN1 and wildtype cells, which formed both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm. Strikingly, ΔMSGN1 cells specifically contributed to spinal cord, suggesting that cell-cell interactions between paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord are necessary for the formation of the latter. Our work has important implications for the study of cell-cell communication in development and how gene regulatory programs are functionally executed to form complex multicellular developmental structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Gastruloids are self-organizing, stem cell-based synthetic embryos that can reproducibly recapitulate key aspects of the early stages of post-occipital embryonic development. Gastruloids are generated by aggregating 300 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) for 48 hours followed by a 24 hour pulse of the Wnt pathway agonist Chiron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the resulting cellular aggregates undergo germ layer specification and symmetry breaking, and can develop primitive organ structures such as spinal cord, somites, cardiac progenitors, blood and vascular tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, gastruloids are a valuable model to study development <italic>in vitro</italic> in a multi-tissue context. Individual cells within and across these tissues interact with each other physically and biochemically and the ensemble of these interacting cells can be viewed as a cell regulatory network (CRN) that orchestrates the emergence of tissue-level properties and determines the relationships between different tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Transcription within the individual cells of the CRN is driven by transcription factors (TFs), which act as central nodes inside gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control key cellular processes such as cell differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Linking GRNs, which are almost by definition cell intrinsic to cell-cell cooperation within a CRN is crucial for understanding developmental dynamics. Defining and perturbing the active TFs during gastruloid development may allow us to determine how alterations in the GRNs are propagated to the CRN level, and thereby advance our understanding of self-organization.</p><p id="P3">TFs are DNA binding proteins, but inside the context of the nucleus, nucleosomes can form a barrier for TF binding to gene regulatory elements. Therefore, the physical accessibility of these regions in chromatin acts as a regulatory mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Differences in accessible chromatin regions can modulate the availability of regulatory elements for TF binding in a tissue-specific manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Chromatin accessibility is established by pioneer TFs and chromatin remodeling complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, paving the way for secondary TFs to bind these sequences. By measuring chromatin accessibility genome-wide by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATACseq) we can identify potential regulatory regions in a tissue. By analyzing the DNA binding motifs enriched in these regions it is possible to identify TFs associated with specific cell identities during gastruloid development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In order to capture the gene regulatory complexity within developing gastruloids, we resorted to time course single cell combinatorial indexing ATACseq (sciATACseq) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and delineated the main regulatory subtypes in mouse gastruloids. We found that these subtypes strongly match their embryonic counterpart. By studying TF DNA binding motif enrichment along the regulatory trajectories of the cell types we identified the TFs CDX and MSGN1 as drivers of the early cell fate decisions generating the two main developmental branches (spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm respectively). In particular, we determined that <italic>Cdx</italic> genes promote neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) differentiation and spinal cord development, but are dispensable for mesoderm formation. Moreover, we found that ablation of MSGN1 causes impairment of paraxial mesoderm differentiation as well as cross-lineage inhibition of spinal cord formation. To discriminate between the intrinsic and extrinsic roles of MSGN1 we combined genetic deletion with chimeric gastruloid formation and found that in chimeric gastruloids MSGN1 null cells contribute efficiently to spinal cord formation. Altogether our work represents a novel framework for delineating GRNs and determining how perturbations to the GRN are propagated to the CRN and affect gastruloid development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>sciATACseq identifies regulatory cell fate transitions during gastruloid development</title><p id="P5">To define the gene regulatory landscape guiding gastruloid development, we probed a modified version of sciATACseq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) on gastruloids derived from E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and collected at 72 (i.e. 24h post chiron treatment), 80, 88, 96 and 120h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). We also included gastruloids that were cultured in 5% Matrigel between 96 and 120h, which develop into trunk-like structures (TLS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). We obtained high quality chromatin accessibility data for 12,575 nuclei with a median of 18,845 unique fragments per nucleus and an average fraction of reads in peaks (FriP) of 0.336 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-F</xref>). To determine whether clearly defined subtypes exist, we performed UMAP visualization of the single cell accessibility data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cluster analysis identified 8 cell subtypes originating from a progenitor population which differentiate along a temporal trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The proportion of progenitor cells diminishes sharply from 72h onward and essentially disappears at 96h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We detected a cluster likely representing endoderm/gut which comprised very few cells. These cells were excluded from the rest of the analysis on the basis of them being very rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> we show chromatin accessibility for individual cells and as aggregate signal for the different clusters nearby the developmentally important <italic>Irx3</italic> gene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We observed regions that are ubiquitously accessible across all clusters, which often coincide with promoter regions (e.g. the promoter of the <italic>Irx3</italic> gene). On the other hand, we found distal regulatory regions that are accessible only in a subset of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We observe that the vast majority of promoter-proximal peaks are not differential during gastruloid development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>). To determine cell type specific regulatory elements, we defined accessible chromatin regions specific to each subpopulation. To this end we calculated the differentially accessible (DA) peaks for each cluster and will be referred to as marker peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Gastruloid regulatory landscapes strongly resemble <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts</title><p id="P7">For gastruloids to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> model for developmental gene regulatory networks the regulatory landscapes in gastruloids should resemble <italic>in vivo</italic> regulatory landscapes. To determine this we compared our dataset with sciATACseq data generated from embryonic day E8.25 mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, which is right after gastrulation and at the beginning of organogenesis. Similarities between early embryos and gastruloids were calculated by integrating the nuclei from our dataset with nuclei from the embryo dataset and made quantitative predictions using support-vector machine (SVM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We found a high degree of similarity between most gastruloid subpopulations and the embryo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used the SVM predictions to assign labels to gastruloid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We identified gastruloid subtypes corresponding to NMPs, spinal cord cells, paraxial mesoderm, pharyngeal mesoderm, somitic mesoderm and endothelium. The majority of these cell types are found in post-occipital tissues, with the exception of pharyngeal mesoderm which is an anterior tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Among the populations detected, we identified two intermediate cell types. Somitic mesoderm represents an intermediate state which is strongly reduced at 120h, after giving origin to paraxial mesoderm at 96h and pharyngeal mesoderm at 120h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Similarly, the NMP pool, known to give rise to spinal cord cells <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, is reduced at 120h when spinal cord cells increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We failed to convincingly predict a corresponding embryo cell type for the progenitor cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), therefore we speculated that these cells are similar to the starting mESC population. Indeed, marker peaks for the progenitor cluster show specific enrichment in bulk ATACseq data from E14 mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To orthogonally confirm our labeling, we plotted pseudobulk chromatin accessibility of the embryo sciATACseq data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This shows that cell-type specific accessible regions in gastruloids are also accessible in the embryo counterparts. These patterns are further exemplified by the chromatin accessibility landscape near known cell type-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The cell types that we identified are consistent with the cell types found in gastruloid scRNAseq data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Taken together, these analyses indicate that gastruloids contain several regulatory subpopulations which faithfully recapitulate important aspects of the post-occipital embryonic regulatory landscape.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Chromatin state transitions highlight developmental trajectories in gastruloids</title><p id="P8">Our time-resolved sciATACseq dataset enables us to determine the regulatory cascade underlying gastruloid development. To this end we performed pseudotime analysis, which orders cells along the progression of an imputed differentiation trajectory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We identified three main pseudotime trajectories starting from the progenitor cells: I) NMP-spinal cord, II) somitic mesoderm-paraxial mesoderm and III) somitic mesoderm-pharyngeal mesoderm. The paraxial and pharyngeal mesoderm trajectories consist of a common root originating at the progenitor population and transitioning through the somitic mesoderm population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These trajectories corroborate that NMPs give origin to spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, in contrast with the established origin of somitic mesoderm from NMPs in mouse embryos, our pseudotime analysis suggests that in gastruloids, mesoderm cells can be directly derived from the progenitor cluster <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Discussion</xref> for more details). It should be noted that we could not determine a trajectory for the endothelial cluster and therefore also no endothelial precursor cells. The developmental trajectories that we identified can be used as a starting point to define the regulatory cascade contributing to cell fate specification and morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TF motif accessibility along cell trajectories reveals potential drivers of cell fate decisions</title><p id="P9">The changes in the regulatory landscape during gastruloid development are largely driven by TFs. To identify key driver TFs binding to cell type specific regulatory elements, we performed DNA binding motif enrichment analysis on the DA peaks. We found that in the progenitor cluster regulatory elements were enriched for the pluripotency-associated motif OCT4::SOX2, bound by OCT4 and SOX2, and binding sites for the Wnt effector TF TCF3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). TCF3 binding to the OCT4::SOX2 motif in ESCs has been suggested to compete with SOX2 binding and counteract pluripotency, indicating that the cells in the progenitor cluster are undergoing differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Accordingly, a subset of the progenitor cells shows enrichment of the binding motif of mesoderm marker TBXT (a.k.a. Brachyury) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Next, to identify the TFs that potentially drive subpopulation development we calculated TF motif enrichment along the pseudotime trajectories. We decided to focus on the two main branches we identified: the NMP-spinal cord and the somitic mesoderm-paraxial mesoderm trajectory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">On the NMP-spinal cord trajectory, we observed a decrease in the enrichment of the OCT4::SOX2 and TCF3 motifs as the progenitor cells transition to the NMP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). The binding motif of CDX2 (highly overlapping with CDX1 and CDX4 motifs) is highly enriched in the NMP population. Interestingly, we find the CDX2 motif also enriched in a subset of cells within the progenitor population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">This indicates that these cells are already primed for differentiation towards the NMP-spinal cord trajectory. We found that the levels of CDX2 motif enrichment decreased again upon differentiation of NMPs into spinal cord cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3B-C</xref>), pattern indicating that CDX1, 2, 4 TFs may be specifically required in the NMP stage and no longer necessary once the cells differentiate further. Supporting this hypothesis, it has been shown that <italic>Cdx</italic> genes maintain the NMP state by suppressing the retinoic acid signaling pathway which is required for differentiation of NMPs into spinal cord cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. When we re-analyzed gastruloid scRNAseq for the expression of <italic>Cdx1</italic>, -<italic>2</italic> and -<italic>4</italic> in NMPs, we found that in the majority of NMPs <italic>Cdx2</italic> was expressed at a higher level than <italic>Cdx1</italic> and -<italic>4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, consistent with the observation that CDX2 plays a prominent role in posterior axis elongation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. During the transition from NMPs to spinal cord, we detected an increase of SOX2 and RFX4 motif enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In line with the motif analysis, RFX4 is expressed in spinal cord cells in gastruloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). RFX4 has been shown to promote ventral spinal cord development in mice by inducing Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling to ensure primary cilia formation and represents a marker of spinal cord differentiation in gastruloids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. SOXB family members have a binding motif highly similar to that of SOX2 and have been implicated in neural differentiation and in spinal cord differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In gastruloids spinal cord cells express SOX1, -2, -3 and -21 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). SOX2 in particular is known to promote the exit from the NMP stage and the differentiation into spinal cord cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Next, we analyzed the TF motifs found in the somitic mesoderm-paraxial mesoderm trajectory. Similar to the NMP-spinal cord trajectory, we observed the OCT4::SOX2 and TCF3 motif enrichment decreasing abruptly when transitioning from progenitors to the somitic mesoderm and acquiring enrichment for the binding motif of MSGN1 (Mesogenin1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Along this trajectory, we already detect an enrichment of the MSGN1 motif within a proportion of the progenitor cells, suggesting that these progenitors become primed for differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). When the cells enter the paraxial mesoderm state, we see that MSGN1 and TBX6 motif enrichment is rapidly decreased, consistent with a role for MSGN1 and TBX6 that is restricted specifically to somitic mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, MSGN1 is known to promote the transition between mesoderm progenitor cells and presomitic mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. TBX6 has been reported to induce MSGN1 expression which could explain why TBX6 enrichment precedes MSGN1 motif enrichment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also found an enrichment for the motif of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) TF TWIST1 in the paraxial mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the embryo, EMT is crucial to transition from the initial primitive streak epithelial cells towards paraxial mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. When we determined TF motif enrichment dynamics across cellular states we did not observe sharp transitions (except for the endothelial cluster), but rather a continuous modulation of the level of accessibility of these motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). These observations suggest that cells do not suddenly acquire a differentiated phenotype but rather transition from a progenitor state to an intermediate state, where TFs associated with either progenitor or differentiated states bind chromatin simultaneously in the same cells. In conclusion, the analysis of TF binding motifs along the developmental trajectories allowed us to identify relevant lineage-specific TF activities and infer their dynamics during cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, we found that priming for differentiation occurs already at the (intermediate) progenitor states.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>Cdx</italic> genes drive posterior elongation by inducing NMP differentiation into spinal cord but not into paraxial mesoderm</title><p id="P13">Given the transient gain of open chromatin regions enriched for the CDX motif in the NMP-spinal cord branch we wanted to test the functional requirement of CDX1,2,4 in the formation of spinal cord cells during gastruloid development. To this end we attempted to generate gastruloids from ΔCDX1,2,4 (ΔCDX) HM1 mESCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Compared to gastruloids formed from wild-type (WT) HM1 mESCs, the ΔCDX mESCs failed to form elongated structures during the 120h of the gastruloid differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Although the observed structures are lacking some key features of gastruloids, we will refer to them as gastruloids for the sake of clarity and on the basis of that they went through the gastruloid protocol. The observed phenotype mimics the effect of <italic>Cdx</italic> deletions in mouse embryos, which leads to a failure in posterior axis elongation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Based on our pseudotime trajectory we would predict decreased formation of SOX2-positive spinal cord cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Indeed, ΔCDX gastruloids displayed reduced expression of the spinal cord marker SOX2 when compared to WT gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe differences in expression of the mesoderm marker FOXC1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> in ΔCDX gastruloids compared to WT gastruloids, suggesting that ΔCDX gastruloids are still capable of forming paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Additionally, we observed that TBXT expression, partially co-localizing with CDX2 expressing cells at the posterior end of WT gastruloids, was diminished and diffused throughout ΔCDX gastruloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-B</xref>). Taken together, differentiation in the ΔCDX structures is diverted from the spinal cord towards the mesoderm.</p><p id="P14">Although the immunofluorescence analysis is useful for measuring the spatial distribution of marker genes it cannot determine the composition of regulatory subtypes in the ΔCDX gastruloids. Therefore, we performed sciATACseq at 120h in WT gastruloids and ΔCDX gastruloids. WT HM1 gastruloids displayed a cell-type composition similar to our E14 WT 120h gastruloids, indicating that our sciATACseq and gastruloid protocols are robust and reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). ΔCDX gastruloids displayed a near absence of NMPs and a strong reduction of spinal cord, consistent with our immunofluorescence results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Additionally, we observed a strong increase of paraxial mesoderm cells. This shows that the impairment in spinal cord specification is compensated by the acquisition of a paraxial mesodermal fate. Importantly, this confirms our prediction that paraxial mesoderm in gastruloids does not derive from NMPs.. These observations strengthen the finding that <italic>Cdx</italic> genes act in a trajectory-specific manner by promoting the formation of NMPs and, by extension, spinal cord cells. However, <italic>Cdx</italic> genes are not required for mesoderm differentiation. This suggests that, in gastruloids, NMPs are not a bipotent progenitor pool but they contribute solely to spinal cord development. In summary, <italic>Cdx</italic> genes are required for spinal cord formation but not for paraxial mesoderm differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>MSGN1+ cells are required for spinal cord formation</title><p id="P15">Because we observed an enrichment of the MSGN1 motif in the somitic mesoderm-paraxial mesoderm pseudotime trajectory, we investigated the role of MSGN1 during gastruloid development. We performed gastruloid differentiation using ΔMSGN1 mESCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> which yield non-elongating structures when compared to WT cells at 120h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G-H</xref>). Moreover, we observed that ΔMSGN1 gastruloids presented multiple CDX2+/TBXT+ protrusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C, E</xref>). Based on our pseudotime analysis, we predicted MSGN1 to promote mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). The drastic reduction in FOXC1 expressing cells in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids when compared to WT gastruloids confirmed these predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-J</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also observed a reduction in SOX2+ spinal cord cells in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4K-L</xref>). sciATACseq analysis of ΔMSGN1 gastruloids showed a massive shift of paraxial mesoderm to pharyngeal mesoderm (barely detected in WT cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E, K, L</xref>). This suggests that MSGN1 is promoting paraxial mesoderm identity while suppressing the emergence of pharyngeal mesoderm, consistent with <italic>Msgn1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant mouse embryos exhibiting loss of paraxial mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. To our surprise, the sciATACseq did not detect any cells with a regulatory landscape reflecting spinal cord cells in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids. Additionally, we observed a strong reduction in the percentage of NMPs. This contrasted with our prediction, since the MSGN1 motif is depleted in the cells that form the spinal cord trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We conclude that within the developing gastruloids there are dependencies between the trajectories that are not readily apparent from our sciATACseq analysis. We hypothesize that defects in spinal cord formation in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids result from a defect in a cross-lineage mechanism involving paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord cells that guides neural fate acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We reasoned that if the differentiation of NMPs to spinal cord cells is independent of MSGN1, but rather is dependent on the interaction between different cell types, differentiation from NMPs to spinal cord cells should occur when this interacting environment is extrinsically provided. Gastruloids are the ideal model system for this as it is possible to mix different mESC lines to create chimeric gastruloids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This approach provides a unique opportunity to dissect lineage extrinsic regulatory pathways. To test whether ΔMSGN1 could form spinal cord cells when provided with the correct cellular environment we generated chimeric gastruloids composed of an equal mix of WT and ΔMSGN1 mESCs. To be able to track WT and ΔMSGN1 cells, we labeled the cells with mCherry and EGFP, respectively. Since labeling the HM1 mCherry+ WT line failed to reproducibly form gastruloids (data not shown), we resorted to E14 WT mCherry+ cells for the following experiments. Note that HM1 and E14 are both derived from 129 mice (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">method</xref> section for details).</p><p id="P17">In contrast to the gastruloids derived from ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ cells only, chimeric gastruloids consisting of WT mCherry+ and ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ cells were elongated at 120h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). In fact, elongation rates in chimeric gastruloids were similar to WT gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This shows that in chimeras, WT mCherry+ cells can compensate for the lack of MSGN1 in half of the initial cell pool and restore gastruloid elongation. Strikingly, in the chimeric gastruloids, ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ cells were enriched at the posterior end of the chimeric gastruloids, while WT mCherry+ cells were distributed along the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, C</xref>)..</p><p id="P18">To determine the contribution of WT mCherry+ and ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ cells to mesoderm and spinal cord, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of lineage markers. We did not observe multiple CDX2+/TBXT+ protrusions in ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ gastruloids as opposed to our experiments with the untagged cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). We think this could have resulted from repeatedly subculturing the ΔMSGN1 mESCs in order to achieve EGFP tagging of the cells. Compared to WT mCherry+ gastruloids, ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ gastruloids showed a strong reduction in FOXC1+ mesoderm as well as SOX2+ spinal cord, consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). Importantly, chimeric gastruloids displayed SOX2+ spinal cord and FOXC1+ mesoderm regions comparable to WT mCherry+ gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). In the chimeras, we observed both FOXC1+ and SOX2+ positive cells derived from the WT mCherry+ mESCs, meaning that they contributed to both spinal cord and mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, G</xref>). However, more importantly, we observed that in chimeras ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ cells expressed SOX2+ but displayed lower levels of FOXC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E, G</xref>). This indicates that the presence of mesoderm formed by WT cells rescues the capacity of ΔMSGN1 cells to form spinal cord cells, and therefore provides strong evidence of a cell fate induction mechanism that promotes spinal cord identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Together with the fact that in chimeras ΔMSGN1 EGFP+ did not form FOXC1+ mesoderm efficiently, we have shown that MSGN1 is cell autonomously required for mesoderm formation, but is required in a cross-lineage manner for spinal cord differentiation. Taken together these data provide evidence that the paraxial mesoderm appears to be a critical guiding component in order for NMPs to progress to spinal cord.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Here, we systematically dissect the chromatin regulatory landscape during mouse gastruloid development, defining the main regulatory subtypes that arise in this synthetic embryo model. We find that besides the initial progenitor pool, the majority of the subpopulations have a high degree of resemblance to their counterparts in post-gastrulation embryos. This resemblance suggests that gastruloids faithfully recapitulate cell types and associated regulatory landscapes in posterior embryo development, complementing the findings of transcriptomic studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. For most of the identified subpopulations, we were able to define clear developmental trajectories stemming from the progenitor cluster. However, we did not find a trajectory explaining the emergence of the endothelial population, which was found almost exclusively found at 120h in our sciATACseq dataset. This late emergence suggests that their origin may be pinpointed by including additional time points between 96 and 120h. However, a recent transcriptomic study indicates that endothelial cells derive from mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. When analyzing TF DNA binding motif enrichment along the main developmental trajectories, we observed that from each (intermediate) progenitor state to the next population, the cells enter a “bivalent” state, i.e. display enrichment for accessibility of the motifs of OCT4::SOX2 as well as of either MSGN1 or CDX2, suggesting that progenitors undergo regulatory priming before differentiation. It remains to be determined whether in these bivalent cells the OCT4:SOX2 accessible sites (and the genes they control) act as a break to differentiation. In line with this hypothesis, OCT4 has been suggested to prevent differentiation of pluripotent cells to trophectoderm by repressing CDX2 activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Similarly, a dominant negative form of SOX2 has been shown to induce trophectoderm differentiation of mESCs, suggesting that SOX2 prevents exit from pluripotency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These mechanisms could also be relevant to prevent differentiation of progenitors in gastruloids.</p><p id="P20">The gastruloids derived from ΔCDX mESCs lacked NMPs, but still had a limited number of spinal cord cells. The presence of these spinal cord cells in absence of NMPs suggests that cell differentiation is not following rigid trajectories but may undertake alternative paths when the canonical ones are defective. This alternative path and therefore the origin of the spinal cord cells in ΔCDX gastruloids is still unclear. One possibility is that they are directly derived from the progenitor pool thus bypassing the NMP stage. Alternatively, as CDX genes are required for NMP state maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, the spinal cord cells in ΔCDX gastruloids may derive from NMPs that were present at an earlier stage during development but have disappeared at the final time point which prevents them to substantially contribute to the spinal cord population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Based on our pseudotime analyses, we did not find NMPs at the base of the spinal cord/mesoderm fork, as previously suggested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Rather we imputed that NMPs give origin to spinal cord cells, while the mesoderm lineages arise directly from the progenitor pool. This is line with a recent single cell transcriptomic analysis that proposes the presence of both NMP-dependent and NMP-independent developmental trajectories in gastruloids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, we do not detect any clear NMP-dependent trajectory towards somitic mesoderm in the sciATACseq. These <italic>in vitro</italic> findings are in stark contrast with a large body of evidence suggesting that <italic>in vivo</italic> NMPs are bipotent cells capable of forming both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Nonetheless if, as our data suggests, the lineage-restricted NMPs found in gastruloids are equivalent to NMPs in the embryo, it would imply that NMPs <italic>in vivo</italic> are not a homogeneous population but are rather represented by specialized subpopulations that can either differentiate to spinal cord or mesoderm cells. Consistent with our predictions, ΔCDX gastruloids were still able to form paraxial mesoderm in abundance. One possibility is that a subset of the gastruloid progenitor pool, which shows enrichment for SOX2 and TBXT motifs, represents an NMP-like population that does not match with E8.25 cells but could represent earlier embryonic NMPs. Our finding that ΔCDX gastruloids do not axially elongate recapitulates the phenotype of <italic>Cdx</italic> null mice, which fail to generate posterior tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. NMPs in gastruloids are not only necessary to generate spinal cord cells but are essential for posterior end polarization, likely by the formation of a signaling center that secretes both Wnt and Fgf ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">By analyzing a mutant of the main driver of the paraxial mesoderm trajectory, we demonstrated that the intrinsic role of MSGN1 is to promote the formation of paraxial mesoderm in gastruloids. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>) This finding is in line with <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showing that in mice <italic>Msgn1</italic> deletion leads to paraxial mesoderm loss <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our observation of TBXT+ cells in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids raises the possibility that these cells may be blocked in their differentiation path to paraxial mesoderm. Consistent with this, MSGN1 has been suggested to repress WNT3A signaling, which in turn promotes TBXT expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Indeed, MSGN1 has been shown to repress TBXT expression. This repression could be required to progress into paraxial mesoderm, since MSGN1 null embryos present increased TBXT expression in immature paraxial mesoderm progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Our pseudotime analysis suggests that, similar to paraxial mesoderm, the pharyngeal mesoderm originates from somitic mesoderm. Strikingly, we see that in ΔMSGN1 gastruloids there is an increase in pharyngeal mesoderm, indicating that MSGN1 suppresses pharyngeal mesoderm formation at the advantage of paraxial mesoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>). Moreover, when we aimed to generate gastruloids from ΔMSGN1 ESCs, the resulting structures completely lacked spinal cord cells as well, which is in contrast with our prediction of MSGN1 driving only the mesoderm branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>). The use of chimeric WT/ΔMSGN1 gastruloids enabled us to disentangle the cell-intrinsic versus the cross-lineage roles of MSGN1. The fact that ΔMSGN1 cells, in the presence of WT-derived paraxial mesoderm, are able to efficiently differentiate into spinal cord cells shows that the communication between the paraxial mesoderm lineage and the spinal cord lineage is crucial for the formation of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Importantly, our observation that paraxial mesoderm induces spinal cord development is partially supported by observations in MSGN1 null mice which lack paraxial mesoderm and display a kinked neural tube accompanied with a reduction of SOX2 expression in the tail bud region of the embryo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. However, the fact that MSGN1 null mice present only mild defects in neural tube formation might indicate that in the embryo the anterior tissues compensate for the absence of the paraxial mesoderm. Thus, CRN properties that are not evident in the complexity of the embryo can be brought to bear by the limited cell type composition of the gastruloid model.</p><p id="P23">CRNs cannot be studied in simple monocultures, since they require, by definition for multiple cell types to interact.

Moreover, we excluded peaks that were within 1.5kb of a TSS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> (exclude promoter bit). Term frequency – inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a log transformation on the TF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, term was used as a weighting scheme for the binarized count matrix. The irlba package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> was used to perform partial singular value decomposition of the scaled and centered TF-IDF matrix for the first 100 left and right singular vectors. The diagonal matrix was multiplied by the left singular vectors to obtain principal components. The mutual nearest neighbour method, per the ‘reducedMNN’ function in the batchelor R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, was used on the principal components to integrate cells from different batches. The 2<sup>nd</sup>-50<sup>th</sup> corrected principal components were used to compute UMAPs using the uwot R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> with the arguments ‘metric = “cosine”, init = “agspectral”’.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Clustering and marker detection</title><p id="P36">Clustering of cells was performed using the Leiden algorithm on a shared nearest neighbour (SNN) graph computed on the batch-integrated principal components. The SNN graph was computed using the ‘makeSNNGraph’ function from the bluster R/Bioconductor package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> with the argument ‘k = 15’. The ‘cluster_leiden’ function from the igraph <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> R package was used for clustering, with the ‘resolution_parameter = 0.1’ argument. Marker genes were detected using logistic regression to predict cells that had a fragment overlapping a peak from the total reads in peaks for a cell, cell-wise GC bias, batch membership and cluster membership. 20% of cells in each cluster were randomly combined to form a reference level for the cluster membership variable. In this regression, when the cluster membership had a significant log-odds ratio as determined by a Wald test after adjusting for false discovery rate, the peak was considered a marker peak for the tested cluster.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Motif analysis</title><p id="P37">Position frequency matrices of motifs were obtained with the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> R/Bioconductor package from the vertebrates taxonomical group and core collection. For analysing motifs, we looked at the DNA content of peaks where cluster membership was a significant factor according to a likelihood ratio test, comparing the logistic regression model described above against a reduced model where cluster membership was omitted from the predictor variables. Peaks were then scanned for motif matches using the ‘matchMotifs’ function from the motifmatchr <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> R/Bioconductor package. Motif Z-scores stabilised for GC bias were then computed using the chromVAR R/Bioconductor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> package.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Pseudotime analysis</title><p id="P38">Diffusion pseudotime was calculated with the destiny R/Bioconductor package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> using the ‘DiffusionMap’ function with the ‘distance = “cosine”’ argument, using the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> corrected principal components as data The pseudotime was extracted using the ‘DPT’ function from the destiny package. The cells in the endothelium and endoderm clusters were omitted from this computation due to their apparent discontinuity from other clusters. From the diffusion maps, it was inferred that differentiation largely occurred along two branches originating from the same progenitor cluster. Based on the diffusion maps, a decision was made to split cell into a spinal cord arm and mesoderm arm according to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Comparison with embryo</title><p id="P39">Peaks were called as described above on combined fragments from both the embryo data and our gastruloids data. Cell annotations were taken from the supplementary data of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Fragments were counted in these peaks to generate a count matrix, and from this step the data was processed in the same way as described above, with the following exceptions. We required peaks to have fragments in 1.5% of cells instead of 2% in the dimensionality reduction step. During batch integration, the embryo data was treated as another batch. For learning labels from the embryo data, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> on batch-integrated principal components to classify embryo cells using the e1071 R package. 60% of embryo cells were used as training data. 20% were used to tune the ‘gamma’ parameter in the ‘svm’ function, which was eventually set at 1e-4. The remaining 20% of embryo cells were used to test accuracy. The SVM reached an accuracy of 97.3% on this 20% of hold-out cells. Naturally, this accuracy reflects the performance on cells from the same dataset, and we can’t know how well this performance translates to our gastruloids data across datasets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Morphological analysis</title><p id="P40">The morphology of gastruloids and the spatial distribution of fluorescently labelled cells were measured with the Axios Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss). For the morphological scoring, wide field gastruloid pictures were scored blindly, and used to divide the gastruloids into ovoid, elongated and multipolar based on their morphology. For the ΔCDX gastruloids experiments, the axis ratio was measured using Fiji <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. To quantify the spatial distribution of the fluorescence signal along the anterior-posterior axis of the gastruloids, Fiji was used to draw a line from the anterior to the posterior end in order to measure the mean intensity of EGFP or mCherry along the axis.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Immunofluorescent confocal staining and analysis</title><p id="P41">The staining of the gastruloids was performed as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. After 30min fixation, 4% formaldehyde was washed away with PBS and gastruloids were blocked with PBS-FT, which consists of 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% Triton-X100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, gastruloids were stained with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS-FT: 1:100 goat-anti-SOX2 (Biotechne), 1:500 rabbit-anti-FOXC1 (Abcam) or 1:250 goat-anti-BRA (Biotechne), 1:100 rabbit anti-CDX2 (Cell Signalling Technology). Gastruloids were incubated at 4ºC overnight. After the incubation, gastruloids were washed with PBS-FT three times. For the secondary antibodies staining, 1:250 donkey-anti-rabbit 405 (ThermoFisher), 1:250 Donkey-anti-goat 488 (ThermoFisher), 1:250 Donkey-anti-rabbit 594 (Jackson) or 1:500 donkey-anti-goat 647 (Abcam) were added to the gastruloids together with 3μM DAPI where indicated and incubated at 4ºC overnight. Finally, the secondary antibodies were washed three times and the gastruloids were mounted in the microscope slides using FluorSafe (Sigma Aldrich). Confocal imaging was performed using the SP5 confocal microscope (Leica). For the ΔCDX and ΔMSGN1 gastruloid experiments, one confocal plane per gastruloid was imaged, while for the experiments including the chimeric gastruloids 3 subsequent confocal planes were imaged and averaged in the analysis. To investigate the spatial distribution of the different cell types or staining along the gastruloid, Fiji was used to segment the positive areas and measure the intensity and area in all the channels.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P42">For the image quantification analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156607-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d98aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank members of the de Wit laboratory for critically reading the manuscript.
