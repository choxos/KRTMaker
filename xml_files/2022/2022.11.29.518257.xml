This function allows ERAAP to regulate the nature and quality of the peptide repertoire and, accordingly, the resulting immune responses. We recently showed that infection with murine cytomegalovirus leads to a dramatic loss of ERAAP levels in infected cells. In mice, this loss is associated with the activation of QFL T-cells, a subset of T-cells that monitor ERAAP integrity and eliminate cells experiencing ERAAP dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to identify host factors that regulate ERAAP expression level and determine whether these could be manipulated during viral infections. We performed a CRISPR knockout screen and identified ERp44 as a factor promoting ERAAP retention in the ER. ERp44’s interaction with ERAAP is dependent on the pH gradient between the ER and Golgi. We hypothesized that viruses that disrupt the pH of the secretory pathway interfere with ERAAP retention. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the Envelope (E) protein from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to Golgi pH neutralization and consequently decrease of ERAAP intracellular levels. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced ERAAP loss correlates with its release into the extracellular environment. ERAAP’s reliance on ERp44 and a functioning ER/Golgi pH gradient for proper localization and function led us to propose that ERAAP serves as a sensor of disturbances in the secretory pathway during infection and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The antigen presentation pathway (APP) provides a snapshot of the intracellular environment to surveying immune cells in the form of peptides presented on major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This pathway plays a crucial role in the response against viruses and cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Presentation of foreign peptides (e.g. from viruses) or altered self-peptides (e.g. cancer) presented on MHC-I molecules allows cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells to recognize and kill infected or cancerous cells, respectively. In this pathway, peptide precursors are generated in the cytoplasm by the proteasome and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Once in the ER, peptides are edited to properly fit into MHC-I molecules. This function is accomplished by the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP) in mice and ER aminopeptidase (ERAP) 1 and 2 in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We will refer to these collectively as ERAP. ERAP belongs to the M1 family of metallopeptidases, and it trims peptides on their amino (N-) terminus to an approximate length of 8-10 amino acids. ERAP regulates the quality and nature of the peptide repertoire and therefore shapes the resulting immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Loss of ERAAP leads to an altered peptide repertoire characterized by changes in the abundance and length of peptide precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The peptidome of ERAAP deficient cells is sufficiently different from normal cells that these MHC-I:peptide complexes can elicit an immune response. Indeed, mice immunized with ERAAP KO cells mount a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response that results in the elimination of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Careful analysis of the responding CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells revealed that most of them recognize <underline>FL</underline>9, a self-peptide derived from the ubiquitously expressed host proteins Fam49A and B, that is presented by the non-classical MHC-I molecule, <underline>Q</underline>a1b. As a result, these cells were named QFL T-cells. Upon recognition of the FL9:Qa1b complex, QFL T-cells can kill target cells and produce inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. So far, FL9 presentation has only been reported in cells experiencing ERAAP dysfunction and thus, it has been suggested that QFL T-cells serve to monitor ERAAP function and eliminate defective cells.</p><p id="P5">Due to the central role of the APP in eliciting antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, many viruses have evolved to disrupt different components of this pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, including ERAP. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes two micro RNAs, miR-UL112-5p and miR-US4-1, that target ERAP1 for degradation and this reduces the production of HCMV antigenic peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Recently, our group showed that infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) also results in ERAAP downregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, loss of ERAAP during MCMV infection triggers a QFL T-cell response. In MCMV-infected mice, QFLs proliferate, produce inflammatory cytokines, and contribute to viral restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In naïve mice, QFL T-cells have an antigen experienced phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>suggesting that actively surveying ERAAP dysfunction, and by extension the integrity of the APP, is an important aspect of immune surveillance. A human QFL T-cell equivalent has not been identified.</p><p id="P6">Given the significance of ERAAP’s function and the consequences of its loss, we became interested in the cellular pathways that regulate ERAAP in normal cells and whether those could be disrupted during viral infection. Here we show that ERp44 promotes ERAAP retention in the ER, a process regulated by the pH of the ER and Golgi. We demonstrate that the Envelope (E) protein from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) increases the Golgi pH, leading to a decrease in ERAAP intracellular protein levels and its release into the extracellular environment. Because E’s ability to modulate ion gradients is part of SARS-CoV-2’s life cycle and pathogenesis, we propose that ERAAP could serve as an indicator of the integrity of the secretory pathway, and its loss and/or secretion could signal an altered cellular state like a viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ERAAP dsRed is expressed and properly localized to the ER</title><p id="P7">Our lab recently described that cells infected with MCMV express low levels of ERAAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Through this work, we became interested in identifying the cellular pathways that regulate ERAAP protein levels in cells under normal conditions and determine whether these pathways could be targeted during viral infection. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen to identify host factors that regulate ERAAP levels in cells. To this end, a reporter cell line that expresses an ERAAP-dsRed fusion protein was generated to allow monitoring of ERAAP levels by flow cytometry. Human Burkitt lymphoma B (BJAB) cells were transduced to express ERAAP-dsRed and subsequently two cell clones (B2 and D4) that possessed homogenous, stable, and high expression of ERAAP-dsRed were isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To confirm the proper ER localization of the ERAAP-dsRed construct, an Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) assay was performed. Glycans added to proteins in the ER are further modified as they transit through the Golgi. These modifications change the sensitivity of the glycan structure to cleavage by enzymes like Endo H. Thus, Endo H sensitivity can be used as an indicator of the general localization within the secretory pathway. ERAAP resides in the ER and should remain sensitive to Endo H cleavage. Indeed, ERAAP-dsRed shows sensitivity to Endo H cleavage as evidenced by the appearance of a lower molecular weight band (shift from ~150 kDa to 130 kDa) in samples treated with the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) in comparison to untreated samples. Endogenous ERAP was also detected in this gel (~100 kDa) and remained Endo H sensitive suggesting ERAAP-dsRed expression does not interfere with the localization of the endogenous protein. Since both cell clones showed high expression of ERAAP-dsRed and proper ER localization, we selected clone B2 to perform our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ERp44 regulates ERAAP levels</title><p id="P9">To perform the genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, BJAB ERAAP dsRed cells (clone B2) were transduced to express Cas9. These cells were then transduced with the human genome-scale CRISPR KO (GeCKO) v2 library targeting over 19,000 genes (containing 6 guide RNAs (gRNAs) per gene). After selection and recovery, cells with the top and bottom 10-15% dsRed signal were sorted and the gRNAs, present in these cell populations, were identified by sequencing and compared for gene enrichment.</p><p id="P10">From our hits, ERp44 stood out for its role in modulating the localization and trafficking of different host proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Other potential hits obtained from the gRNA library screen mostly corresponded to proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Because of the high likelihood that these factors control ERAAP dsRed transcription from the CMV promoter of our retroviral construct, we decided to only focus on ERp44 in this study.</p><p id="P11">ERp44’s interaction with ERAP has been reported to regulate ERAP localization by retrieving it from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/cis-Golgi and bringing it back into the ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To confirm the results of our screen, BJAB ERAAP dsRed cells were transduced with a gRNA targeting ERp44. As expected, cells lacking ERp44 showed a marked decrease in ERAAP protein levels as observed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Knockout of ERAAP did not affect ERp44 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To test if ERAAP was being secreted from BJAB cells lacking ERp44, ERAAP was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant and ERAAP activity was quantified using the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As predicted, ERp44 KO cells secreted ERAAP as evidenced by increased LAP activity in comparison to parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). ERp44 controls ERAAP retention across a variety of cell lines, both mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>) and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggesting ERp44’s regulation of ERAP is a conserved feature of mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SARS-CoV-2 Envelope neutralizes the pH of the Golgi</title><p id="P13">One of the factors regulating ERp44’s function is pH. Dysregulation of the Golgi pH abrogates the ability of ERp44 to interact with its clients and results in their secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We reasoned that interfering with the pH homeostasis of the Golgi could have negative consequences for ERAAP function. Interestingly, some viruses encode proteins that modify the pH of intracellular compartments as part of their viral life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In particular, the E proteins from the coronaviruses Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to increase the pH of the Golgi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Neutralization of the Golgi space is thought to protect the fusion protein Spike (S) from abnormal cleavage by Golgi resident proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

Viruses lacking E are attenuated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>and E’s ion channel-like activity seems to be particularly important for pathogenesis and SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Still, much remains to be known about E’s intracellular function and impact on cellular pathways.</p><p id="P14">We hypothesized that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, E-mediated neutralization of the Golgi and the subsequent loss of ERp44 activity might result in ERAP being secreted rather than being retained into the ER. We decided to first confirm that the expression of SARS-CoV-2 E in cells indeed causes an increase in the pH of the Golgi as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. To that extent, we used the pH reporter pHluorin-TGN38, a Golgi-localized GFP variant that exhibits bimodal excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The fluorescence emission from this reporter changes in response to pH. Specifically, the emission ratio of pHluorin (405 nm/488 nm) increases as pH increases. HeLa cells co-transfected with SARS-CoV-2 E showed a higher pHluorin emission ratio in comparison to cells transfected only with the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using HeLa cells transfected with the reporter and resuspended in buffers of known pH, we generated a standard curve to convert pHluorin emission ratios to pH values. As expected, cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E showed neutralization of the Golgi in comparison to control cells. In control cells, the pH of the Golgi was 6.9 and increased to 7.4 in cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E. As an additional control, we transfected cells with Influenza A virus (IAV) M2, a viral protein known to increase the Golgi pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and observed an increased pHluorin emission ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) that translated to a Golgi pH of 7.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 E behaves as previously demonstrated by neutralizing the pH of the Golgi.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>SARS-CoV-2 Envelope leads to decreased ERAAP levels</title><p id="P15">Next, we asked if SARS-CoV-2 E expression could result in a reduction in ERAAP’s intracellular levels. To evaluate ERAAP levels specifically in cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E, we decided to use a co-transfection system. HEK293T cells were chosen as they are easily transfectable, and they express low levels of ERAP endogenously. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with a vector encoding ERAAP-dsRed and another vector encoding GFP and SARS-CoV-2 E (or a vector expressing only GFP as control). 24- and 48-hours post-transfection (hpt), cells were harvested and ERAAP dsRed levels were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E showed decreased ERAAP-dsRed levels in comparison to vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on the dsRed geometric mean fluorescence for each population, we found that cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E have ~40-50% of the levels of ERAAP in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The effect of SARS-CoV-2 E on ERAAP protein levels was also confirmed using an alternative method. Cells were co-transfected with a vector encoding a Flag-tagged ERAAP and a vector encoding SARS-CoV-2 E or an empty vector control. 36 hpt, whole cell lysate (WCL) was collected and ERAAP protein levels were evaluated by western blot. As observed before, cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E have decreased levels of ERAAP. Importantly, this effect is specific to SARS-CoV-2 E as co-transfecting a different viral protein, SARS-CoV-2 S, did not decrease ERAAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysis of ERAAP levels across multiple experiments revealed that cells expressing E have on average ~60% the levels of ERAAP (40% reduction) of cells co-transfected with the empty vector. Cells co-transfected with an unrelated protein did not show any decrease in ERAAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 E causes a loss in ERAAP levels likely as a result of disrupting ERp44-mediated recycling of ERAAP.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ERAAP is secreted from cells expressing SARS CoV-2 Envelope</title><p id="P17">We hypothesized that the loss in ERAAP levels observed in cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E might be the result of ERAAP release into the supernatant as described with cells lacking ERp44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To test this, the supernatant of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing ERAAP dsRed and transfected with SARS-CoV-2 E (or empty vector as control) was collected at 48 hpt and a LAP assay was performed.</p><p id="P18">In cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E, we observed ~34% ERAAP secretion relative to ERp44 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cells co-transfected with empty vector showed ~13% ERAAP release. This background level of ERAAP secretion is likely due to overexpression of ERAAP in this system which might saturate retention mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Still, SARS-CoV-2 E induces a significant 2.7-fold increase in ERAAP secretion relative to empty vector control. Importantly the amount of ERAAP being secreted by SARS-CoV-2 E-expressing cells is probably largely underestimated in this assay since only ~20-30% of the cells are transfected with SARS-CoV-2 E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Together our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 E disrupts ERAAP function by preventing the efficient retention of ERAAP inside cells and leading to its secretion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Using a CRISPR KO screen, we identified ERp44 as the main host factor regulating ERAAP retention in cells. ERp44 KO cells showed decreased intracellular ERAAP levels and increased secretion of ERAAP into the extracellular environment. ERp44-mediated retention of ERAAP is in part regulated by pH. Here we report that pH disruption by SARS-CoV-2 E interferes with ERAAP retention in the ER and leads to its secretion. The increase of Golgi pH by E is an important part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle as it protects the S protein from being inadequately processed by proteases residing in the Golgi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">To avoid detection by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, viruses have evolved a myriad of immune evasion mechanisms aimed at preventing the presentation of antigenic peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Interfering with ERAAP likely represents another one of these strategies as illustrated by HCMV, and likely MCMV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a recent study by Stamatakis, et al., showed that ERAP generates potentially immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 S-derived peptides predicted to bind MHC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E leads to a decrease in ERAP intracellular concentration. This suggests that targeting of the Golgi by SARS-CoV-2 could function to both preserve the integrity of the viral fusion protein S and dampen the generation of virally-derived antigenic peptides through the loss of ERAP. Given the central role of ERAP in modulating T-cell responses, other viruses beyond HCMV, MCMV, and SARS-CoV-2 may have also evolved to disrupt ERAP as part of their immune evasion strategies.</p><p id="P21">Fortunately, viral immune evasion does not go unchallenged. Cells and the immune system have evolved mechanisms to sense and respond to virally-mediated disturbances. In mice, ERAAP dysfunction is sensed by QFL T-cells. MCMV-induced ERAAP loss results in the presentation of the self-peptide FL9 in the MHC-I molecule Qa1b, the activating ligand of QFL T-cells. In infected mice, QFL T-cells are activated, produce inflammatory cytokines, and can kill cells experiencing ERAAP loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This exciting observation suggests that ERAAP dysregulation during infection has the potential to be sensed by the immune system. The existence of QFL-like T-cells in humans has yet to be described, but it is tempting to speculate that if a similar immune response exists, it could aid in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P22">In addition to the loss of intracellular ERAP, we showed that ERAP is secreted from cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 E. Secreted ERAP has been implicated in blood pressure regulation which might have consequences for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ERAP’s potential to modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which controls blood pressure, comes from its ability to cleave Angiotensin II (Ang II) into Ang III and Ang IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Ang II exerts its effects on multiple organs that work in concert to raise blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To maintain normotension, Ang II levels are carefully regulated. Ang II is cleaved into other angiotensin products that can activate parallel pathways which have the opposite effect of lowering blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Ang II is normally cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 has gathered much attention as it is the main receptor SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Upon interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S with ACE2, the virus is internalized causing a temporary depletion of ACE2 at the cell surface, which can result in local increases of Ang II levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Dysregulated RAAS is thought to contribute to the clinical manifestations of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. As recently proposed by D’Amico et al., secreted ERAP could help alleviate some of these effects by lowering the levels of Ang II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Our findings provide the first indication that ERAP can be secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells opening the possibility that ERAP might regulate RAAS during infection. Future studies are needed to address the specific contribution of ERAP as a potential protective factor during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, some ERAP polymorphisms predicted to result in lower ERAP activity or loss of function, have been linked to hypertension and blood pressure progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. It is possible that patients with dysfunctional ERAP could be susceptible to more detrimental COVID-19 outcomes because of an inability to dampen Ang II levels. One described ERAP polymorphism, A1533G, results in reduced activity and inability to convert Ang II into its cleavage products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Given these observations, it is certain that the role of ERAP in SARS-CoV-2 infection merits more investigation due to the potential of ERAP to protect or contribute to COVID-19 pathology.</p><p id="P23">As shown here by us and others, ERAAP localization and retention are regulated by the chaperone ERp44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. ERp44 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family that cycles between the ER, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi. ERp44 interacts with client proteins, such as ERAP, that lack ER retention motifs (i.e. KDEL) and retrieves them from the Golgi back into the ER. Importantly, ERp44’s function is regulated by pH. In the neutral environment of the ER, ERp44 adopts a close conformation in which its carboxyl (C-) terminal tail occludes the client binding site. In the acidic environment of the ERGIC and cis-Golgi, ERp44 undergoes conformational changes that liberate its C-terminal tail and makes its binding pocket accessible for client binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The C-terminus of ERp44 contains an RDEL sequence that facilitates the transport of the ERp44-client complex from the Golgi to the ER via KDEL receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Similar to what we reported here, increasing the Golgi pH by silencing the Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) results in a decreased ability of ERp44 to bind its clients, and secretion of clients to the extracellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition to ERAP, ERp44 is involved in regulating other clients including Ero1β, Prx4, and SUMF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Secretion of these clients has been reported in cases where interactions with ERp44 are perturbed and so we speculate that these may be also secreted by SARS-CoV-2 E-expressing cells. Whether these other clients have extracellular functions, and whether their secretion is physiologically relevant remains to be explored.</p><p id="P24">The observation that pH dysregulation leads to ERAAP loss potentially extends beyond SARS-CoV-2. The E protein belongs to a larger family of virally encoded ion channel-like proteins collectively known as viroporins. Due to their ability to change membrane permeability, viroporins induce a range of physiological changes in the cell and are encoded by viruses across many different families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> including some that are clinically relevant like IAV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Of all viroporins, the best studied is IAV M2. M2 is a multifunctional pH-regulated ion channel and similar to SARS-CoV-2 E, M2 localizes to the Golgi membranes where it neutralizes the pH of this organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. For M2, the ability to modulate Golgi pH helps protect hemagglutinin from preemptively adopting the low pH conformation needed for fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The p7 protein from HCV has also been shown to disrupt H<sup>+</sup> gradients and increase intracellular pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. It would be interesting to test whether infection with viruses like IAV and HCV could also result in ERAP loss and secretion.</p><p id="P25">Given that ERAP’s main function is peptide trimming in the ER, it is interesting that this protein lacks an ER retention signal and instead relies on ERp44 for its proper localization and function. This reliance on ERp44 makes ERAP susceptible to different modes of regulation. Indeed, in addition to pH perturbation, ERp44 function is abrogated by disruption of the oxidoreductive state in the ER/Golgi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, changes in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> gradient of the secretory pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, as well as altered trafficking between the Golgi and the ER. This reliance on pH, redox, or Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis for ERp44 function thus suggests that perturbation of these elements, whether they are mediated by a disease state or an infection, should lead to loss of ERAP. Since the loss of ERAP is associated with the presentation of an alternative immunogenic peptide repertoire on MHC-I molecules, it is expected that perturbation of these pathways would lead to the elimination of the affected cells by the immune system. Notably, because viruses rely on co-opting the secretory pathway to produce viral proteins and the assembly of virions, one can reason that it will be difficult for viruses to evade activating pathways that sense perturbations in these compartments. Taken together, we propose that ERAP could serve as a sensor of intracellular disturbances and a link between cellular sensing and activation of the immune system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P26">HEK293T, HeLa cells, and Phoenix cells were obtained from the UC Berkeley Cell Culture Facility.

To test for proper ERAAP dsRed localization, Endo H assay was performed. WCL was collected from BJAB ERAAP dsRed clones B2 and D4 and ERAAP was immunoprecipitated using an anti-ERAAP antibody. Purified ERAAP was incubated with Endo H enzyme (Endo H +) or water (Endo H -) as a control. After treatment, ERAAP’s molecular weight was determined by western blot. Shown is a representative ERAAP blot. In non-treated samples, ERAAP dsRed appears as a ~150 kDa band (top set of arrows) while endogenous ERAP (WT ERAP; bottom set of arrows) can be observed as a ~100 kDa band.
