This research aimed to develop a molecular pathway model to understand the B cell development in COVID-19. A B cell transcriptomics dataset, obtained from COVID-19 patients, was analyzed on the resulting pathway model to study B cell activation. The pathway showed two distinct gene expression profiles between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, there is an increase in transcript levels of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes such as ISG15, IFITM1, and NEAT1 and a driving gene for the extrafollicular pathway CXCR4 indicating a formation of plasmablast. In symptomatic patients, the results suggest an inhibition occurring at the germinal center hinting at a reduction in memory B cell production. Transcripts of driver gene CXCR5 involved in germinal center development is one of the most downregulated genes. This could contribute to the shortage in the formation of memory B cells in COVID-19. Concluding, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, B cells follow different activation routes in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. In this study, we constructed a pathway that allowed us to analyze and interpret activation patterns of B cells in COVID-19 patients and their link to disease severity. Importantly, the pathway and approach can be reused for further research in COVID-19 or other diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>molecular pathway</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Recent COVID-19 studies showed a correlation between delayed and weak adaptive immune responses with poor clinical outcomes in severe patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Part of adaptive immunity is the humoral response has been shown to be delayed in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In the humoral immune response, B cells are essential for presenting antigens to other immune cells, producing pathogen-specific antibodies, and secreting proinflammatory cytokines. Low B cell counts of some subsets such as memory B cells and expression of B cells related genes such as heavy chain and light V chain genes are observed in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">B cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, where they differentiate into immature B cells. These immature B cells then migrate via the blood to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen or the lymph nodes, to complete maturation. Upon infection or immunization as a response to an invading pathogen, the circulating mature but naïve B cells are activated through antigen encounter and may follow one of two pathways to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. They may either develop along canonical responses involving germinal center reaction, where they can differentiate into long-lived B cell populations, namely memory B cells, and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Alternatively, B cells may participate in non-canonical responses that lack GCs and cooperate in B cell proliferation and differentiation into short-lived plasmablasts at extrafollicular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Both pathways ultimately lead to the production and secretion of antibodies in the form of antibody-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this study, we aim to create a molecular pathway model of B cell activation in COVID-19 to comprehend the transformation of B cells into different subsets through different differentiation routes.

A literature review was done initially, to collect all relevant information. Besides studies on B cell activation in relation to SARS-CoV-2, generalized research on B cell activation in response to infection was also used. As a starting point, the pathway was built based on a diagram that depicts the migration of B cells from the outer lymph node into the follicle upon activation from Cerutti et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The pathway model was then constructed using an open-source pathway analysis and drawing software PathVisio version 3.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Gene products and proteins were annotated with identifiers from Ensembl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Literature references were added to specific sections and interactions in the pathway.

The dataset included RNAseq data from three different B cell types: immature, naive, and exhausted B cells. Only data for naive and exhausted B cells were used in this study because our pathway model focuses on the activation of B cells after the immature stage. Differentially expressed genes were identified as those with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Expression values of these genes were then projected and visualized on the pathway model using Cytoscape version 3.9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and the WikiPathways app version 3.3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><label>3.1</label><title>B cell activation in COVID-19: pathway description</title><p id="P7">To study the B cell development during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a machine-readable molecular pathway model based on 25 papers of which five are COVID-19 specific. The final pathway model depicts the initial B cell activation inside the lymph node and the following activation routes to differentiate to either plasmablast cells following the extrafollicular pathway or memory B cells through the follicular pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The pathway was deposited in WikiPathways under the identifier WP5218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><sec id="S7"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Initial B cell activation and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, blue box)</title><p id="P8">Initially, in the lymph node, naive B cells can interact with either macrophages or dendritic cells that carry SARS-CoV-2 antigens (N and S proteins) on their surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Via its IgM and IgG receptors, the B cell receives activation signals to process the antigen and subsequently migrate to the T-B border of the lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). A balanced expression of CCR7 and CXCR5 mediates B cells to migrate to the interface between follicles and T-cell areas (T-B border zone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). At the T-B border, the B cell displays a peptide MHC-II antigenic complex, through which it can interact with the pre-T-cell antigen receptor alpha of an early state T follicular helper (TFH) cell. Through its CD40L receptor, the TFH cell can bind to the CD40 receptor of the B cell. Furthermore, the TFH cell secretes the cytokines IL21, IL4, and IFN<italic>γ</italic>, all of which stimulate the development of the B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). When the B cell gets activated, EBI2 expression is greatly increased. EBI2 is necessary for the localization of the B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Downregulation of EBI2 indicates GC differentiation whereas the persistence of the EBI2 receptor suggests the integration of the activated B cell into the extrafollicular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Apart from this, the factors IRF4 and IRF8 are also involved in B cell guidance. High concentrations of IRF4 as a consequence of B cell activation drive the rapid generation of plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Besides facilitating antigen-specific interaction with T helper cells, IRF8 in contrast promotes GC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Following the interaction with the TFH cell, the B cell may enter either the canonical (follicular) or extrafollicular pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Canonical/ follicular pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, green box)</title><p id="P9">For the B cell to follow the canonical pathway and travel inside the follicle, it has to upregulate the expression of CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This is stimulated by the chemokine CXCL13, which also excites the movement of TFH cells toward the follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). CXCL13 itself is expressed by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). FDCs are a major reservoir for antigens and play a crucial role in the formation of germinal centers (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The FDC also expresses BAFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), IL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), IL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and APRIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), all of which modulate B cell differentiation within the GC. In the second step, the CD40 receptor of the B cell will undergo a cognate interaction with the CD40L receptor of the TFH cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Furthermore, the CD40 receptor can stimulate the expression of ICOSL, which then promotes the formation of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Consequently, the B cell may undergo Class Switch Recombination and affinity maturation through Somatic Hypermutation, ultimately leading to the diversification of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Upon encounter with their cognate antigen, B cells rapidly upregulate CD69 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Amongst others, GC B cells can be recognized by their expression of BCL6, which inhibits the differentiation towards plasmablasts by repressing BLIMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). BLIMP1 in turn suppresses PAX5, which acts as a dual function activator and suppressor and is essential for GC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). For instance, PAX5 represses XBP1, involved in plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Along with BACH2 and BCL6, PAX5 stabilizes the GC B cell state, while antagonizing plasma cell differentiation. Following GC formation, B cells may either develop into long-lived memory B cells or into plasma cells that primarily produce IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), depicted in the lower corner on the right side of the pathway model. In case the B cell differentiates into an IgM or IgG antibody producing memory B cell, the factors EBI3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), IGHV4-34, IFIT2, ISG15, CD80, CD82, and CR1 will be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>3.1.3</label><title>Extrafollicular pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, pink box)</title><p id="P10">While CXCR5 is an indicator of B cell maturation towards the GC, an increased expression of CXCR4 may in turn portend toward an extrafollicular pathway entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Differentiation of the B cell following the non-canonical pathway ultimately leads to the generation of short-lived plasmablasts that secrete IgM. This process is stimulated by IL4, BAFF, IL12, and IL6, which are produced by innate immune cells and all promote B cell activation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Hence, dysregulation of B cells may therefore be caused by the innate immune response. Downregulation of CXCR5 and CCR7 then direct plasmablast migration towards extrafollicular growth by decreasing their responsiveness to the follicular and T zone chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The resulting plasmablast populations express the PAX5 repressed gene TMSB10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), as well as the genes XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), NEAT1, MS4A1, HSPA8, PTPRC, IFITM1, ISG15, and IFNG-AS1, that indicate an ongoing interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Particularly, ISG15-secreting plasmablasts are a proinflammatory feature in autoimmune diseases like SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Plasmablasts can differentiate into plasma cells via the association of CD11c high dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Alternatively, to directly develop into a plasmablast via the extrafollicular pathway, B cells may also develop into double negative type 2 (DN2) B cells, which are closely related to activated naïve B cells and are prone to differentiate into plasma cells. DN2 B cells may undergo class switching, however, they lack IgD and CD27 expression. They are a unique type of memory B cells that are expanded in a variety of diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases, and are known to contribute to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The formation of DN2 B cells is indicated by several markers, including FCRL5, SLAMF7, CD22, PD1, TBET, ZEB2, and CD19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Furthermore, DN2 B cells express low amounts of ETS1 gene which may inhibit plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). When ETS1 is deficient, this may cause an extrafollicular accumulation of autoreactive plasma cells. On the other hand, TLR7 and IL21 stimulate DN2 B cell maturation into plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Besides, TLR7 may also enhance IgG antibody production but is also involved in causing the production of autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>3.1.4</label><title>Other cells and interactions involved in B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, yellow box)</title><p id="P12">Although the main focus of this pathway is the B cell development into antibody secreting cells, other cells also play an important role in guiding the B cell toward maturation. For instance, before the T cell is equipped with B cell helper activity, it needs to be activated by a dendritic cell. The early T cell resides in the extrafollicular area of the lymph node, depicted in the upper left corner of the model. The dendritic cell itself expresses high amounts of CD11c and is stimulated by TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Regulation of humoral immunity toward short-lived extrafollicular responses occurs via the expression of IL12, which is known to inhibit TFH differentiation strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Other factors inhibiting TFH cell development include IFN<italic>γ</italic>, Il21, IL2, and TNF<italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). While TBX21 suppresses GC responses, IL6 indirectly promotes GC formation through the stimulation of TFH differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The activated T cell may further migrate to the T-B border.</p><p id="P13">The top right corner of the pathway resembles the interaction between an invariant natural killer T cell (iNKT cell) with a B cell.

The iNKT cell also promotes the cognate interaction of the dendritic cell with the T cell, which may then differentiate into a TFH cell.

This upregulation could indicate that asymptomatic patients quickly recognized and responded to the virus with the help of plasmablast cells in the extrafollicular pathway. A recent study by Hinai et al. (2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) has shown that an increase in the expression of interferon stimulated genes reduces the viral copies of influenza A virus in vitro. The upregulation in interferon stimulated genes in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was also found in other studies and was correlated with good clinical outcomes in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). The upregulation in the formation of plasmablast and no change in essential genes for germinal center formation in asymptomatic patients from our study support the hypothesis that asymptomatic patients have a quick and effective innate immune response to control viral replication which helps to prevent a severe clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In symptomatic patients, the data visualized in the pathway shows upregulation of genes in the extrafollicular area indicating plasmablast formation but also downregulation in genes in the follicular area indicating a lack of canonical pathway activation or germinal center activation. Especially, the more severe the disease the more reduction in gene expression in the follicular area. These findings are consistent with previous findings in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We furthermore found that CXCR5, a key regulator of follicular pathway activation, indicating follicle entry of B cells, is downregulated in all cell types and severity levels in symptomatic patients, especially in severe and critical cases. This indicates that the B cell maturation in these patients is guided towards the extrafollicular pathway.

With the current pathway model, the same research could be done quickly for other diseases and for the comparison of different disease signatures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS158792-supplement-Supplementary_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d39aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Funding statement</title><p>The project is funded by the ZonMw COVID-19 programme (Grant No. 10430012010015).</p></ack><sec id="S18" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="P26">The pathway model constructed from this study can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP5218">www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP5218</ext-link>.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P27"><bold>Conflict of interest disclosure</bold></p><p id="P28">The authors declare no commercial or financial conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn id="FN2"><p id="P29"><bold>Ethics approval statement: human and animal studies</bold></p><p id="P30">Not relevant</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P31"><bold>Patient consent statement</bold></p><p id="P32">Not relevant</p></fn><fn id="FN4"><p id="P33"><bold>Permission to reproduce material from other sources</bold></p><p id="P34">Not relevant</p></fn><fn id="FN5"><p id="P35"><bold>Clinical trial registration</bold></p><p id="P36">Not relevant</p></fn><fn id="FN6" fn-type="con"><p id="P37"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P38">NP, NT and MK conceived the idea.
