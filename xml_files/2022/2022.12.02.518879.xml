To achieve this, the capsid protein, CA, constructs conical capsids from a lattice of hexamers and pentamers, and engages in and then relinquishes multiple interactions with cellular proteins in an orchestrated fashion. Cellular host factors including Nup153, CPSF6 and Sec24C engage the same pocket within CA hexamers. How CA assembles pentamers and hexamers of different curvatures, how CA oligomerization states or curvature might modulate host-protein interactions, and how binding of multiple co-factors to a single site is coordinated, all remain to be elucidated. Here, we have resolved the structure of the mature HIV-1 CA pentamer and hexamer from conical CA-IP<sub>6</sub> polyhedra to high resolution. We have determined structures of hexamers in the context of multiple lattice curvatures and number of pentamer contacts. Comparison of these structures, bound or not to host protein peptides, revealed two structural switches within HIV-1 CA that modulate peptide binding according to CA lattice curvature and whether CA is hexameric or pentameric. These observations suggest that the conical HIV-1 capsid has different host-protein binding properties at different positions on its surface, which may facilitate cell entry and represent an evolutionary advantage of conical morphology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The mature HIV-1 capsid is a conical, fullerene shell that encompasses the viral genome. It is constructed of a lattice of approximately 200 capsid protein (CA) hexamers incorporating CA pentamers at 12 highly curved vertices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The capsid serves multiple functions during viral infection. As the vessel in which reverse transcription takes place, it regulates access of cellular dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) whilst simultaneously shielding its genetic cargo from detection and degradation by host cellular immunity systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The surface of the conical capsid is dense in protein binding sites that mediate interactions with host machinery necessary for transport of the capsid through the cytoplasm into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">CA monomers consist of two alpha-helical domains. The CA N-terminal domain (CA<sub>NTD</sub>), situated on the outer surface of the capsid, stabilises the hexamer via interactions around a six-fold axis. The C-terminal domain (CA<sub>CTD</sub>) engages in the dimeric and trimeric interactions that join hexamers together into a lattice. The small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) is known to act as an assembly factor for both immature and mature HIV-1 CA lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In the mature lattice, IP<sub>6</sub> coordinates R18 in the central CA<sub>NTD</sub> pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), where it greatly increases capsid stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Flexibility in the linker between the two CA domains and in the interactions between domains have been proposed to provide plasticity necessary to allow the hexamer to construct different lattice curvatures at different positions on the conical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and may also permit formation of both pentamers and hexamers of CA. The precise stability, or instability, of the capsid is critical for correct function. Accordingly, mutations that hyper-stabilise or destabilise the capsid both lead to marked reductions in infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), implying that the capsid must retain sufficient stability to maintain a protective function, but also uncoat readily enough at the correct moment.</p><p id="P6">Low-resolution structures of CA hexamers from capsid cores within HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) have validated that high-resolution crystal structures of HIV-1 CA hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) are representative of hexamers in the virion. In contrast, low-resolution structures of the CA pentamer within virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) are not consistent with available crystal structures of crosslinked, mutant CA pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and the high-resolution structure of the “in virus” pentamer remains unknown.</p><p id="P7">Two protein binding sites on the surface of the core have been characterised structurally by way of cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography. The CypA binding loop constitutes a flexible span of residues between helices 4 and 5, and binds cyclophillinA (CypA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and nuclear pore component Nup358, which contains a CypA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). A second binding site within the CA<sub>NTD</sub> specifically binds phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). FG-repeat-containing host factors are diverse in their cellular distribution and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and include: Nup153, a nuclear pore complex component; Sec24c, a member of the COPII complex implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking; and the nuclear-localised CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). All three proteins insert an FG motif into a pocket between helices 3 and 4 of the CA<sub>NTD</sub>, while residues proximal to the FG repeat bind to CA residues in a cleft formed between the CA<sub>NTD</sub> and the CA<sub>CTD</sub> of the neighbouring CA in the hexamer. Subtle differences in binding affinity between different FG repeats as a result of varying binding conformation may play an important role in transport and nuclear import of the capsid. Accordingly, quantitative fluorescence microscopy of reverse transcription and pre-integration complexes suggest that there is a hand-off from Nup153 at the nuclear pore to CPSF6 within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Owing to its critical role in orchestrating early phase replication, the FG-binding site has been the target of concerted efforts to identify CA targeting antiretrovirals. Such studies have led to potent drug candidates including PF-3540074 (PF74) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and members of the GS-CA family including lenacapavir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). A difference in the relative orientations of the CA<sub>NTD</sub> and the CA<sub>CTD</sub> between hexamers and pentamers in <italic>in situ</italic> structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) alters the apparent accessibility of the FG repeat binding site, but in the absence of high-resolution structures of the viral CA pentamer the implications for host-protein binding to the pentamer are not clear. It is also not clear whether changes in CA hexamer curvature can modulate FG-motif binding.</p><p id="P8">CA can be induced to assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> in buffers containing IP<sub>6</sub> at physiological salt concentration to form structures containing hexamers and pentamers that closely resemble authentic CA cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript). Here, we present high-resolution structures of CA hexamers and pentamers within <italic>in-vitro</italic> assembled conical CA-IP<sub>6</sub> polyhedra from multiple lattice contexts differing in local curvature and geometry, alone or in the presence of Nup153, CPSF6 or Sec24C-derived peptides. This analysis suggests that the structure and morphology of the core have evolved to preferentially bind different components of the host-cell machinery at different regions of the conical capsid surface. This is achieved using two structural switches within CA that modulate host-factor binding. The first switch alters the FG-repeat binding pocket between the hexamer and pentamer, precluding FG repeat binding to the pentamer completely. The second switch regulates Nup153 affinity to the hexamer in a manner that is sensitive to local capsid curvature.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structures of the mature HIV-1 CA pentamer and hexamer</title><p id="P9">Purified recombinant CA protein was assembled in the presence of IP<sub>6</sub> into mature core-like particles (CLPs), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The contents of the reaction mixture were used to prepare cryo-EM grids, which were imaged in the electron microscope using standard single particle data collection conditions (methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Inspection of micrographs confirmed that the size and morphology of the CLPs were qualitatively similar to capsid morphologies reported in mature viruses by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), and this was confirmed using cryo-ET (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript).</p><p id="P10">From these data we selected “particles” corresponding to arbitrary regions of the capsid surface and applied single-particle data analysis techniques including 3D-classification (Methods) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). We obtained separate reconstructions of the pentamer and of the hexamer to nominal resolutions of 2.9Å and used these to build atomic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Both structures match well to those previously determined at low-resolution within virions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), and to those independently determined in the accompanying manuscript (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript).</p><p id="P11">The relative orientation of the CA<sub>NTD</sub> and CA<sub>CTD</sub> within individual CA monomers is very similar in hexamers and pentamers, with very little change in the position of the inter-domain linker. Comparison of the pentamer and hexamer CA<sub>NTD</sub> structures revealed structural differences at the base of helix 3 and 4 and the intervening helix 3/4 loop, and includes the formation of an additional 3<sub>10</sub> helical turn at the base of helix 3 (residues 58-61) in the pentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-G</xref>). This results in V59 moving towards the core of the CA<sub>NTD</sub> helical bundle inducing a new conformation of M66. This restructures the pocket which, in the hexamer, is the binding site for FG repeat co-factors Nup153, CPSF6 and Sec24C. Based on comparison with crystal structures of FG repeat peptides bound to CA hexamers, we speculated that in the pentamer this pocket is unable to bind FG motifs. We will refer to this structural rearrangement as the ‘hexamer-pentamer switch’. These observations match and confirm those made in a preprint from the Pornillos lab (Schirra et al 2022, bioRxiv: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.25.505312">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.25.505312</ext-link>).</p><p id="P12">In the hexamer, as in the crystal structure, interactions between neighbouring CA<sub>NTD</sub>s around the symmetry axis are mediated in large part by residues P38 and M39 in helix 2 contacting residues N57 and T58 in helix 3 from the adjacent monomer. In contrast, in the pentamer, helix 2 forms an interface with helix 1 of the adjacent monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Additionally, a new interface forms between helix 1 of adjacent monomers, including a hydrogen bond between T19 and the εN of R18 that may further fix the position of the R18 ring, and a salt bridge between K30 and E29. In the hexamer, K30 is not a pore-facing residue and may interact with E28, while E29 is freely exposed to the centre of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Within the central pore of the pentamer we observe two densities, which we interpret as IP<sub>6</sub> molecules (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript): one IP<sub>6</sub> sits above, and engages with, the R18 ring, while the other is coordinated by the K25 ring in a fashion that is reminiscent of previously reported hexameric crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Within the central pore of the hexamer, we also observe two IP<sub>6</sub> densities co-ordinated by rings of R18 and K25, but density for IP<sub>6</sub> coordinated by K25 appears to be weaker than that of the pentamer suggesting lower occupancy. The spacing between K25 residues is much larger in the hexamer, and its position suggests that in the absence of IP<sub>6</sub> it could instead form an intramolecular salt bridge with the exposed E29.</p><p id="P14">The CA<sub>NTD</sub>–CA<sub>CTD</sub> interface in the hexamer is essentially identical to that previously described in hexameric CA crystals (PDB: 4XFX; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)). In the pentamer, a largely hydrophobic interface forms centered around Y169, L211 and M215 in the CA<sub>CTD</sub>, A64, M144, Y145 in the CA<sub>NTD</sub>. R173 in the CA<sub>CTD</sub>, which in the hexamer forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of N57 and V59 in the adjacent CA<sub>NTD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), instead interacts with E28 in the pentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structures of hexamers of varying curvature</title><p id="P15">To form the surface of the conical HIV-1 capsid, hexamers adapt to different local curvatures at different positions of the core surface, and in certain instances make contact with one or more pentamers. In order to study curvature and contact variation in our sample, and following the approach previously applied to cores within intact HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), we first analyzed cryo-ET/subtomogram averaging data of the assembled CLPs (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript), and calculated tilt and twist angles between all pairs of neighbouring hexamers. The distribution of our tilt-twist measurements represents a distribution of curvatures in the CLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, heatmap) and recapitulates the previous observations made in virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Additionally, through visual inspection of the hexamer-pentamer distributions revealed by cryoET we identified 4 classes of hexamer that make contact with a pentamer: hexamers contacting one (type I), two (2 forms, type II.a and II.b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and in rare cases three pentamers (type III).</p><p id="P16">To study the structures of hexamer curvature variants within our single particle dataset, we applied symmetry expansion to generate a dataset corresponding to all hexamer-hexamer pairs, and then performed 3D variability analysis. From this analysis we derived two primary variability components, which upon inspection resembled hexamer-hexamer tilt in the first class and hexamer-hexamer twist in the second class. We grouped the refined particles along these two variability components to generate nine non-overlapping classes for tilt and seven for twist, each of which was independently refined and reconstructed. Doing so allowed us to generate two series of reconstructions varying by tilt and twist, where all individual reconstructions were at resolutions between 3.1 – 3.4Å. The tilt and twist values for each reconstruction were measured from the symmetry axes of fitted models and mapped onto the distribution determined by cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, red and green points). Doing so confirmed that the two primary variability components correspond to tilt and twist and that the angular ranges represented in our reconstructions (Tilt: +6.4° - +24.1°, Twist: -10.3° - +9.1°) constitute a significant portion of the true accessible range.</p><p id="P17">Next, using reference-based classification, we identified classes of hexamer that were adjacent to pentamers within our original hexamer particle set, which we then independently refined. These yielded reconstructions of hexamers contacting a single pentamer, resolved to 3.0Å and two reconstructions of hexamers contacting two pentamers (type II.a and II.b), resolved to 3.6Å and 3.9Å respectively. We were unable to recover a class corresponding to hexamers contacting three pentamers, likely due to its rarity within our sample. To describe the geometry of hexamers adjacent to pentamers we calculated the tilt and twist of all the resolved hexamer-pentamer and hexamer-hexamer pairs. Hexamer-hexamer pairs adjacent to pentamers are highly tilted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, black, grey and white points): for example, the two symmetry-related hexamers in the type II.a reconstruction are tilted relative to one another by 45.7°.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interpretation of hexamer variant structures and interfaces</title><p id="P18">The above approach generated 19 reconstructions representing the curvature variability of capsid on the surface of the CLPs. We built models into these reconstructions and compared them with one another. All hexamers, regardless of tilt or twist, share the same structure in the ‘pentamer-hexamer switch’ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). From this observation we conclude that the structural rearrangement does not represent the most-tilted end of a continuum of increasing lattice curvature, but is a true pentamer-hexamer switch.</p><p id="P19">We observe curvature-dependent changes at the base of helix 7 in the CA<sub>NTD</sub> and in the helix 8/9 loop in the CA<sub>CTD</sub> with which helix 7 forms a small interaction interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). In the average hexamer structure, the R143 sidechain is placed above the helix 8/9 loop, with Q176 pointing downwards. This is the conformation observed in all lower tilt structures (and in the average structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). In contrast, at the most highly tilted hexamer-hexamer contacts, including those in the vicinity of pentamers, R143 is positioned below the helix 8/9 loop and Q176 points upwards. At these positions there is also a shift in the backbone at E175-Q176. At medium tilts we observe a mixture of the two conformations. R143/Q176 do not appear to reconfigure in response to twist. CA molecules that form hexamer-pentamer contacts form a defined intermediate configuration in which Q176 is above R143, but the backbone at E175-Q176 is in the “low-tilt” conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, third column). We will refer to these structural rearrangements as the ‘tilt switch’.</p><p id="P20">Previous structures of CA hexamers assembled into helical tubes have suggested that Y145 engages in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with H62 in some positions within highly curved hexamers (PDBID: 6SKN), contrasting with the situation in planar hexamer crystals where Y145 forms an intermolecular contact with R162 (PDBID: 4XFX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). In contrast, we observe no curvature dependence of interactions involving Y145, H62 and R162 in our curvature variant structures – in all cases, as in the average hexamer structure, the position of Y145 is intermediate between the two previously observed positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Indeed, the entire inter-domain hinge, of which Y145 is the N-terminal residue, is very similar in all structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We next analysed the protein-protein interfaces that mediate hexamer-hexamer interactions at the dimeric and trimeric interfaces in the lattice, as well as at the quasi-equivalent interfaces involving the pentamer. The dimeric interface formed by helix 9 is remarkably invariant across the core surface, and matches the structure and minimal plasticity observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This is in contrast to earlier suggestions that variable curvature is accommodated based on plasticity of the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The three-fold lattice interface formed by helix 10, however, shows variation. At interfaces between three hexamers (independent of tilt and twist angle), helix 10 engages in a symmetrical three-helix bundle, held in place by hydrophobic patch which includes residues I201, L202, A204 and L205, as previously observed in helical arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). At interfaces between a pentamer and two hexamers, one hexamer helix is removed from the bundle and instead forms a new contact with helix 11 of the other hexamer, involving residues A204 and A217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). There is a small amount of flexibility in the precise structures of hexamer-hexamer three-fold lattice interfaces as a result of tilt and twist variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), likely facilitated by the non-specific nature of the hydrophobic interactions at this site, however none of these structures resemble the structure at the hexamer-pentamer interface. The hydrophobic helix 2-3 interface around the central pore also provides a small degree of flexibility, allowing relative motion of neighbouring CA<sub>NTD</sub> domains in response to lattice bending and twisting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structures from cores bound to FG-repeat peptides</title><p id="P22">To investigate what effect the hexamer-pentamer switch and the tilt switch have on host protein binding we next repeated our structural analysis on cores incubated with FG repeat containing peptides; Nup153<sub>(1407-1429)</sub>, CPSF6<sub>(276-290)</sub> and Sec24C<sub>(228-242)</sub>. All three of these peptides have been described to bind to mature CA hexamers via an FG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We determined structures of hexamers from peptide-bound cores to nominal resolutions of 2.6Å, 3.1Å and 3.1Å and associated pentamers to 3.1Å, 3.5Å and 3.2Å respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Within all three hexamer reconstructions we observe unambiguous density for the corresponding peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) which adopt structures essentially identical to previously reported crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In contrast, we do not detect any density corresponding to peptides bound to pentamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), though in all three cases peptide density is visible in the binding pocket of the hexamers immediately adjacent to the pentamers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). From these observations we conclude that the hexamer-pentamer switch described above prevents binding of the FG motif in these peptides to the pentamer. Superposition of our peptide-bound hexamer CA<sub>NTD</sub> structures and our pentamer CA<sub>NTD</sub> structure confirms that residue M66 in the pentamer would clash with the binding position of phenylalanine within the pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Further comparison of our peptide bound and unbound hexamer structures revealed that the tilt switch adopts the bulk, lower-tilt conformation in the average hexamer in the CPSF6<sub>(276-290)</sub> and Sec24C<sub>(228-242)</sub> bound capsids, as seen in the unbound apo hexamer. In contrast, in the Nup153<sub>(1407-1429)</sub> bound capsid, the switch is in the high-tilt conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) with R143 positioned below the helix 8/9 loop, Q176 pointing upwards and the shift in the backbone position at E175-Q176. The peptide-bound structures are, in all cases, consistent with the available crystal structures, suggesting that the interaction of P1411 and S1412 in Nup153 with Q176, A177 and R143 in CA stabilizes the high-tilt conformation of the tilt-switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The FG motifs in Sec24c and CPSF6 adopt a more compact structure and do not interact with these residues of CA. We proceeded to classify the Nup153<sub>(1407-1429)</sub> in bound hexamers according to tilt/twist and position relative to pentamers to generate context-specific structures exactly as described above for the apo capsid. This analysis yielded structures at resolutions from 3.1 – 3.7 Å. Inspection of these resulting densities revealed no detectable changes in the tilt-switch or in the Nup153 binding pocket, suggesting that Nup153 binding stabilizes the high-tilt conformation of the switch at all tilt angles. We did however, detect an increase in relative Nup153 peptide density at higher tilt angles, suggesting increased peptide occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We posit that the increase in observed Nup153<sub>(1407-1429)</sub> occupancy at higher tilts correlates with the arrangement of the R143/Q176 tilt switch in the apo form, because the high-tilt conformation is favourable for Nup153<sub>(1407-1429)</sub> binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">CA must be flexible enough to accommodate curvature differences across the surface of the conical core, where angles between neighboring hexamers can vary by 30°. It must also be flexible enough to fill both pentameric and hexameric positions in the core surface. The scenario once considered most likely was that flexibility was accommodated by the inter-domain hinge and the dimeric interface involving helix 9, both of which vary in solution and in helical arrays of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Our previous low-resolution analysis of the CA flexibility within intact virions suggested that, instead, flexibility is accommodated by small structural changes distributed throughout CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), and this is largely consistent with recent analysis of helical CA arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The higher-resolution data presented here allow structural changes to be analyzed at the amino-acid level. Both the inter-domain hinge and the dimeric interface are homogeneous across the full range of hexamer-hexamer curvatures, and at interfaces between hexamers and pentamers. As suggested by the low-resolution analysis, variable curvature is indeed accommodated by small, distributed changes that do not impact the local bonding interactions between amino acids, but that can combine over longer distances to change curvature. Hydrophobic interfaces at the three-fold axis and in the helix 2-3 interface around the central hexamer pore provide slippery surfaces that can help accommodate flexibility of the hexamer. Within the hexameric lattice the only clear exception to this general observation is the tilt switch.</p><p id="P25">How does CA adapt its structure at the pentameric positions in the lattice? The 2-fold interface at helix 9 formed by the pentamer-forming CA<sub>CTD</sub> with the neighboring hexamer is essentially the same as the interface between two hexamers, while the hydrophobic interfaces at helix 10/11 adapt to the change in geometry at the pseudo-three-fold axis between one pentamer and two hexamers. The relative positioning of the CA<sub>NTD</sub> and CA<sub>CTD</sub> within the monomer is also very similar between pentamers and hexamers. Indeed, superimposing the CA<sub>CTD</sub> of a monomer from the hexamer, with that of a CA monomer from the pentamer, results in a closely overlapping CA<sub>NTD</sub> with minimal difference in the hinge orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Overall, the impression is that the CA lattice around the five-fold position continues to grow via a conserved two-fold interface into the five-fold position. This growth positions the CA<sub>NTD</sub> relative to the neighboring CA<sub>CTD</sub> such that it would lead to a clash of the CA<sub>NTD</sub> loop between helices 3 and 4, and R173 in the neighboring CA<sub>CTD</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). This clash is resolved by the ‘hexamer-pentamer switch’ which alters the position of this loop, allowing interaction between E28 and R173 to stabilize the pentamer-specific packing of CA<sub>NTD</sub> and neighboring CA<sub>CTD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This may lead to an exchange of interactions: in the pentamer E29 interacts with K30, while in the hexamer E28 may interact with K30, leaving E29 exposed in the pore to possibly interact with K25 in the absence of IP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). The E28A/E29A double mutant, as well as the R173K mutant, are able to assemble and release immature-like particles but are non-infectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The pentameric packing results in a much more compact arrangement of helix 1 around the pore and a much greater charge density where the K25 residues from five CA molecules are close together. This provides a possible explanation for why pentamer formation, in contrast to hexamer formation, is dependent on K25 and IP6 or similar charged molecules for assembly (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript).</p><p id="P26">The hexamer-pentamer switch also alters the conformation of the FG repeat binding pocket. Our structures in the presence of host peptides show that this change prevents binding of FG repeat peptides from Nup153, CPSF6 and Sec24c to this pocket in the pentamer. What are the possible implications of this for core function? On one hand it lowers the density of FG repeat binding sites at the tips of the core, in particular at the highly-curved tip of the narrow end of the core where pentamers are enriched. This may facilitate access for proteins that bind elsewhere on CA, for example the cytoplasmic Nup358 may more easily interact with the CypA loop at the tips of the cores if the occupancy of other proteins to the FG repeat binding site is lower. On the other hand, it provides a pentamer-specific structure, that may provide a binding site for as-yet-unknown host proteins that are required for transport to or into the nucleus.</p><p id="P27">The tilt-switch provides a second mechanism by which host proteins might preferentially bind particular regions of the core surface. It would allow Nup153 to preferentially bind to the more curved regions of the core which are localized towards the ends of the cone. Where different cellular proteins are competing for the same pocket in capsid, this might in turn lead to other proteins binding to flatter parts of the capsid surface What are the possible implications of this for core function? On one hand, it may allow different host proteins to cluster on different regions of the core surface, creating local functional surfaces with high allostery. On the other hand, it may orient the core in defined ways, for example positioning regions of higher curvature towards regions of high Nup153 density during nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We speculate that maintaining local regions of core surface that specialize in interaction with different host proteins is one of the evolutionary advantages provided by the unusual conical shape of the HIV-1 core.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="P29">Protein expression and purification, and in vitro assembly of CLPs were performed exactly as described in the accompanying manuscript (Highland et al, accompanying manuscript).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Cryo-EM grid preparation</title><p id="P30">C-Flat CF-2/2-3Cu-50 grids were glow-discharged for 45 seconds with a current of 25 mA in a PELCO easiGlow glow discharger immediately before use.

recruits cellular proteins to direct the capsid to the nucleus. The cone forms from hexamers of CA protein, and twelve pentamers that accommodate curvature. We obtained detailed 3D models of pentamers and hexamers at positions on capsid surfaces with different curvatures. We find two places in CA that switch conformation according to the local capsid curvature and whether CA is in a pentamer or hexamer. We also obtained models of CA bound to peptides from cellular proteins. The data show how switches in CA help it form a cone shape, and interact differently with cellular proteins at different positions on the cone surface.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of the HIV-1 CA Hexamer and Pentamer from in-vitro assembled core-like particles</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Isosurface representation of a single-particle reconstruction of the CA pentamer, viewed from the side.

At high tilts there is a shift in the backbone in the vicinity of residue Q176, which is not observed in CA monomers forming hexamer-pentamer contacts. <bold>(C)</bold> Superposition of models of the tilt-switch region from CA monomers in low tilt regions (light green (NTD) and light orange (CTD)) and high tilt regions (dark green (NTD) and dark orange (CTD)). <bold>(D)</bold> Superposition of the average hexamer model (green), with PDBID:6SKN (Ni et al., 2020) (grey) and PDBID:4XFX (Gres et al., 2015) (blue), showing the relative configurations of H62 and Y145 as well as R162 of the neighbouring monomer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157997-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Flexibility of CA and its interactions.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Superposition of CA structures from the hexamer (orange), and pentamer (red). Superpositions of structures obtained from different tilt/twist classes, coloured blue to magenta.

The dimeric interface is largely conserved, whereas trimeric contact points including a pentamer form a new interaction between helix 10 and 11. <bold>(C)</bold> Superposition of structures obtained from different tilt/twist classes at the dimeric and trimeric interfaces, as well as in the region of helices 2 and 3 in the NTD. Minimal structural changes are observed at the dimeric interface, whereas the trimeric interface and interface between NTDs show rotations at hydrophobic interfaces.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157997-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The hexamer-pentamer switch and the tilt switch regulate cofactor binding</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Isosurface representation and ribbon models of the FG-binding pocket of the CA hexamer reconstructed from cores incubated without peptide and with peptides from Nup153<sub>(1407-1423)</sub>, CPSF6<sub>(313-327)</sub> and Sec24C<sub>(228-242)</sub>.
