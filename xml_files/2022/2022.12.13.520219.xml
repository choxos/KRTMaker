However, we have a limited understanding of the survival and secondary responses of memory T cells with cytokine producing capacities. We interrogate antigen-specific CD4 T cells using a mouse influenza A virus infection model. CD4 T cells with the capacity to produce cytokines survive better than non-cytokine+ cells, displaying a low fold contraction and expressing high levels of pro-survival molecules, CD127 and Bcl2. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a heterogenous population of memory CD4 T cells with three clusters of cytokine+ cells. These clusters match flow cytometry data revealing an enhanced survival signature in cells capable of producing multiple cytokines. These multifunctional cells are, however, less likely to proliferate during and following primary and secondary infections. Despite this, multifunctional memory T cells form a substantial fraction of the secondary memory pool, indicating that survival rather than proliferation may dictate which populations survive within the memory pool.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F9" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS158910-f009"/></fig>

Cytokine production by memory T cells is often central to this protective response and the presence of T cells that can produce multiple different cytokines is associated with the most effective immune protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Understanding which memory T cells provide the most effective protection and the signals that generate these cells is a key target towards producing more effective vaccines.</p><p id="P5">Improving our understanding of T cell memory is particularly important in the context of highly variable infections such as Influenza A Virus (IAV). While neutralising antibodies can prevent IAV infection, the frequent mutations within viral surface proteins makes it difficult for these strain specific antibodies to recognise altered viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. As current IAV vaccines also induce antibodies that target strain specific surface proteins, they induce limited protection against different serotypes. This mechanism of escaping humoral immunity is also observed in other pathogens including HIV and SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">We know cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T cells are key in protection against respiratory viruses, including IAV, at primary infection and upon reinfection with the same or altered viral strains. Importantly, CD4 and CD8 T cells recognise epitopes that are often conserved between IAV strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The presence of cytokine producing IAV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in human peripheral blood correlates with cross-strain protection against symptomatic influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Mechanistic mouse studies have further demonstrated the protective ability of IAV specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, with the inflammatory T-helper (Th1) cytokine, interferon-γ, often key to this response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The cytokines TNF and interleukin (IL-) 2 are also implicated in protection to IAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These data support that the most effective memory T cells are those with the capacity to produce cytokines, in particularly multifunctional cells that can produce several different cytokines.</p><p id="P7">Memory T cells with the capacity to produce effector cytokines such as IFNγ and TNF can be classified as effector memory T (Tem) cells that can migrate through the blood and non-lymphoid tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In contrast, central memory T (Tcm) cells that migrate through secondary lymphoid organs can be capable of strong proliferation and are multipotent, differentiating into different functional subsets including effector cytokine producing cells and T follicular helper cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Cytokine producing memory T cells can also be found within populations of memory T cells located in non-lymphoid tissues that do not recirculate. These tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) can provide rapid protection to re-infection. These studies suggest vaccines should aim to induce Trm cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, heterosubtypic immunity to IAV, mainly mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells, wanes in the months following infection of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Most studies agree that lung memory CD8 and CD4 T cells decline over time, although recruitment of circulating cells or homeostatic proliferation may maintain these populations to some extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. A long-lived protective memory response may, therefore, also be dependent on the generation of memory T cells beyond the pathogen-targeted tissue.</p><p id="P9">Fundamentally, a deeper understanding of protective memory T cells is required to reveal which memory T cells vaccines should aim to generate. We previously showed that multifunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells increase in predominance from the primary to the memory pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Building on this finding, we have now characterised the generation, survival, and function of these memory T cells following IAV infection in multiple tissues.</p><p id="P10">We define that a low fold contraction and a low level of proliferation by multifunctional T cells defines their increased predominance in the memory pool. Moreover, focusing on the CD4 compartment, we show T cells producing multiple cytokines demonstrate a strong pro-survival transcriptional signature. However, despite this pro-survival signature, multifunctional T cells proliferated poorly during a secondary IAV challenge <italic>in vivo</italic>, in contrast to single IFNγ+ T cells. By comparing memory CD4 T cells that do or do not have the capacity to produce cytokines, we reveal that cytokine producing T cells have an enhanced capacity to survive into the memory pool. Consequently, our study challenges the memory T cell paradigm that less differentiated central memory T cells have enhanced survival compared to more differentiated effector memory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MHC tetramers and ex vivo cytokine analysis enable a comparison of CD4 and CD8 T cell phenotype and function following IAV infection</title><p id="P11">We used MHC I and MHC II tetramers (tet) containing immunodominant IAV nucleoprotein (NP) peptides, (NP<sub>368-74</sub> and NP<sub>311-325</sub>) to identify IAV-specific T cells longitudinally following IAV infection, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>; gating shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. These same peptides were used to separately activate cells from the same mice <italic>ex vivo</italic> to examine the anti-IAV T cell cytokine responses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, as optimal dual staining of MHC tetramers and cytokines was not possible. IAV infected animals were injected with fluorescently labelled anti-CD45 shortly before euthanasia to label cells in the blood; lung IAV-specific T cells that are CD45iv negative are likely Trm cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">In the lymphoid organs, the majority of MHC tet+ and cytokine+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were negative for CD45iv, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>. The majority of lung IAV specific CD4 T cells were also not labelled with the i.v. injected anti-CD45 at any timepoints. In comparison, around 50-60% of the MHCI tet+ CD8 T cells were CD45iv+ at all time points and the proportion of labelled CD8 IAV specific IFN-γ+ and TNF+ T cells in the lung increased after day 9.</p><p id="P13">We examined the phenotype of the MHC tet+ T cells comparing cells in the spleen, dLN and lung across the three time points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C-D</xref>. There were too few MHCII tet+ CD45+ lung CD4 T cells at memory time points to analyse reliably, but we have included data on CD45iv+ CD8 T cells.</p><p id="P14">As expected, PD1 was expressed on activated T cells and declined after day 9 on CD4 and CD8 T cells in T cells from all organs. However, MHC tet+ CD45iv negative CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lung continued to express higher levels than T cells from the lymphoid organs. The cell surface markers CD69 and CD103 are associated with Trm cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Expression of these molecules increased on CD8 MHCI tet+ cells in the lymphoid organs and CD45iv negative lung cells after day 9. However, very few CD4 MHCII tet+ cells expressed these markers.</p><p id="P15">While at day 9 some CD4 MHCII tet+ cells in the lung expressed CX3CR1, only a small minority of memory cells expressed this chemokine receptor. CX3CR1 was expressed by CD8 MHCI tet+ cells, most prominently in the spleen and on lung CD45iv+ cells suggesting that these are circulating effector memory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">The phenotype of the lung CD45iv+ MHCI tet+ CD8 T cells more closely resembled the cells in the spleen rather than the CD45iv negative cells in the lung. The exception was in expression of CD69. While spleen MHCI tet+ CD8 T cells increased expression of CD69 across the time course, the circulating lung MHCI tet+ CD8 T cells remained low.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>T cells with the capacity to produce cytokines are more likely to enter the memory pool than non-cytokine+ T cells</title><p id="P17">We examined the decline of T cells detected with either MHC tetramers or IFNγ production following NP peptide restimulation. We focused on the decline between the peak response at day 9 to day 30, following the contraction phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As MHC tetramers detect NP specific T cells regardless of their ability to produce cytokines, altered dynamics of decline between these cells and those that are cytokine+ are suggestive of differences between cells that can and cannot produce cytokine.</p><p id="P18">CD4 MHC tet+ T cells declined in all three organs between day 9 and 30. In contrast, IFN γ+ cells did not decline in the secondary lymphoid organ, although these cells did decline in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, the numbers of IL-2+ and TNF+ did not decline in the spleen and dLN between day 9-30 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). As for IFNγ+ cells, TNF+ cells declined in the lung but the numbers of IL-2+ cells were stable. These data suggest that, at least in secondary lymphoid organs, cytokine+ cells are less likely to be lost during the contraction phase than those that do not produce cytokine.</p><p id="P19">In contrast, IAV specific CD8 T cells detected by either MHC tetramers, IFNγ or TNF, remained stable between day 9 and 30 in secondary lymphoid organs, although in all cases these cells declined in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). While the number of IL-2+ CD8 T cells were low, these cells were maintained at stable numbers in the spleen and lung, but did drop in the dLN.</p><p id="P20">Interestingly, for CD4 T cells, these changes were accompanied by an increase in sensitivity to peptide by the cytokine+ cells, with memory CD4 T cells producing TNF and IL-2 at lower peptide concentrations than cells at day 9. In contrast, primary and memory CD8 T cell cytokine production was unaffected by the peptide dose, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>. These data highlight important distinction between CD4 and CD8 T cells at primary and memory time points.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Memory T cells with the capacity to produce cytokines express higher levels of pro-survival molecules than T cells that cannot produce cytokines</title><p id="P21">To examine why IAV specific CD4 cytokine+ and negative populations may display different dynamics we compared their phenotype and function by taking advantage of a reporter mouse we have developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In these triple transgenic, ‘TRACE’ mice, activated T cells express rtTA, which, when bound to doxycycline, activates the tet-ON promoter, driving Cre expression which leads to permanent EYFP production at the ROSA locus. Infection with IAV induced a substantial population of EYFP+ CD4 T cells when triple transgenic mice were fed a doxycycline+ diet during the initial infection, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>. This model greatly increases the number of responding T cells we can identify and enables identification of cytokine+ and negative EYFP+ cells within the same sample, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>.</p><p id="P22">As the EYFP+ CD4 T cells are likely to respond to an array of IAV antigens, we used bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) cultured with a sonicated IAV antigen preparation to restimulate the T cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> for cytokine analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>. The expression of the pro-survival molecules CD127 and Bcl2 was examined in EYFP+ cytokine negative CD4 T cells and those expressing IFNγ, IL-2 and TNF following <italic>ex vivo</italic> restimulation of cells taken from mice infected 40 days previously, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>. In the secondary lymphoid organs, the cytokine+ EYFP+ T cells expressed higher levels of both molecules compared to cytokine negative cells. These differences were less clear in the lung, potentially reflecting the reduced survival of cytokine+ and negative cells in this organ, but all cytokine+ cells expressed significantly higher levels of Bcl2 than the non-cytokine+ cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CD4 T cells with the capacity to produce cytokines have an enhanced survival capacity compared to non-cytokine+ T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>T cells that can produce multiple cytokines are more persistent than those that only have the capacity to produce IFNγ</title><p id="P23">To investigate the cytokine+ T cells in more detail, we separated these into single IFN γ+, double IFNγ+ TNF+ or IL-2+ cells, or triple cytokine+ cells detected following reactivation with IAV Ag-loaded DCs. Triple cytokine+ CD4 T cells did not decline in any of the organs between days 9 and 30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. All other populations declined significantly in at least one of the organs examined although cells in the lymph node had limited decline regardless of which population was examined.</p><p id="P24">There were no significant declines in the numbers of cytokine+ CD8 T cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. However, in the lung, while triple cytokine+ CD8 T cells were clearly stable, the single IFN γ+ and double IFNγ+TNF+ cells displayed non-significant drops.</p><p id="P25">The triple cytokine+ T cells may display greater persistence than the single IFNγ+ T cells because they express higher levels of survival molecules. To address this, we compared the expression of pro-survival molecules, CD127 and Bcl2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, on single, double and triple cytokine+ cells. There were too few triple+ CD8 T cells in any organ and too few cytokine+ cells in the dLN to compare the MFI of the different populations. Therefore, we focussed on cytokine producing CD4 T cells in the spleen and lung.</p><p id="P26">At day 30 post-infection, we found that double and triple cytokine+ CD4 T cells in the spleen had higher expression of CD127 and triple+ cells in the spleen expressed more Bcl2 than double IFNγ+TNF+ cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>. While there was a trend for the triple cytokine+ cells in the lung to express higher levels of CD127 and Bcl2, this did not reach significance. These data suggest that the differences in these two pro-survival molecules may not be sufficient to explain the altered survival in lung cytokine+ memory T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Single IFNγ+ CD4 and CD8 T cells are more likely to be in cell cycle than multifunctional T cells</title><p id="P27">An alternative explanation for the enhanced stability of triple cytokine+ T cells was increased proliferation by the triple cytokine+ as compared to single IFNγ+ cells. We addressed this by examining Ki67, expressed during the cell cycle. We focussed on T cells detected following <italic>ex vivo</italic> reactivation with DCs presenting IAV antigens as these provided more robust populations than following peptide-restimulation. The numbers of IFNγ/IL-2 double+ T cells were low and therefore were not included in the analysis.</p><p id="P28">In the dLN at day 9, over 20% of the CD4 and 30% of the CD8 cytokine+ T cells were Ki67+. In contrast, in the spleen and lung, less than 15% of the CD4 and 25% or less of CD8 cytokine+ cells were Ki67+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>. As expected, the percentages of T cells that were Ki67+ decreased from day 9 to day 30 and very few Ki67+ cells could be detected on day 70.</p><p id="P29">We gated on the IFNγ+ Ki67+ cells to examine whether these cells were producing one or more of the cytokines. We hypothesised that triple cytokine+ cells may be more likely to proliferate to maintain their numbers in the memory pool. In contrast, we found the opposite result: IFNγ single+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were more likely to be in cell cycle compared to triple+ cells at both day 9 and 30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>. These data rule out the hypothesis that triple cytokine+ cells increase proportionally in the memory pool compared to the primary pool because they proliferate more than single IFNγ+ cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Single cell RNAseq analysis reveals a heterogeneity in cytokine+ and cytokine negative CD4 memory T cell populations</title><p id="P30">To obtain a more detailed understanding of differences between the cytokine positive and negative memory T cell populations, we performed single-cell gene transcription analysis.

CD45iv negative, EYFP+ CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells from the spleen and lung and control naïve (CD44<sup>lo</sup>/EYFP negative) spleen cells were FACS sorted and gene expression examined via BD-Rhapsody single-cell transcriptomic analysis using the Immune Response Targeted panel for mouse.</p><p id="P31">Initial clustering produced 19 different clusters, including 8 naïve/central memory clusters, 10 memory clusters and one Treg cluster, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>.

This ensure that neutralising antibody to the WSN-IAV surface proteins does not prevent infection and T cell reactivation. In this model, T cell responses are associated with immune protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As expected, IAV-memory mice were protected from weight loss following infection with X31 -IAV, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p id="P41">We analysed cytokine production by memory T cells before and 5 days after re-infection. The numbers of cytokine+ (IFNγ, IL-2, TNF) CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only slightly following re-infection, Fig 8A-B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7B-C</xref>. Re-infection also led to an increase in the percentages of cytokine+ cells that were in cell cycle, most notably in cells in the spleen and dLN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7D-E</xref>. This was the case for both CD4 and CD8 T cells and regardless of which cytokine we examined; we did not analyse IL-2+ CD8 T cells as the numbers were too low. Most of the cytokine+ T cells were not, however, positive for Ki67, reflecting the low increase in cell number.</p><p id="P42">We next examined whether the IFNγ+ Ki67+ T cells were skewed towards single or multifunctional T cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E-F</xref>. For CD4 T cells in the dLN and lung, single IFNγ+ and double IFNγ+TNF+ cells had higher expression of Ki67 than triple cytokine+ cells. We saw a similar pattern in CD8 T cells in the spleen, dLN and lung with triple cytokine+ least likely to be Ki67+.</p><p id="P43">The low levels of Ki67 in triple cytokine+ cells may suggest that these cells would be less prevalent following reactivation and that single or double positive T cells may become a more prominent population. This was not the case. The percentages of IFNγ+ cells that were also expressing IL-2 and/or TNF were the same before and at day 5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7F</xref> and day 35 following re-infection, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8G-H</xref>. Moreover, mice given a primary infection with X31 had similar proportions of single, double and triple+ cells at day 35; too few cells were present in the primary infected mice at day 5 to analyse.</p><p id="P44">These data suggest that while CD4 triple cytokine+ T cells may be less likely to proliferate following reactivation, they are equally, or potentially better, equipped to survive into the secondary memory pool. In contrast, the single and double cytokine+ T cells that do proliferate following re-infection may be more likely to undergo apoptosis. Together these data suggest that these cytokine+ cell populations have distinct roles to perform during secondary response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P45">Here we reveal extensive heterogeneity within the memory CD4 T cell pool in lymphoid organs and the lung. Transcriptomic heterogeneity was clearly present within cells with the capacity to produce IFNγ, the key cytokine most associated with protection from IAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Importantly, our data suggest that heterogeneity within the memory pool also covers a spectrum of cells that do not fit into our current memory T cell paradigms that were first defined based on cell migration patterns rather than functional capacity.</p><p id="P46">Using various approaches to track IAV specific CD4 T cells we have made a number of key novel findings. First, our data show that the capacity to produce cytokines marks T cells with an enhanced ability to survive into the memory pool. Identification of the factors and cell types that promote cytokine+ cells could define how we could increase the size of the memory T cell pool following vaccination.</p><p id="P47">Cytokine+ CD4 T cells in secondary lymphoid organs expressed higher levels of the IL-7 receptor, CD127, and these cells and cytokine+ cells in the lung expressed higher levels of the anti-apoptosis molecule, Bcl2 than cytokine negative cells. Moreover, cells that expressed multiple cytokines had the highest expression of these molecules and expressed a number of pro-survival molecules at mRNA level. IL-7, which promotes Bcl2 expression, is a well-established survival signal for memory CD4 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Which signals promote expression of CD127 on the cytokine+ cells will be a key question to address in future studies.</p><p id="P48">Second, within the cytokine+ fraction of the memory pool, we consistently identified three populations based on the capacity to produce one or more of IFNγ+, IL-2 and TNF. These three populations expressed distinct chemokine receptors, different levels and types of markers of T cell activation, and pro-survival molecules. These data suggest that these cells may have defined anatomical niches perhaps as a driver or result of their differentiation. These differences may impact on the cells’ survival and, importantly, their responses to reinfection. Alternatively, the populations could be distinct temporal states with cells oscillating between these clusters depending on recent interactions with other cell types and/or soluble molecules within their environment. Regardless, the data indicate a breadth in phenotype and function that has important implications for discussions on how we can most usefully define memory CD4 T cells subsets to advance an integrated understanding of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">A caveat of our model is that detection of the cytokine producing cells involves a short <italic>ex vivo</italic> reactivation stage. We therefore cannot know whether the expression of these molecules is altered during the reactivation. Our previous data did, however, demonstrate that single, double, and triple cytokine+ populations could be identified as early as 2 hours after reactivation, suggesting that these three populations are reflective of <italic>in vivo</italic> CD4 T cells with distinct phenotypes and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P50">Double IFNγ+/TNF+ CD4 memory T cells often displayed an intermediate phenotype between triple cytokine+ cells and single IFNγ+ cells, for example in expression of Ki67, PD1, ICOS, Myc and the cytokines themselves. We think it is an over-simplification to consider these cells an intermediator phase between single and triple cytokine+ cells as the double cytokine+ cells had a distinct transcriptional signature. Notably, the transcriptional signature of the double IFNγ+/TNF+ has some overlap with Tfh cells and the recently described T resident helper cells, including expression of <italic>Cxcr5</italic> and <italic>Bcl6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Resident Tfh and memory-Tfh like cells have been shown to differentiate into multiple different effector subsets upon re-activation <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting these cells retain a level of plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. To test definitively the relationships between the three cytokine populations, comprehensive longitudinal lineage tracing approaches would be required.</p><p id="P51">We were surprised that the double and triple cytokine+ CD4 memory T cells did not dominate the secondary response to IAV. These cells expressed high level of transcripts for <italic>Myc, Slc7a5</italic> and the transferrin receptor, suggesting that they are poised to respond and proliferate following TCR activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We cannot exclude that memory triple or double cytokine+ CD4 T cells differentiate into single IFNγ+ during the re-infection. We think this is unlikely given the small changes in cell number and the stability of proportions of triple/double/single cytokine+ cells at days 5 and 30 following IAV re-infection. While there has been limited analysis of tertiary memory CD4 T cells, Bresser <italic>et al</italic> recently demonstrated that central memory CD8 T cell that have previously undergone the fewest rounds of division and have low expression of ‘effector cell’ genes dominate the secondary response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. In contrast, Wirth <italic>et al</italic> found that CD8 T cells can show increasing complexity following subsequent activation suggesting a contribution from multiple memory population to the tertiary pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P52">We identified IAV specific CD4 T cells using methods that restrict the population to a single immunodominant epitope or to T cells responding to numerous IAV epitopes. Our results are consistent between these methods suggesting that TCR specificity does not influence T cell survival into the memory pool. This conclusion is reinforced by finding the same TCR clones in several of the clusters within the single-cell RNAseq dataset. We suggest that environment is more likely, therefore, to dictate cell fate, than signals through the TCR.</p><p id="P53">We have analysed IAV specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the same animals highlighting some key differences between these cell types. Most notably, cytokine+ CD8 T cells display a very limited decline in lymphoid organs. This reflects similar findings in LCMV infected mice in which the numbers of CD8 memory T cells able to produce cytokine following peptide stimulation remained stable for over 900 days while memory CD4 T cells declined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. A second distinction in our study was revealed by examining sensitivity to the immunodominant peptides. While CD8 T cells produced a maximal cytokine response regardless of peptide dose, CD4 T cells produced less cytokine at lower peptide doses. It will be important to extend these data, examining T cells responding to other epitopes.</p><p id="P54">We did find consistent patterns of proliferation in IAV specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Single IFNγ+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were more likely to be Ki67+ at primary, memory and recall timepoints compared to triple or double cytokine+ T cells. These data suggest that the link between proliferation capacity and multi-functionality is common to both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this link could, therefore, reveal pathways that can be manipulated to enhance both the CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the context of infectious disease and cancer, or limit such responses in autoimmune pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals and Study design</title><p id="P55">The aim of this study was to understand how cytokine production by memory CD4 and CD8 T cells changes over time and following a challenge re-infection.
