As well as impacting microbial ecology, physiology and evolution, phages are exploited as tools in molecular biology and biotechnology. This is particularly true for the Ff (f1, fd or M13) phages, which represent a widely distributed group of filamentous viruses. Over nearly five decades, Ff has seen an extraordinary range of applications, including in phage display and nanotechnology. However, the complete structure of the phage capsid and consequently the mechanisms of infection and assembly remain largely mysterious. Using cryo-electron microscopy and a highly efficient system for production of short Ff-derived nanorods, we have determined the first structure of a filamentous virus, including the filament tips. Structure combined with mutagenesis was employed to identify domains of the phage that are important in bacterial attack and for release of new phage progeny. These data allow new models to be proposed for the phage lifecycle and will undoubtedly enable the development of novel biotechnological applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Filamentous phages are widely distributed viruses infecting all bacterial genera and some archaea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. A number of filamentous phages infecting Gram-negative bacteria have been implicated in virulence, for example horizontal gene transfer of cholera toxin in <italic>Vibrio cholerae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>,</italic> or biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</italic> The phages are approximately one micron long and 6-7 nm wide - visualised as “hair-like” filaments by electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. A notable feature of the filamentous phage lifecycle is that they replicate and egress without killing their bacterial host. Most extensively studied in this group are the F-specific filamentous phages (Ffs) that include viruses f1, M13 and fd and infect cells by binding to the F-pilus of <italic>E. coli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</italic> The phages are 98.5% identical in their DNA sequence and are used interchangeably. Ffs are also strikingly simple - their single-stranded DNA genome encodes just 11 proteins, of which 5 form the phage capsid. This simplicity, plus their high stability, has facilitated their use in modern biotechnology - for example in phage display, as a vaccine carrier, in tissue engineering, as a high-powered lithium battery, and in phage therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Despite their extensive downstream applications, the structure of the entire phage capsid assembly remains a mystery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">pVIII is the “major” capsid protein that forms the filamentous body of the phage. The tips of the filament are formed of the “minor” capsid proteins which occur in pairs. pIII and pVI form the “leading” end of the infecting phage, which interacts with the host receptors to initiate entry, whereas pVII and pIX form the “trailing” end<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In order for the phage to inject its DNA into the bacterial cytoplasm, it must navigate both the <italic>E. coli</italic> outer and cytoplasmic membranes. Adsorption of the phage to the F-pilus is initiated by the tip protein pIII, which has been divided into 3 domains: N1, N2 and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Specifically, the N2 domain binds to the F-pilus tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), which has two important effects: 1) the F-pilus retracts, bringing the phage to the bacterial surface; and 2) a conformational change occurs in pIII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This frees the N1 domain, enabling it to bind to the periplasmic domain of the secondary receptor TolA, which is part of the TolQRA complex embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The mechanism by which phage is able to cross the two membranes is unknown.</p><p id="P6">The C domain of pIII is involved in virion uncoating and DNA entry into the host cell cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), where the major capsid protein pVIII is stripped off and integrates into the cytoplasmic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The host transcription and translation machinery replicates the Ff genome, and phage-encoded proteins are synthesised.</p><p id="P7">Newly synthesised Ff particles exit the cell through a phage-encoded trans-membrane egress machinery, comprised of proteins pI and pXI in the inner membrane, and pIV in the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We recently determined the structure of pIV by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), revealing how the gates in the channel would need to open to allow phage to egress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">All phage capsid proteins are synthesised initially as integral membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The DNA packaging signal is a hairpin, which interacts with the C-terminal residues of the cap proteins pVII and pIX to enable DNA to be incorporated into new virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The “major” coat protein pVIII is then added, until the entire genome is covered. pIII and pVI are subsequently added as a terminating cap and the phage is released<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The phage is now in reverse orientation, with the tip proteins pVII / pIX forming the “leading” end of the egressing filament, and pIII / pVI forming the “trailing” end<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">From a structural perspective, the major capsid protein pVIII is the most well-studied to date, with experiments employing fibre-diffraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, NMR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and in one case cryoEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Whilst the latter study provided the first direct view of the pVIII filament, atomic model building was not possible. With improvements in cryoEM methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, a high-resolution cryoEM structure of a related pVIII protein filament from phage Ike was determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The four minor cap proteins have not however been amenable to structural characterisation, with the exception of N-terminal fragments of pIII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, how the capsid proteins interact with one another to form the assembled phage remains elusive.</p><p id="P10">Currently, cryoEM is the only technique that could be employed to determine a high-resolution structure of an entire filamentous virus. However, determination of protein structures by cryoEM requires averaging thousands of copies of the protein of interest. Due to the length of Ffs (<sup>~</sup>1 μm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, the tips are usually present at extremely low abundance in high-magnification images, which makes structural determination challenging. To overcome this, we generated a short version of Ff. This is possible because the length of Ffs can be modulated by changing the size of the packaged DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We developed a phage-free plasmid-based system that enables a short version of Ff to be produced based on f1 phage. These are referred to as “nanorods” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This technology has enabled us to determine the first high-resolution structure of a filamentous phage assembly, allowing biochemical data to be reconciled and models proposed for infection, assembly and egress.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of the f1-derived nanorods</title><p id="P11">Nanorods were produced using a two-plasmid system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). A nanorod template plasmid was used to generate circular single-stranded DNA 529 nucleotides long, alongside a helper plasmid encoding all f1 phage proteins. On transformation of both plasmids into bacteria, 529-nt circular ssDNA was produced and subsequently packaged into short phage-like nanorod particles by the f1 proteins expressed from the helper plasmid. pVIII contained a Y21M replacement shown previously to result in a more stable conformation of the major coat protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

In micrographs, nanorods were observed as structures of <sup>~</sup>80 nm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2D</xref>), with two distinctive ends: one “round” and one “pointy” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Automated particle picking was performed using Warp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> for the tips and cryoSPARC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> for the filament, and both datasets were subsequently processed using cryoSPARC. After 2D classification of the tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), particles could clearly be seen to belong to either the round or pointy classes and were sorted accordingly. Additional 2D classification of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) allowed three different cryoEM maps of the phage to be obtained from a single dataset. All structures had 5-fold symmetry, with the central, filamentous region having additional helical symmetry. The helical parameters were determined using cryoSPARC and were refined to a helical twist of 37.437 ° and a helical rise of 16.599 Å. The final 3D reconstructions, with C5 symmetry applied (and helical symmetry for the central region), produced maps with resolutions of 2.97 Å, 2.58 Å and 2.81 Å for the pointy, filamentous and round structures respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), into which atomic models were built (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movies 1-3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structure of the pIII / pVI pointy tip</title><p id="P13">The pointy tip is comprised of proteins pIII and pVI, present in 5 copies each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). pIII is the largest and most structurally complex capsid protein. It is produced with a signal sequence which is cleaved to leave the mature protein of 406 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Its three domains (N1, N2 and C; of 67, 131 and 150 residues respectively) are separated by two flexible glycine-rich linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In our structure, the N1 and N2 domains (and the glycine linkers) are not visible, but density was seen for residues 257-404 of the C domain (accounting for the entire C domain minus the final two residues). The pIII C domain is comprised of a number of α-helices of differing lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Two β-strands form a hairpin loop which extends over the exterior of the main filamentous part of the virion; reminiscent of sepals protecting a flower bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> box 1). We observed two cysteine residues (354 and 371) in close enough proximity to form an intrachain disulphide bond in the C domain, and these were located at the start and finish of this hairpin loop, pinning it together and further reinforcing the structural motif. pIII is predicted to contain three additional disulphide bonds; two in the N1 domain (between residues 7 and 36, and 46 and 53) and one in the N2 domain (between residues 188 and 201)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The C-terminus of pIII is buried in the centre of the tip, where the five symmetry copies come together to form a distinct stricture in the virion lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> box 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). The lumen measures 8.4 Å across at this point, compared to 20 Å across at its widest point. We observe hydrogen bonds between neighbouring pIII molecules, pinning the tip together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). Two additional inter-chain hydrogen bonds are made between neighbouring pIII subunits; both are situated near rings of methionine residues at the terminus of the pointy tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">pVl is a 112-residue, mostly hydrophobic protein which lacks a signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Density was observed for the entire pVI protein, which is composed of 3 α-helices arranged in a “U” shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The N-terminus of the protein forms the longest α-helix of 54 residues in length, which turns into a short 10 residue α-helix, and then into the final C-terminal α-helix of 32 residues. The C-terminus of pVI is buried in the centre of the pointy tip. Each pVl chain forms seven hydrogen bonds with neighbouring pVI chains; four with one neighbouring chain and three with the other. These bonds are mostly concentrated in the area at the centre of the virion near the pVI C-termini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">pIII and pVI can be seen to interact extensively with each other, within a network of closely-packed helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Five copies of the protein pair are arranged symmetrically to form the pointy tip with helices from both proteins being intertwined. pIII makes 12 hydrogen bonds and 1 salt bridge with its two neighbouring pVI molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The outer surface of pVI (which is pIII-facing) is hydrophobic with two distinct rings of positive charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). pIII forms a negatively charged scaffold around it, with hydrophobic interactions being shielded at the centre of the assembled phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The pointy tip is overall negatively charged and hydrophilic on the solvent-exposed outside.</p><p id="P16">At the pointy tip, there were three areas of density that were unaccounted for in the cryoEM map, lying within the central pore of the virion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The first area, at the very tip of the structure, is surrounded by a ring of phenylalanine residues, a lower ring of methionine residues and a third ring of asparagine residues from the pIII protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). The second, smaller area of density is adjacent to the first, with the asparagine ring defining one end and a second methionine ring the other end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). The third area is located closer to the main body of the filament, where 5 symmetrical curved tubes of density were observed lining a hydrophobic section of the lumen formed by the pVI protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). These tube-like densities are all consistent with the size and shape of fatty acid molecules, which is supported by the knowledge that lipids are not uncommon in the capsids of many different types of virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The binding environment provided by the phage corroborates this observation, with hydrophobic residues lining most of the pocket, and hydrophilic residues available to stabilise the acid group of the fatty acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). Fatty acids were modelled into the map according to their size, suggesting one molecule of octanoic acid (C8) at the tip, followed by one molecule of butanoic acid (C4) and then 5 symmetry-related molecules of dodecanoic acid (C12) in the third site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). Lipids are usually acquired in phages during their assembly, and are thought to aid the infection process by diverse mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structure of the pVII / pIX round tip</title><p id="P17">pVII and pIX are small hydrophobic proteins of only 33 and 32 amino acids respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). They both lack a signal sequence, form a single α-helix, and are present in the tip at five copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In comparison to the pointy tip, the rounded one has a much simpler composition. Five copies of pVII form a helical bundle, packed together using mainly hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), as per the pointy tip. Hydrophobic residues line the sides of the helices that pack together, and the interior of the bundle is also predominantly hydrophobic. The terminus of the rounded end of the phage is comprised of the N-terminus of pVII, which has an overall positive charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). The helices have typical intrahelical hydrogen bonding, with two interchain hydrogen bonds between neighbouring subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). All proteins are arranged with their C-termini orientated towards the DNA and the main body of the phage. This orientation explains why display of peptide or protein at the round tip of Ff is possible only when linked to the N-termini of pVII and pIX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structure of the pVIII filament</title><p id="P18">pVIII is the major capsid protein and forms the main body of the filamentous phage particle. It is produced initially with a signal sequence that is cleaved to leave a single α-helix of 50 residues in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), with thousands of these helices packing together in a helical array to coat the length of the viral DNA genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). The α-helices are slightly curved; with their C-termini projecting into the phage lumen, resulting in an overall highly positive charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10D</xref>). The N-terminus of pVIII is splayed outwards towards the exterior of the capsid. In our structure, density was smeared for the four N-terminal residues (1-4), indicating that these are flexible. The proteins are organised with their N-termini pointing towards the round tip, and their C-termini towards the pointy one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10D</xref>). Ff phages belong to the Class I group of filamentous phages (which also include Ike and If1) on the basis of this five-start helical symmetry, as opposed to class II phages such as Pf1 which have a one-start helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Despite the different symmetries, the overall packing of the pVIII α-helices is the same in both classes.</p><p id="P19">Overlaying a protomer of our f1-derived nanorod pVIII with a previously determined f1 phage pVIII structure (2C0W; determined by X-ray fibre diffraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>) shows that the two are extremely similar (RMSD of 0.976 Å over 39 pruned pairs; RMSD of 1.537 Å across all 46 pairs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). However, when comparing the pentamers by aligning at one protomer, small differences can be seen in the placement of the remaining four chains. Ike and the Ff family share 40% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), with large differences in amino acid properties in some areas. However, overlaying a monomer of pVIII from the Ike filamentous phage (6A7F; determined by cryoEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) shows an even smaller difference between the helices with an RMSD of 0.679 Å (across all 46 pairs). When comparing the pentamers of the f1-derived nanorod pVIII and Ike pVIII, there are again small differences seen in the packing of the individual helices within the pentamer. Interestingly, Ike has a proline at position 30 while all Ff phages have an alanine. This proline mid-way through the helix was proposed to cause the kink observed in the Ike structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, however the kink is still present in the f1-derived nanorod in the absence of the proline.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Structure of the assembled phage</title><p id="P20">The Ff phages can be thought of as pentameric building blocks with the first layer closest to the round tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Interactions are mainly hydrophobic, with salt bridges between pIX and pVII subunits, and hydrogen bonds between pIX and pVIII subunits, adding further stability to the tip structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Further copies of the main capsid protein pVIII continue to coat the rounded tip in two further layers (layers 2-3), interacting with the pIX helices by mostly hydrophobic interactions.</p><p id="P21">The presence of the major capsid protein pVIII in the round tip means that the few first layers of pVIII will make unique interactions as the round tip section transitions into the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In layer 1, pVIII interacts with pVII, pIX and neighbouring pVIII molecules. In layers 2 and 3, pVIII interacts with pIX and neighbouring pVIII molecules.

Accessibility of lipids to detergent could explain the change in phage stability; in this case explaining why Sarkosyl (with the larger head group compared to SDS) only affects the stability of the mutants with the largest truncations.

It is not clear how many copies of N2 are required to bind to the F-pilus for high-efficiency infection, but the long glycine-rich linkers between the pIII C-domain and N1-N2 could plausibly allow up to 5 molecules of pIII to clamp around the filament (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Close inspection of the F-pilus machinery reveals an intriguing similarity between the stalk structure (TrwJ), suggested to locate at the tip of the assembled F-pilus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and the pIII C-domain at the tip of f1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20A</xref>). Both are comprised of pentamers of α-helices, arranged symmetrically, with the same diameter across. When f1 binds to the tip of the F-pilus, these two structures would be directly opposed.

However, a recent high-resolution structure of the purified F-pilus assembly machinery suggests that the dimensions of the trans-envelope chamber are sufficient to accommodate the pilus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. f1 is narrower than the F-pilus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20C</xref>); it is therefore possible that phage cross the bacterial outer membrane by passing through the F-pilus machinery directly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20D</xref>). Intriguingly however, phage can infect cells without F-pili in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, albeit at 6 orders of magnitude reduced efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. It therefore cannot be excluded that the role of binding to the F-pilus is to concentrate phage at the outer membrane where crossing of the bilayer occurs by an unknown mechanism. Once the phage tip has crossed the outer membrane, the N1 domain of pIII can locate and bind to TolA, pulling the phage into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Phage must next navigate the cytoplasmic membrane. No bacterial proteins have been implicated in the process, thus it is likely also mediated by the “leading” pIII tip. It has been suggested that a conformational change occurring on N1 binding to TolA can initiate a loosening of the interactions between pIII helices in the C-terminal domain of the pointy tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In support of this, we have demonstrated that the C2 domain of pIII is essential for infection and stability of the phage particle. The L2 linker between the pIII C-terminal domain and the N1-N2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15A</xref>) would be sufficiently long (up to 14.8 nm) to allow the C2 domain to reach the TolQRA complex in the cytoplasmic membrane, even if the N1-N2 domains remain bound to their receptors, as has been predicted previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. This idea is in agreement with the fact that the distance between the N1-N2 domains and the C-domain must be maintained for high levels of infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. It could therefore be envisaged that the pentameric helices of the pIII C domain (most of C1 and C2) are prised apart by binding TolA in the periplasm, so exposing the hydrophobic pVI pentamer (Supplementary movie 6). The flexible L4 linker between the M and C2 domains of pIII could allow for a twisting out of C1 and C2 about the β-hairpin loop (H1) relative to the transmembrane helix (M domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Without pIII surrounding pVI and stabilising it, the hydrophobic regions of pVI would become exposed, causing pVI to revert to its 4-helix form and insert into the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, Supplementary movie 6). The loss of extended pVI would alter the binding partners of the remainder of pIII (up to the β-hairpin structure), now revealing the C-terminal M domain of pIII. This idea is consistent with the fact that pIII has been shown to form a pore in liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and Alphafold predicts the pVI pentamer, and also a pentameric pIII / pVI complex, as channels with sufficient dimension to accommodate DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21A-C</xref>). It is interesting to note that the open state tip complex is reminiscent of the family of pentameric ligand gated ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. These are also pentamers of transmembrane α-helices, with an extracellular domain containing a distinctive cysteine-loop motif, like pIII. When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain of the ion channels, a conformational change occurs, causing the helices to move apart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. It is therefore plausible that a similar mechanism of channel opening allows a pore of pVI and the M domain of pIII to open, allowing injection of DNA into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P35">The major capsid protein pVIII is inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane on infection.

The two termini of pVIII have clear opposing charges, with the N-terminus being mostly negative, and the C-terminus highly positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10D</xref>). After opening of the pointy tip, the pVIII charge distribution would thus aid insertion of each helix into the bilayer, via detachment from the main body of the phage and lateral diffusion into the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Finally, the terminal pVII and pIX round cap would reach the cytoplasmic membrane, where they would also diffuse laterally into the bilayer due to the presence of a hydrophobic segment each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P36">All of the phage capsid proteins are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane prior to assembly. It is therefore likely that the conformational changes needed for assembly of proteins into the phage will be similar to the reverse of those occurring during infection. Phage assembly requires energy provided by the pI component of the pI / pXI complex (an ATPase), and a proton motive force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The DNA first is packaged by a phage encoded protein called pV, which wraps around the DNA in a rod of dimers, leaving the packaging signal hairpin exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). pV targets the DNA-protein complex to the pI / pXI ring-shaped multimer in the cytoplasmic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> where the packaging signal hairpin is thought to act as a signal for replacement of pV by the pVII / pIX round cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).

For the virion to be released from the cells, the M domain of pIII will need to be extracted from the membrane, together with pVI, for assembly into the phage particle.

The total dose was 40 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup> at a magnification of 81 kx, corresponding to a pixel size of 1.10 Å (0.55 Å super-resolution).

Multiple rounds of 2D classification were used to separate the tips, followed by 3D classification. A total of 86,242 particles of the pointy tip and 255,372 particles of the round tip were selected for final refinement. Iterative 3D refinements and CTF refinements were run for both tips, resulting in resolutions of 2.97 Å and 2.81 Å for the pointy and rounded tips respectively (FSC = 0.143).</p><p id="P47">To process the central filament, cryoSPARC was used for the motion correction and CTF estimation. The filament tracer tool was used to pick the particles, with an inter-particle spacing of <sup>~</sup>29 Å. A total of 13,430,601 particles were picked, extracted and processed using 2D classification. A total of 1,201,228 particles were selected and used for further refinement. Helical parameters were determined using data from the initial Talos dataset. An initial helical refinement with no symmetry or helical parameters was run and used as a reference for a second refinement with C5 symmetry and no helical parameters. From this map, helical parameters were predicted using the symmetry search tool. The resulting rise and twist values predicted were 16.56 Å and 37.41 degrees respectively. Helical refinements were performed on the Krios dataset using these values as a starting point, with CTF refinement and additional 2D classification performed. The final map achieved a resolution of 2.58 Å using 1,139,813 particles, with helical rise and twist values of 16.599 A and 37.437 degrees respectively, and C5 symmetry applied.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Modelling</title><p id="P48">The system of amino acid numbering used throughout is for the mature protein sequences of pIII and pVIII (ie the sequences are numbered from 1 after their signal sequences have been removed). A fibre diffraction structure of fd phage pVIII protein (PDB:2C0W)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> was first manually placed in the filamentous cryoEM map using UCSF ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Proteins pIII and pVI were easily distinguished from each other on the basis of their length, and were initially built into the pointy density map as poly-Ala chains using Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> and then their sequences assigned manually. Proteins pVII and pIX were harder to distinguish on the basis of their length, they were also initially built as poly-Ala helices in the round map and their sequences assigned manually. For all three structures, bulky residues, glycine residues and unique sequence patterns were used to guide sequence assignment during model building. Model building and adjustments were performed using Coot, and the monomeric structures refined using Refmac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> from the CCPEM suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. 5-fold and helical symmetry were applied using ChimeraX, and the three complete structures refined again with Refmac.

body of the phage, and the protein pairs pIII (orange/pale pink) and pVI (purple), and pVII (bright pink) and pIX (yellow) that form the tips. For clarity, only three pIII / pVI proteins and one each of pVII / pIX are shown, instead of five of each. pIII binds to the F-pilus (green), which retracts, ultimately allowing phage to reach the TolQRA complex anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane (shades of pink). After DNA injection and genome replication, phage proteins are expressed and assembled. pI / pXI (shades of brown) in the cytoplasmic membrane are dependent on the proton-motive force and ATP hydrolysis by pI. pI / pXI interact with pIV in the outer membrane (mauve), which allows egress across the outer membrane.</p><p>(B) Schematic to show the f1 capsid proteins and their domains.

Hydrogen bonds within the different layers are depicted with blue dashed lines.</p><p>(A) Left, 10 helices of alternating pIX and pVIII line the outside of the pVII bundle with pentameric layers of pVIII. ln layer 1, Interactions are mainly hydrophobic, with salt bridges between pIX and pVII (Glu 29 to Arg 33), and hydrogen bonds between pIX and pVIII (Thr 30 to Lys 43, and Glu 29 to Lys 40). In layers 2-3, pVIII interacts with pIX and neighbouring pVIII molecules via hydrophobic interactions. The pVIII in layer 4 onwards interacts with other pVIII molecules only, again via hydrophobic interactions and with inter-subunit hydrogen bonds between Lys 43 and Lys 48, and Ser 47 and Lys 40 at the C-termini.</p><p>(B) Left, pentameric layers of pVIII occur at the pointy tip. In layer 1, pVIII interacts with pIII, pVI and neighbouring pVIII molecules, forming hydrogen bonds between Tyr 24 and Lys 363 of pIII, and between Lys 44 and Ser 50 of a neighbouring pVIII from layer 2. In layer 2 pVIII forms hydrogen bonds from Lys 43 to Lys 48 of neighbouring pVIII molecules from layer 3, and in layer 4 onwards, pVIII interacts with other pVIII molecules only, with hydrogen bonds between Lys 43 and Lys 48 from adjacent layers.</p><p>(C) Composite models of the f1-derived nanorod (top) and WT f1 phage (bottom) were generated by aligning the pointy and round tips with multiple copies of the pVIII filament protein and an Alphafold model of the N1-N2 domains of pIII. The f1-derived nanorod contains <sup>~</sup>230 copies of pVIII, and WT phage <sup>~</sup>2,700 copies. pVII is shown in pink, pIX in yellow, pIII in orange, pVI in purple and pVIII in pale blue.

WT phage contains <sup>~</sup>2,700 copies, so would be <sup>~</sup>42x longer than the phage shown. pVII is shown in pink, pIX in yellow, pIII in orange, pVI in purple and pVIII in pale blue. One of the N1 domains in pIII is highlighted in teal, with its corresponding N2 domain in light pink.</p><p>(A) Model for infection with (B) domains of pIII highlighted. (1) The N2 domain of pIII binds to the F-pilus and unfolds the N1-N2 hinge to expose the TolA binding site on N1. It is not clear how many N2 domains are needed to bind to the F-pilus for high-efficiency infection. (2) The freed N1 domain of pIII binds to the TolQRA complex. Only one N1-N2 domain is shown for clarity. (3) The C1 and C2 domains of pIII start to move away from the body of the phage at the H1 β-hairpin loop due to flexibility in the L4 linker (B). The N1-N2 domains are not shown for clarity, but could remain bound to TolQRA. (4) Complete opening of the C domain of pIII exposes the hydrophobic pVI pentamer. (5) The exposed hydrophobic regions of pVI insert into the membrane, also allowing insertion of the now exposed pIII transmembrane (M) domain. (6) The pore formed by a pentamer of pIII and a pentamer of pVI allows injection of DNA into the cytoplasm. (7) The first layer of pVIII is exposed on loss of the pointy tip, and proteins move laterally into the bilayer due to opposing charge on the N and C-termini. This reveals the second layer of pVIII, and the process continues.</p><p>(C) Model for phage assembly and egress with (B) domains of pIII highlighted. (8) ssDNA is packaged by pV, leaving the packaging signal hairpin exposed (green). (9) pV targets the DNA-protein complex to pI / pXI, where pV is replaced by the pVII / pIX round cap. Displacement of pV allows pVIII to diffuse laterally around the DNA. (10) ATP hydrolysis by pI / pXI drives growth of the filament with continuous addition of pVIII. (11) On reaching the terminus of DNA, pI / pXI undergo a conformational change which increases their affinity for the pIII / pVI cap, which form a membrane-bound complex (12). (13) The L4 linker closes around the body of the phage at the H1 β-hairpin loop (B) and the C domain of pIII folds down over the hydrophobic helices of pVI to secede the phage from the cytoplasmic membrane. (14) Phage passes through the pIV secretin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> in the outer membrane and is released.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156684-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
