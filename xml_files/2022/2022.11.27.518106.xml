Identifying biologic and genetic effects on DNA methylation (DNAm) in endometrium increases understanding of mechanisms that influence gene regulation predisposing to endometriosis and offers an opportunity for novel therapeutic target discovery. Herein, we characterize variation in endometrial DNAm and its association with menstrual cycle phase, endometriosis, and genetic variants through analysis of genome-wide genotype data and methylation at 759,345 DNAm sites in endometrial samples from 984 deeply-phenotyped participants. We identify significant differences in DNAm profiles between menstrual cycle phases and at four DNAm sites between stage III/IV endometriosis and controls. We estimate that 15.4% of the variation in endometriosis is captured by DNAm, and identify DNAm networks associated with endometriosis. DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis identified 118,185 independent <italic>cis</italic>-mQTL including some tissue-specific effects. We find significant differences in DNAm profiles between endometriosis sub-phenotypes and a significant association between genetic regulation of methylation in endometrium and disease risk, providing functional evidence for genomic targets contributing to endometriosis risk and pathogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Endometriosis is a common, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disorder defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue at extra-uterine (ectopic) sites, commonly within the pelvis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. It is associated with pain and infertility, affects an estimates 190 million women and contributes hundreds of billions of dollars to healthcare costs globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

Disease classification is based primarily on lesion appearance and location without correlation to symptoms or responses to surgical and hormonal therapies, and molecular classifications of disease subtypes are wanting. Although mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this heterogeneous disorder are largely unknown, studies suggest that diverse endometrial cellular components of women with disease respond abnormally to cyclic steroid hormones and exhibit aberrant signaling pathways, gene expression, decreased apoptosis, enhanced proliferation, and an inflammatory phenotype as compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

Endometrial whole methylome and candidate gene DNAm profiles in bulk tissue and select cell populations identify genes involved with steroid hormone dependence and abnormalities in women with versus without endometriosis.

Both studies determined that menstrual cycle phase accounted for the majority of variability in DNAm patterns within the endometrium. Estradiol, progesterone, and their combination were found to regulate genome-wide DNAm signatures and gene transcription in endometrial stromal fibroblasts isolated from 8 women with endometriosis (4 with stage I/II and 4 with stage III/IV disease) and 7 women without endometriosis, with marked aberrances in endometriosis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

Menstrual cycle stage is a major source of variation in DNAm in endometrium – providing strong support for hormonally-driven differences in DNAm across the cycle being associated with known changes in gene expression and pathways responsible for endometrial physiology, function, and dysfunction. We found no evidence for large site-specific DNAm differences between endometriosis cases and controls. However, correlated network analysis identified networks of DNAm signals relevant to disease pathophysiology that differed between disease and control. We also report novel and disease-associated genetic effects on DNAm in endometrium that provide new insights into epigenetic regulation of pathways important for endometrial biology and identify target genes with a potential role in the causal pathway between genetic variation and endometriosis pathogenesis. Functional validation of these genomic targets may yield new therapeutic targets with the potential to disrupt pathogenic processes. Possible differences in DNAm associated with disease sub-phenotypes highlights the need to generate larger datasets with sample collection timed with menstrual cycle phase and comprehensive clinical information. Validation of methylation profiles associated with sub-phenotypes of disease may also allow molecular subtyping of disease that can be associated with patient outcomes to guide personalized disease management.

Summary statistics used were generated from a subset of European cohorts from the largest endometriosis GWA meta-analysis to date conducted by Rahmioglu, et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> with the addition of a FinnGen endometriosis cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 17</xref>). Datasets that were used in generation of the mQTL analysis (ENDOX, Melbourne, UCSF) were not included in the meta-analysis to ensure independent datasets. SMR was run for overall endometriosis (31,021 cases and 524,422 controls) and stage III/IV endometriosis (8,765 cases and 373,626 controls) separately. Of note, controls in the GWA meta-analysis were population controls who did not have documentation of endometriosis diagnosis. The HEIDI (Heterogeneity In Dependent Instruments) test was also conducted to distinguish independent overlapping signals and pleiotropy/causal associations. Associations with an SMR p-value of <italic>P</italic><sub>SMR</sub> &lt;0.05/(number of DNAm sites tested) and a HEIDI p-value of <italic>P</italic><sub>HEIDI</sub> &gt;0.05/(number of genes passing the SMR test) was applied as the threshold for statistical significance.</p><p id="P62">Consistent association signals at genomic loci across multiple omics layers can help identify functionally relevant genes and regulatory elements.

We combined results from pleiotropic associations between DNAm, gene expression and endometriosis using the stringent criterion that both the DNAm site and gene of each pair were statistically significantly associated with endometriosis at a genome-wide threshold with no association rejected by the HEIDI test. The gene–endometriosis association analysis was not dependent on the DNAm–endometriosis association analysis to account for potential discrepancies in SNPs tagging the causal SNP between the datasets.</p><p id="P63">Association between SNPs significant in the SMR analyses and other traits and diseases was investigated using PhenoScanner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref></sup> and GWAS Catalog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>. EpiMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> was also used to functionally annotate SMR significant SNPs and DNAm sites using epigenome maps from relevant tissues (uterus, ovary, vagina, mammary/breast epithelium, mammary/breast fibroblasts, skin epithelium, skin fibroblasts, Ishikawa cells, T47D cells) to define chromatin states, high-resolution enhancers, enhancer modules, upstream regulators and downstream target genes. Valid promoter associated chromatin loops generated from H3K27Ac HiChIP libraries from a normal immortalized endometrial cell line (E6E7hTERT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> were also used to annotate SNPs and DNAm sites located in chromatin interaction anchor points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Estimation of variance captured by genetics and DNAm in endometrium</title><p id="P64">Genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML), as implemented in the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref></sup>, was used to estimate the variation in endometriosis case-control status captured by common genetic variants (SNPs), also known as the SNP-based heritability. The genetic relationship matrix (GRM) used in the GREML analysis was calculated using genotype data for 5,358,309 SNPs in 953 individuals in GCTA. Similarly, omics residual maximum likelihood analyses (OREML), as implemented in the Omic-data-based Complex Trait Analysis (OSCA) software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, was used to estimate the proportion of variance in endometriosis case-control status captured by DNAm sites and SNPs. Three different OREML models were compared, one including all DNAm sites (n=759,345) for 984 individuals in the form of an omics relationship matrix (ORM), one including the ORM and the GRM for 953 individuals with matched genetic and DNAm data and one including the ORM, calculated following exclusion of DNAm sites with mQTLs (n=651,718), and the GRM for the 953 individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Targeted differential DNAm analysis investigating associations with endometriosis surgically visualized and endometriosis-associated symptom sub-phenotypes</title><p id="P65">Differential DNAm analysis for 11,698 DNAm sites within 500Kb± of 44 lead SNPs genome-wide statistically significantly associated with endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> was conducted for 11 comparisons of endometriosis-case-specific surgical sub-phenotypes (rASRM stage I/II disease, stage III/IV disease; presence of at least one superficial peritoneal lesion, endometrioma, or deep lesion; presence of at least one each of superficial peritoneal, endometrioma, and deep lesions) and 6 comparisons of common endometriosis-associated pain symptom sub-phenotypes (dyspareunia, acyclic pelvic pain, dyschezia) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 15</xref> for detailed descriptions). These comparisons were restricted to NUPP controls. Only 10% of cases and NUPP controls reported no dysmenorrhea (cyclic pain with menses), and therefore we could not investigate presence or absence of dysmenorrhea as an independent sub-phenotype. In the differential DNAm analysis, post-QC M-values from the DNAm data were utilized as described in the overall endometriosis genome-wide differential DNAm analysis methods above. Differential DNAm analysis was conducted using the Limma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup> R package. For each sub-phenotype analysis, an independent set of SVs was generated and included in the models. Both a genome-wide Bonferroni multiple testing correction (p &lt; 4.27x10<sup>-6</sup>) and a less stringent locus-specific Bonferroni multiple testing correction (0.05/N of DNAm sites per GWAS locus) was applied. The statistically significantly differentially methylated sites were checked in the endometrium mQTL map and SMR results generated as described in the previous section. If an mQTL was identified for a differentially methylated probe, whether the DNAm-associated SNP was in LD with an endometriosis-associated SNP in the respective region was determined. Associated DNAm sites were also annotated using EpiMap as described in the previous section. Correlation between the effect sizes of differentially methylated sites between subtypes were calculated utilizing Spearman’s rank correlations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS157788-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS157788-supplement-Supplementary_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d31aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S35"><title>Funding</title><p>This work has been supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NICHD R01 HD089511.
