When such cotranslational assembly occurs for homomeric complexes, made up of multiple copies of the same subunit, this will result in complexes whose subunits were translated off of the same mRNA in an allele-specific manner. It has therefore been hypothesised that cotranslational assembly may be able to counter the assembly-mediated dominant-negative effect, whereby the co-assembly of mutant and wild-type subunits “poison” the activity of a protein complex. Here, we address this, showing first that subunits that undergo cotranslational assembly are much less likely to be associated with autosomal dominant relative to recessive disorders. Moreover, we observe that subunits with dominant-negative disease mutations are significantly depleted in cotranslational assembly compared to those associated with loss-of-function mutations. Consistent with this, we also find that complexes with known dominant-negative effects tend to expose their interfaces late during translation, lessening the likelihood of cotranslational assembly. Finally, by combining protein complex properties with other protein-level features, we trained a computational model for predicting proteins likely to be associated with dominant-negative or gain-of-function molecular mechanisms, which we believe will be of considerable utility for protein variant interpretation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Almost half of the proteins with experimentally determined structures interact with other copies of themselves to form homomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergendahl and Marsh 2017</xref>), and more than one-third of heteromeric complexes with known structures contain sequence-identical repeated subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Marsh et al. 2015</xref>). Considering the human proteome, about one-fifth of proteins have been detected to cotranslationally assemble in a simultaneous fashion (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>), whereby two subunits interact while still being translated on the ribosome. Cotranslationally assembling homomers are thought to predominantly undergo cis-assembly, yielding allele-specific complexes (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Gilmore et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Redick and Schwarzbauer 1995</xref>). Repeated subunits in a heteromeric complex are also more likely to have come from the same transcript, especially when their assembly is seeded by cotranslational assembly, which reduces the chance of a single complex containing subunits from two alleles. We are beginning to understand which structural properties are important for or predispose subunits to undergo this mode of assembly. Thus far, these include N-terminally exposed interface residues (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Kamenova et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Natan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Shiber et al. 2018</xref>), a large interface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>), a high alpha helix content and presence of coiled coil motifs (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>) or domain invasion motifs (<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Seidel et al. 2022</xref>). Although many studies have provided insight into the functional and evolutionary aspects of cotranslational assembly, our understanding of the genetic impact of its allele-specific nature is lacking.</p><p id="P3">Previously, a potential genetic consequence was proposed on theoretical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Natan et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Nicholls et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Perica et al. 2012</xref>). According to the hypothesis, cotranslational assembly should reduce the likelihood that a dominant-negative (DN) mechanism of disease pathogenesis will be observed. A DN effect occurs when expression of a mutant allele disrupts the activity of the wild-type allele (Herskowitz, 1987; Veitia et al., 2018), causing disproportionate function loss and thus a dominant mode of inheritance. Observational evidence has long suggested that DN effects are common in homomers (Veitia, 2007), most probably because incorporation of a mutant subunit into a complex along with wild-type subunits is enough to “poison” the complex. This assembly-mediated DN effect can lead to a reduction in functional activity exceeding the 50% that would be expected for a simple heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutation. However, cotranslational assembly can give rise to complexes whose subunits are allele specific, i.e. homogenous wild-type or homogenous mutant, potentially buffering the deleterious effect of an otherwise DN mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This ability of cotranslational assembly can be referred to as its “buffering capacity” against DN mutations.</p><p id="P4">Two molecular phenomena may complicate the detectability of such buffering capacity. First, peri-translational assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Natan et al., 2017</xref>) should make it more likely that post-translationally assembling subunits will also be allele specific, providing that the rate of subunit synthesis outpaces the diffusional force driving the subunit away from the transcript. This effect is likely to be more common in highly abundant proteins, whose transcripts have high ribosome densities and are translated more efficiently than those of lowly abundant proteins (Riba et al., 2019; Schwanhäusser et al., 2011). Second, the phenomenon of subunit exchange (Tusk et al., 2018) may increase the entropy of subunit stoichiometry post-assembly via shuffling of wild-type and mutant subunits, resulting in proportions expected from random post-translational assembly. However, because proneness to subunit exchange is determined by the dissociation constants of the subunits involved, it should be less likely to occur between cotranslationally assembling subunit pairs, which tend to have larger interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>) and thus higher binding affinities.</p><p id="P5">Heterozygous mutations in genes associated with both recessive and dominant disorders are expected to be enriched in DN mechanisms. First, DN mutations in recessive genes often lead to disease that phenocopy the recessive disorder, as is the case with missense variants in the inositol triphosphate receptor (ITPR1) implicated in Gillespie syndrome (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">McEntagart et al. 2016</xref>) or those in the retinoid isomerohydrolase (RPE65) linked to retinitis pigmentosa (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Bowne et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2002</xref>). Second, recessivity is an indication that the product of the gene is haplosufficient, i.e. half the gene dose upon a heterozygous null mutation is sufficient to maintain the normal phenotype. Exceptions may be cases where the recessive mutation is hypomorphic, that is, partial LOF, and ultimately results in suboptimal amounts of the protein.</p><p id="P6">Closely related to the DN effect is a special case of gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. At the protein-level, the phenotypic effect of GOF mutations is the consequence of the mutant protein doing something differently than the wild-type protein, although there is ambiguity in the literature around how this is interpreted. A simple case of GOF is the S810L mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which leads to early-onset hypertension as a result of certain steroid antagonists becoming potent agonists (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Geller et al. 2000</xref>). However, formation of mixed wild-type:mutant complexes can lead to GOF in a similar manner to the DN effect, but instead of the mutant blocking the activity of the wild-type, the GOF is conferred to the whole complex. This is the case with the L171R mutation in the G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (KCNJ6) implicated in the Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome, which acts by reducing potassium selectivity allowing sodium and calcium ions to pass the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Horvath et al. 2018</xref>). The precise terminology for this mechanism is the assembly-mediated dominant-positive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Backwell and Marsh 2022</xref>), which, similar to the assembly-mediated DN effect, may also be subject to genetic buffering by allele-specific assembly.</p><p id="P7">All things considered, cotranslational assembly may counter the DN effect, which can have an appreciable impact on how genes with inherited and <italic>de novo</italic> missense variants are prioritised in clinical sequencing pipelines. To examine the question, we used a set of cotranslationally assembling proteins determined by disome-selective ribosome profiling (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al., 2021</xref>) and formulated two hypotheses based upon the above lines of thought: 1) Using dominant disease inheritance as a proxy for the DN effect, homomers and repeated subunits with an autosomal dominant disease inheritance pattern should be depleted in cotranslationally assembly relative to autosomal recessive genes; and that 2) within genes with autosomal dominant inheritance, protein subunits with known DN disease mutations should have the lowest rate of cotranslational assembly. Here, we show that both hypotheses are upheld. Moreover, examination of the structural properties of complexes associated with DN mutations shows that their interfaces are exposed relatively late during translation, which should strongly disfavour cotranslational assembly. Finally, using a knowledge-based approach, we train a regression model to prioritise genes whose mutations are expected to be associated with non-LOF mechanisms. We hope that our work will be of interest to clinical geneticists and accelerate the prediction and discovery of variant-level molecular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Autosomal dominant genes are depleted in cotranslationally assembling subunits</title><p id="P8">We start with a set of 9,053 human proteins, of which 6,562 (72%) physically interact with copies of themselves to form homomeric complexes. The remaining 2,491 (28%) are repeated subunits, meaning that they are present in heteromeric complexes in more than one copy. Both types of proteins have the potential to be associated with assembly-mediated DN or dominant-positive effects, as the mutant and wild-type proteins can co-assemble within the same complex. We obtained genetic inheritance modes from the OMIM database (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Amberger et al. 2015</xref>) and defined a gene as autosomal dominant (AD) if it had disease mutations inherited in an AD pattern or as autosomal recessive (AR) if it had mutations inherited exclusively in an AR pattern.</p><p id="P9">An example of a homomer that causes autosomal dominant disease is the ferritin light chain (FTL) complex, which stores and transports iron in a readily available form. Numerous mutations in the <italic>FTL</italic> gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders associated with iron accumulation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Curtis et al. 2001</xref>). The frameshift mutation F167SfsX26 in particular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) replaces a C-terminal short helix with a stretch of disordered residues, which is thought to have a DN effect by creating large pores in the complex that interfere with its ability to store iron as a solid mineral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Jin et al. 2001</xref>). An example of a repeated subunit is found in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), with both the alpha-1 (GABRA1) and beta-2 (GABRB2) subunits being present in two copies in the complex, an important ionotropic receptor of the central nervous system. The mutation T287P is located in the second transmembrane helix of GABRB2 that forms the inner lining of the channel. It has been proposed that the mutation exerts a DN effect by interfering with the trafficking of the wild-type and reducing the chloride ion current upon activation, ultimately contributing to a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ishii et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Our first hypothesis was that AD genes encoding proteins that assemble into homomers or repeated subunits of heteromers should be depleted in cotranslational assembly relative to AR genes, because subunits with DN mutations should be less likely to undergo cotranslational assembly. While we acknowledge that using AD inheritance as a proxy for the DN effect is a strong simplification, we expect that assembly-mediated DN and dominant-positive effects account for a substantial fraction of AD disorders in these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bergendahl et al. 2019</xref>). We found that 24% of AD subunits cotranslationally assemble compared to 35.6% with an AR inheritance (p = 2 × 10<sup>-10</sup>; hypergeometric test). As a measure of the strength of the relative difference between AD and AR groups, we calculated the odds ratio (OR). To put OR into context using the overall trend, OR = 0.57 can be interpreted as a randomly selected AD homomer or repeated subunit being almost half as likely to cotranslationally assemble as a randomly selected AR subunit. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, we show this analysis grouped by the three main sources of the subunit data, which are homomers with experimentally characterised structures (PDB homomers), homomers with non-structural evidence (other, which includes SWISS-MODEL homology models and evidence for homo-oligomerisation from different databases), and repeated subunits of heteromers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). The results show that PDB homomers exhibit the strongest effect (OR = 0.46, p = 7.5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) followed by repeated subunits (OR = 0.6, p = 4.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and other homomers (OR = 0.61, p = 1.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). We speculate that the stronger trend in PDB homomers is due to their enrichment in biologically important homomeric interfaces, which makes a higher fraction of this group amenable to the buffering of assembly-mediated effects. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that, despite a small variation in effect size, the trend is homogenous across the groups.</p><p id="P11">We considered a range of confounding variables. Both cotranslational assembly and its detection may be biased by abundance because highly abundant proteins tend to have a higher ribosome density (Riba et al., 2019), which facilitates cotranslational assembly as well as yields more ribosome footprints that can be subjected to sequencing. Notably, AD and AR homomers and repeated subunits have similar median abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1A</xref>, p = 0.658; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). We binned subunits based upon their approximate intracellular concentration into quartiles, ranging from ∼0.005 nanomolar to ∼180 micromolar, and visualised the differences in the level of cotranslational assembly between AD and AR subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Whilst the trend appears strongest in the bin of highest abundance (top 25%, OR = 0.43, p = 3.2 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), it is significant across all quartiles. Because the detection of cotranslationally assembling proteins was performed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>), we repeated the analysis using active ribosome-protected fragment counts specific to HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Clamer et al. 2018</xref>), which mirrored the results from the abundance analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1B</xref>). Protein length should also be controlled for because AD homomers and repeated subunits are significantly longer than AR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1C</xref>, p = 7.1 × 10<sup>-10</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Using the same approach, we split the subunits by their length into four quartiles and found that all four bins follow the trend to a statistically significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Homomers assemble into symmetric complexes and each symmetry group is associated with unique structural and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergendahl and Marsh 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Goodsell and Olson 2000</xref>). The three most common symmetry groups in the human proteome are twofold symmetry (Schönflies notation, <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub>), higher-order cyclic symmetry (<italic>C</italic><sub>n&gt;2</sub>), and dihedral symmetry (<italic>D</italic><sub>n&gt;1</sub>). Members of the cyclic symmetry group frequently form pores in biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Forrest 2015</xref>), and because their subunits collectively contribute to function such as ion transport, they are prone to be afflicted by dominant mutations in their genes. Indeed, the fraction of AD genes is significantly higher in complexes with cyclic symmetry compared to those with twofold or dihedral symmetry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1D</xref>). By contrast, the dihedral symmetry group is enriched in metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergendahl and Marsh 2017</xref>), which are often tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations owing to the law of diminishing returns in metabolic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kacser and Burns 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wright 1934</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We have previously shown that cotranslationally assembling members of the different symmetry groups tend to have larger interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>), but they also differ in their level of cotranslational assembly, with members of the cyclic group being the least likely to cotranslationally assemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1E</xref>). When we subset AD and AR homomers based upon their symmetry group, we find a relatively large variation in the level of cotranslational assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1F</xref>). A randomly selected cyclic complex with AD inheritance is four times less likely to cotranslationally assemble than an AR cyclic complex (OR = 0.24, p = 9.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), while a dihedral complex with AD inheritance is only half as likely (OR = 0.51, p = 0.045). Rare symmetries, such as helical and cubic, as well as asymmetric homomers, were grouped into the “other” category due to their relatively low representation in the human proteome. We did not detect a significant trend in this group, which may have to do with the heterogeneous properties of the complexes associated with those symmetries. For example, torsin-A is a chaperone involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and it forms a helical complex with 8.5 subunits per turn (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Demircioglu et al. 2019</xref>). The DN mutation E303del in torsin-A results in the deletion of a glutamate near the C terminus involved in early-onset torsion dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Torres et al. 2004</xref>). Because complexes with helical symmetry are topologically open, they would undergo unlimited polymerisation under ideal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Marsh and Teichmann 2015</xref>). Despite torsin-A having been detected to cotranslationally assemble (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>), the large number of subunits and the nature of fibre assembly will likely render it susceptible to the DN effect, analogous to tubulin subunits that make up helical microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Attard, Welburn, and Marsh 2022</xref>). This contrasts with comparably large complexes with a closed topology that could benefit from cotranslational assembly, such as the dihedral (D<sub>39</sub>) major vault protein, which has been observed to be readily assembled by the polyribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Mrazek et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Coiled coil motifs were found to be highly enriched among cotranslationally assembling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that cotranslationally assembling homomers and repeated subunits are significantly enriched in alpha helices (effect size = 0.161, p = 1.5 × 10<sup>-52</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and this enrichment is similar in effect after coiled coil motif containing proteins are removed from the data (effect size = 0.155, p = 9.6 × 10<sup>-44</sup>). We therefore controlled for alpha helix content as a potential confounder by binning the subunits into four quartiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1G</xref>). The results indicate that the trend remains consistent across the bins, although lacks statistical significance for the bin with the lowest amount of helix content.</p><p id="P15">Bertolini <italic>et al</italic>. have provided confidence-based classification for the cotranslationally assembling protein candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>). While the exclusive use of high confidence proteins is prohibitive to the analysis, as they comprise only one-fifth of all detected proteins, we controlled for its potential confounding effect by splitting the subunits into high and low confidence groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1H</xref>). The high confidence group excludes all low confidence proteins, and similarly, the low confidence group excludes high confidence proteins altogether. We found that the level of cotranslational assembly is significantly lower in AD relative to AR subunits in both high (OR = 0.66, p = 7.7 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and low confidence groups (OR = 0.55, p = 5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>). Because, by design, high confidence candidates are exclusively cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins, one possible explanation to why the trend is stronger in the low confidence subset is that they are enriched in membrane-bound complexes that commonly adopt a cyclic symmetry, which demonstrates the strongest buffering capacity among the main symmetry groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We also analysed the level of cotranslational assembly in the subset of AD genes that are also associated with AR disorders (AD/AR). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, we show that AD/AR genes of homomers and repeated subunit heteromers are more strongly depleted in cotranslational assembly relative to AR (OR = 0.49, p = 1.4 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; Holm-Bonferroni corrected hypergeometric test) than the AD group (OR = 0.61, p = 3.7 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Because, as mentioned earlier, dominant mutations in mixed AD/AR subunits often phenocopy the recessive disorder, they are thought to be enriched in assembly-mediated DN and dominant-positive effects, which are more likely to come about in the absence of cotranslational assembly.</p><p id="P17">Finally, we considered genetic dominance of mutations in genes located on autosomes and on the X chromosome. Genes on autosomes are normally present in two copies, one allele on each chromosome, corresponding to the diploid homo- or heterozygous states. Genes on the X chromosome are hemizygous in males, meaning that only one allele is present at all times. In females, the second allele is generally silenced with the exception of a subset of genes that escape the inactivation process in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Tukiainen et al. 2017</xref>). Consequently, cotranslational assembly should have no capacity to buffer X-linked dominance, since there is not a wild-type allele whose transcript could ameliorate the phenotype. In accordance with this idea, genes of homomers and repeated subunits that cause disease via an X-linked dominant pattern do not appear to have lower levels of cotranslational assembly than their X-linked recessive counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1I</xref>, OR = 1.06, p = 0.639).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Subunits with dominant-negative disease mutations are less likely to cotranslationally assemble than subunits with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations</title><p id="P18">Given that the fraction of cotranslationally assembling homomers and repeated subunits is lower in AD relative to AR genes, we sought to identify which molecular mechanism in the AD inheritance mode is responsible for the trend. Dominant molecular mechanisms by which mutations cause disease at the protein-level can be broadly classified into three groups: heterozygous loss of function (LOF, or haploinsufficiency), gain of function (GOF), and dominant negative (DN). Because DN mutations adversely affect the function of the wild type allele, we hypothesised that subunits with DN disease mutations should be depleted in cotranslational assembly relative to genes with LOF mutations that inactivate one allele without affecting the wild type. This is because cotranslational assembly should reduce the mixing that occurs between the wild-type and mutant subunits, which in turn should make it less likely that the assembled complex will exhibit a disproportionate loss-of-function, i.e. a DN phenotype.</p><p id="P19">To start with, we classified 66% of AD genes (n = 1,185; available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) into LOF, GOF, and DN molecular mechanisms using text-mining approaches and manual curation of the corresponding evidence (detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). To ascertain that the gene sets are suitable for analysis, we have looked at properties known to be associated with the different molecular mechanisms. These include the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔΔG) upon pathogenic mutations and the extent to which the mutations cluster in 3D space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gerasimavicius, Livesey, and Marsh 2022</xref>). It was first observed in a subset of membrane proteins that DN mutations tend to have low (predicted) ΔΔG values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">McEntagart et al. 2016</xref>). This may be explained by the idea that non-LOF mutations should generally permit at least the partial folding of the subunit and so they tend to have a mild impact on the structure. Conversely, LOF mutations inactivate the protein, which frequently happens when protein interior residues are involved whose mutations are considerably more structurally damaging. In agreement with this, we found that disease mutations in homomers and repeated subunits of the DN class have significantly lower predicted ΔΔG compared to LOF subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2A</xref>, p = 1.3 × 10<sup>-16</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In terms of 3D clustering, non-LOF mutations are often concentrated in specific regions of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Lelieveld et al. 2017</xref>), such as interfaces and functional sites, while LOF mutations tend be uniformly distributed across the structure. Consistent with this, disease mutations of DN homomers and repeated subunits in our dataset exhibit a higher degree of 3D clustering than LOF subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2B</xref>, p = 4.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), with a strong tendency to be enriched at homomeric interfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2C</xref>, p = 1.3 × 10<sup>-18</sup>; hypergeometric test).</p><p id="P20">We next directly addressed our hypothesis by calculating the fraction of cotranslationally assembling subunits in each molecular mechanism group, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found the fraction to be markedly lower among DN (20.9%) compared to LOF subunits (32.4%, OR = 0.55, p = 1.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, hypergeometric test) and AR subunits (35.6%, OR = 0.49, p = 6.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). At the molecular level, AR and heterozygous LOF mutations are very similar in their effect. Recessive disorders are almost always due to biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) loss of function, with a few rare examples of biallelic gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cavaco et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Drutman et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Wishner et al. 1975</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that the level of cotranslational assembly in subunits with monoallelic and biallelic LOF mutations is similar, but subunits with DN mutations are observed to cotranslationally assemble less frequently. Therefore, allele-specific protein complex assembly may prevent some mutations from the clinical manifestation of a phenotype caused by certain heterozygous variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Further indication that mutations in genes with both dominant and recessive inheritance are strongly associated with assembly mediated effects is borne out in the molecular mechanism classifications, with the DN class having the highest fraction of genes with mixed inheritance (36.6%) followed by GOF (29.2%) and then LOF (17.8%). When LOF genes are removed from the AD/AR set to allow for a non-redundant comparison, the fraction of AD/AR genes that cotranslationally assemble is 18.4%, which is significantly less than the 32.4% measured in the LOF class (OR = 0.47, p = 2.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; hypergeometric test). Furthermore, we observe the GOF class to be depleted in cotranslational assembly relative to LOF, although not to a statistically significant extent (26.5% vs 32.4%, p = 0.11). We speculate that this observation is driven by the enrichment of the GOF class in the assembly-mediated dominant-positive effect, which is subject to genetic buffering by allele-specific assembly. We also noticed that GOF homomers more frequently assemble into cyclic complexes relative to the LOF class (21.3% vs 6.4%, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; Fisher’s exact test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2D</xref>), the symmetry group with the lowest fraction of cotranslationally assembling members (18.4% compared to 27.3% in twofold homodimers and 31.2% in dihedral complexes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">For the above reason, we explored the potential confounding effect of structural symmetry, and found prominent symmetry group preferences among the molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2D</xref>). DN homomers, similar to the GOF homomers, are enriched in the cyclic symmetry relative to LOF (20.4% vs 6.4%, p = 4 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; Fisher’s exact test). LOF homomers frequently form <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> symmetric dimers, although their sample size does not allow for a statistically robust conclusion. Moreover, AR homomers are overrepresented in the dihedral symmetry group relative to DN homomers (12.6% vs 4.8%, p = 1.3 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; Fisher’s exact test). We suspect that these symmetry group compositions reflect biases in protein function. The inheritance and molecular mechanism of disease strongly correlate with protein function. For example, disorders caused by genes encoding enzymes are primarily recessive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Jimenez-Sanchez, Childs, and Valle 2001</xref>), genes encoding transcription factors are more likely to be haploinsufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Seidman and Seidman 2002</xref>), and those of membrane channels commonly give rise to DN and GOF mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Celesia 2001</xref>). These admittedly broad functional classes have been shown to be associated with structural properties, with metabolic enzymes being enriched in dihedral symmetry, transcription factors in twofold symmetry, and membrane channels in cyclic symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergendahl and Marsh 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Forrest 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Goodsell and Olson 2000</xref>). We used protein functional classification to investigate if the aforementioned functions are reflected in the inheritance and molecular mechanism classes, which supported the above assumptions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2E</xref>). Metabolic enzymes are overrepresented in AR subunits (AR vs all other, OR = 4.27, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-40</sup>; Holm-Bonferroni corrected Fisher’s exact test), membrane transporters among GOF and DN subunits (OR = 2.96, p = 4.8 × 10<sup>-9</sup> and OR = 1.99, p = 4.8 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively), and LOF subunits are 6.9-fold more likely to function as transcription factors than a subunit sampled randomly from the disease gene pool (OR = 6.89, p = 2.15 × 10<sup>-19</sup>).</p><p id="P23">When homomers in the different molecular mechanism classes are grouped by their symmetry, the level of cotranslational assembly is consistently lower among DN subunits and those with mixed AD/AR inheritance than LOF or AR subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2F</xref>). The only exception is the cyclic symmetry in the LOF class, where it is difficult to reliably estimate the cotranslational assembly rate because no cotranslationally assembling member was identified. Furthermore, we split the analysis into homomers and repeated subunits to examine if the trend seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> holds up for repeated subunits within the dominant molecular mechanisms. We show in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2G</xref> that strictly homomers with DN mutations are still more strongly depleted in cotranslational assembly than LOF homomers (OR = 0.44, p = 1.1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; hypergeometric test) and that repeated subunits with AD/AR inheritance are also depleted relative to AR (OR = 0.47, p = 5.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). These results demonstrate that the genetic buffering capacity of cotranslational assembly, despite evident differences in structural symmetry, is neither confounded by symmetry nor is it exclusive to homomers but includes also repeated subunits of heteromeric complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interfaces of homodimers with dominant-negative disease mutations are C-terminally shifted</title><p id="P24">How can we explain the observation that subunits with DN disease mutations are less likely to cotranslationally assemble? As previously discussed, two potential confounding variables are protein abundance and length. However, we did not find significant differences in the abundance and length distributions of homomers and repeated subunits in the dominant molecular mechanism classes that could explain the trend (Dunn’s test of multiple comparisons with Holm-Bonferroni correction, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3A-B</xref>). This suggests that there must be other properties of DN subunits that make them less likely to assemble on the ribosome. There are three reported structural features that show correspondence with cotranslational assembly: high alpha helix content, a large interface area, and an N-terminally localised interface (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Kamenova et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Natan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Shiber et al. 2018</xref>). We reasoned that the difference should reside in these structural features given the inherently mechanistic nature of cotranslational assembly.</p><p id="P25">We first investigated the propensity of homomeric and repeated subunits to form alpha helices. Surprisingly, we found that LOF subunits have fewer alpha helical secondary structure elements than DN subunits (26.7% vs 33.9%, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, Dunn’s test of multiple comparisons with Holm-Bonferroni correction, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3C</xref>) or AR subunits (33.3%, p = 2.8 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Although helix propensity correlates with cotranslational assembly, it is possible that there are stronger functional constraints that determine whether or not a complex forms on the ribosome. We thought that the low helix content in the LOF group may be indicative of high protein disorder, as disorder is naturally anticorrelated with structured regions in proteins. To investigate this, we took advantage of the structure-averaged pLDDT (predicted local-distance difference test) values from the AlphaFold predicted human protein models, which are highly predictive of intrinsic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akdel et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Tunyasuvunakool et al. 2021</xref>). As expected, LOF homomers and heteromers exhibit the lowest median pLDDT value (median = 75.7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3D</xref>), significantly lower than DN subunits (median = 77, p = 1.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, Dunn’s test of multiple comparisons with Holm-Bonferroni correction) and AR subunits (median = 83.3, p = 1.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Therefore, the structures of LOF subunits are likely to contain a high fraction of disorder. This conclusion is consistent with our earlier result showing that LOF subunits are almost seven-fold more likely to be transcription factors than other disease genes, because transcription factors are known to be strongly associated with intrinsic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Liu et al. 2006</xref>). Transcription factor subunits may benefit from cotranslational assembly as a means of preventing their toxicity and fine-tuning the dosage and timing of their expression during developmental processes and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Schwarz and Beck 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We next assessed the influence of subunit interface area in homomeric subunits, which we have shown to have a strong relationship with cotranslational assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>). Homomeric complexes with larger subunit:subunit contact areas are more hydrophobic and therefore experience a stronger drive to assemble as soon as their interfaces become exposed on the ribosome. Due to the unique structural and functional characteristics associated with homomeric symmetry, we split the subunit interface areas based upon their symmetry group. The analysis revealed that subunits associated with DN disease mutations do not have smaller interfaces than most other disease associated subunits that would make them less likely to cotranslationally assemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3E</xref>). In fact, interface areas of LOF homomers are significantly smaller than those of the DN subunits in the main symmetry groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3E</xref>). On one hand, this result is consistent with the enrichment of pathogenic mutations at interfaces of DN subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2C</xref>), which, assuming a random mutation model, would be less likely to occur if the interfaces were small. On the other hand, GOF, DN, as well as AD/AR subunits may have larger interface areas simply because it reflects the biological significance of their interfaces, since their molecular mechanisms are dependent upon complex assembly. Conversely, subunits in the LOF group may have a higher fraction of crystallographic interfaces, which tend to be smaller (Prasad Bahadur et al. 2004).</p><p id="P27">The third structural property we investigated is the relative interface location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>). N-terminal regions of proteins are more likely to be involved in cotranslational interactions because of vectorial synthesis on the ribosome, an intuitive assumption supported by experimental observations (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Kamenova et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Natan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Shiber et al. 2018</xref>). We hypothesised that interfaces of homomeric subunits with DN disease mutations should be C-terminally shifted, which would strongly decrease their tendency to cotranslationally assemble. We first calculated the relative interface location for all homomeric subunits and the average interface location of the symmetry groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3F</xref>). Based upon the difference between the symmetry average and the subunits’ relative interface location, we found that the interfaces of twofold symmetric dimers with DN disease mutations are significantly more C-terminal than what is expected from the symmetry group (p = 0.025; Holm-Bonferroni corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test against basemean). To quantify this difference, we resampled the dataset of twofold homodimers with replacement stratified by molecular mechanisms and calculated confidence intervals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref> show the raw relative interface location values as well as the bootstrap distribution of the relative interface shift, i.e. distance from the symmetry mean. The relative interface shift can be interpreted as a percentage, where +5% indicates that the subunit’s observed interface is C-terminal to its expected value by 5% of the protein’s length. According to this, subunits of homodimers with DN disease mutations are 6% more C-terminal than the symmetry group mean (p = 7 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, resampling p-value).</p><p id="P28">We illustrate the mechanistic interpretation of this finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>. The retinoid isomerohydrolase (RPE65) is an enzyme involved in the conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters into 11-cis-retinol, which is essential for phototransduction in the retinal pigment epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Kiser et al. 2015</xref>). Both autosomal recessive and dominant mutations in <italic>RPE65</italic> have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, which makes heterozygous mutations in the gene less likely to act via simple LOF mechanisms. The DN mutation D477G was found to exert a DN effect on the wild-type and lead to delayed chromophore regeneration (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Bowne et al. 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the interface of RPE65 during translation is exposed 22.6% later than what would be expected from an average <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> dimer, which is a condition that does not favour assembly on the ribosome. Consistently, RPE65 was not detected to cotranslationally assemble by disome selective ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>). These observations support a model whereby subunits that expose their interface residues late in the translation process are less likely to cotranslationally assemble and as a result, are more likely to be associated with DN mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Training and assessing a classifier for the prioritisation of genes with alternative molecular mechanisms</title><p id="P29">There have been important studies aimed at understanding the properties of haploinsufficient genes and their prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dang et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Huang et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Karczewski et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">MacArthur et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Petrovski et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Shihab et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Steinberg et al. 2015</xref>), but comparatively little effort has been channelled into exploring the characteristics of genes that give rise to dominant disorders in a manner not explained by simple LOF.

This observation emphasises the importance of considering alternative molecular mechanisms in our collective attempt to annotate the human pathogenic variation. While the text-mining strategy we utilised here was able to provide likely molecular mechanism assignments for 1,185 dominant disease genes, many others remain unknown. Moreover, for as-of-yet undiscovered disease genes, there is a strong possibility that we could miss pathogenic mutations due to their association with DN or GOF mechanisms and thus worsen computational predictions. To facilitate future variant-level molecular mechanism prediction and aid clinical geneticists evaluate the potential of novel inherited or <italic>de novo</italic> mutations to inflict a non-LOF consequence on the protein, we built a classifier with the goal of identifying genes most likely to be associated with non-LOF genes over those that are primarily associated with LOF mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">We first reviewed the literature to identify properties of LOF genes and then trained a logistic regression model with lasso penalty using a range of diverse features, including cotranslational assembly (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al. 2021</xref>), the functional and structural determinants investigated in this study, as well as population-level mutational constraints (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Karczewski et al. 2020</xref>), evolutionary-, sequence-and interaction network-based properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Huang et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Shihab et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Steinberg et al. 2015</xref>), and experimental data (<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">Uhlen et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">M.

Measured on the test set, the classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), an F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.8, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chicco, Tötsch, and Jurman 2021</xref>) (detailed performance profile in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4</xref>). Cotranslational assembly was found to be a discriminating feature in the model, ranking 12<sup>th</sup> out of 30 features and being roughly one-fourth as important as the top predictor, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in the coding sequence of human relative to macaque genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Huang et al. 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, the second and third most important predictors in the model are transporter/channel function and the number of paralogues of the gene. It has been observed before that haplosufficient genes have higher average sequence identity to the closest paralogue than LOF genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Huang et al. 2010</xref>), suggesting functional compensation by closely related proteins. It is possible that due to this functional redundancy, autosomal dominant genes with a high number of paralogues are simply more likely to be associated with non-LOF mechanisms. For example, ion channel genes are known to have undergone multiple gene duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Liebeskind, Hillis, and Zakon 2015</xref>), which is consistent with their enrichment among DN and GOF subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2D/E</xref>). In cyclic complexes with more than one unique subunit, paralogous copies typically sequester in the same complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mallik, Tawfik, and Levy 2022</xref>), suggesting that information on paralogues is a valuable proxy for non-LOF mechanisms in homomers as well as in heteromers.</p><p id="P31">We derived two probability thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4E</xref>).

A possible consequence of this mechanism is that cotranslationally assembling subunits harbouring pathogenic heterozygous mutations may be sequestered into half of the protein complex pool rather than mixing with the wild-type and inflicting functionally harmful effects. By comparing the fraction of cotranslationally assembling subunits associated with Mendelian diseases, we showed that genes of homomers and repeated subunits inherited in an AD pattern are significantly depleted in this mode of assembly compared to AR genes. Moreover, we found that among AD genes of homomers those that exert a DN effect are the least likely to cotranslationally assemble compared to other protein-level molecular mechanisms of disease, but importantly, to those that predominantly harbour heterozygous LOF mutations.

It is possible that the high abundance and the structural properties of metabolic enzymes, such as their enrichment in the dihedral symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergendahl and Marsh 2017</xref>), necessarily lead to frequent cotranslational assembly events, representing an additional safety factor against the deleteriousness of dominant, especially DN mutations.

The interface was defined as the difference between the solvent accessible surface area of the subunit in isolation and within the context of the full complex. Subunits with interfaces &gt;400 Å<sup>2</sup> were considered for analysis to exclude potentially crystallographic interfaces.</p><p id="P40">We extended the PDB dataset with homology models of human homomeric complexes in the SWISS-MODEL repository (UniProt release 2022_02) (Bienert et al., 2017; Waterhouse et al., 2018). Models based on isoform sequences were excluded. The software AnAnaS (Pagès et al., 2018; Pagès &amp;Grudinin, 2018) was run on default settings to determine the number of subunits and the symmetry group of the complexes. In rare cases when symmetry was not detected, we assigned the symmetry group of the PDB template used to model the complex. If a protein was found in multiple homology models, we selected the one with the largest number of subunits followed by the length of the modelled chain. The interface area was calculated at residue-level between all pairs of subunits with FreeSASA 2.0.3 (Mitternacht, 2016), using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. We performed pairwise alignments between the modelled chain and the paired UniProt sequence to confirm residue correspondence to the canonical sequence, because any mismatch in residue numbering could influence the relative interface location metric. Similarly to the PDB structure data, only subunits with interfaces &gt;400 Å<sup>2</sup> were included in the analyses. When the SWISS-MODEL dataset was pooled with the PDB dataset, we prioritised the homomeric subunit with the larger interface area.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Relative interface location</title><p id="P41">The relative interface location is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the location of the interface relative to the protein termini (N=0 and C=1), and it was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badonyi and Marsh 2022</xref>). To ensure the analysis is not biased by homologous proteins, we generated a distance matrix based on the sequences of the chains from the structures using Clustal Omega version 1.2.4 (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Sievers et al. 2011</xref>).

Briefly, for each residue with pLDDT &gt; 50, we calculated the alpha carbon distance to all other residues with a known ClinVar disease mutation, selecting the shortest distance. The final metric is derived as the ratio of the common logarithm of non-disease and disease average distances.

For homomers, we used UniProt (Bateman et al., 2021), EMBL-EBI ComplexPortal (Meldal et al., 2019), CORUM (Giurgiu et al., 2019), the OmniPath database (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Dénes et al. 2021</xref>), as well as single spanning membrane homodimers from the Membranome 3.0 database (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Lomize et al. 2022</xref>).

We searched PubMed using the keywords “dominant negative” for the dominant-negative (DN) mechanism, “gain of function” OR “activating mutation” for the gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism, and “haploinsufficiency” OR “haploinsufficient” OR “dosage sensitivity” OR “dosage sensitive” OR “heterozygous loss of function” for the loss-of-function (LOF) mechanism. The same workflow was applied to OMIM entries. The resulting corpus was tokenised into sentences and, to facilitate downstream data curation, we filtered for lines that explicitly mention the keywords, thus keeping the most descriptive lines for each gene. The LOF class was appended with genes annotated in the ClinGen database (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Rehm et al. 2015</xref>) as “Sufficient evidence for dosage pathogenicity” (as of 2022-07-07), and a supporting evidence was added from the ClinGen entry. The raw evidence lines were manually reviewed and obvious false positives were removed. For example, in the LOF class a line may be: “… individuals harboring a heterozygous deletion in ATAD3A are unaffected suggesting a dominant-negative pathogenic mechanism or a gain-of-function mechanism for de novo missense variants rather than haploinsufficiency” (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Harel et al. 2016</xref>), which explicitly dismisses haploinsufficiency as a molecular mechanism. Importantly, we noticed that a substantial fraction of GOF and DN evidence lines relate to artificial constructs used in biological research and had no association to human disease, which further necessitated manual curation. In overlap cases, when genes belong to multiple categories, we employed a hierarchical strategy to create a non-redundant gene list: DN &gt; GOF &gt; LOF.

However, no performance gain was observed relative to a simpler and more interpretable regression model (data not shown). Logistic regression with lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a solution to fitting a model in which only certain variables play a role. The algorithm applies increasingly larger penalties to multivariable regression coefficients, shrinking those of less important variables to zero, causing their sequential drop-out (L1 regularisation) and thus retaining only informative features. First, to avoid inflating the model’s performance by presence of homologues, we performed redundancy filtering at 50% sequence identity on the full canonical protein sequences using the method described in the section <bold>Relative interface location</bold>. This procedure removed 88 from the 879 genes with experimentally available structure data and dominant molecular mechanism classifications. The remaining 791 genes, of which 543 (69%) are non-LOF and 248 (31%) are LOF, were split into 75% training and 25% test sets with 10-fold cross-validation performed on the training set and repeated 3 times. The model was tuned using 18 values of the λ parameter, generated to be log-linearly distributed between 0 and 1. The final value of λ = 0.00501 was chosen on the basis that it yielded the highest prediction accuracy in the assessment-folds of the cross-validation. The model was finalised on the entire training set and evaluated on the test set. The similarity of ROC AUCs measured on the cross-validation folds (0.735) versus on the test set (0.743) suggested that the model had not been overfitted. Variable importance was computed as the absolute values of the β coefficients scaled to the [0,1] interval. Model building and evaluation was performed using the <monospace>tidymodels R</monospace> metapackage. Thresholds T1 and T2 were derived using the <monospace>threshold_perf()</monospace> function from the R package <monospace>probably</monospace>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157267-supplement-Table_S1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d89aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS157267-supplement-Table_S2.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d89aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS157267-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MB is supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council EASTBIO Doctoral Training Programme (BB/M010996/1), and used resources provided by the Edinburgh Compute and Data Facility.

This means that homogenous wild-type and mutant complexes form only 25% of the time.
