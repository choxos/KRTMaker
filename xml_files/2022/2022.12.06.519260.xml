However, the overlap between well-being and depressive symptoms is only moderate. Phenotypic correlations range between -.40 and -.60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and genetic correlations from -.50 to -.81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Well-being and ill-being are thus seen as distinct, but related domains of mental health.</p><p id="P6">A distinction is often made between hedonic well-being and eudaimonic well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Hedonistic philosophical ideas on well-being include maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Modern-day hedonic well-being measures focus on levels of positive and negative affect, and satisfaction with life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Eudaimonic philosophical theories extend beyond pleasure and pain, and emphasizes living a virtuous life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Current eudaimonic well-being measures include measures of positive functioning, thriving, and judgments about the meaning and purpose of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In this project we operationalized hedonic well-being with a measure of happiness and eudaimonic well-being with a measure of meaning in life.</p><p id="P7">Hedonic and eudaimonic measures of well-being have been found to load on separate, but correlated factors (&gt;.60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In recent molecular genetic work, the moderate phenotypic correlation between happiness (hedonic well-being) and meaning in life (eudaimonic well-being) was replicated (r<sub>ph</sub> = 0.53) and a strong genetic correlation (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.78) was observed, suggesting a largely shared genetic etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Furthermore, genetic correlations with related traits were similar for happiness and meaning in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The only genetic correlation that differed for happiness compared to meaning in life was with depressive symptoms, with a moderate genetic correlation for happiness (r<sub>g</sub> = -0.53, <italic>SE</italic>=.04), and a smaller correlation for meaning in life (r<sub>g</sub> = -0.32, <italic>SE</italic>=.05).</p><p id="P8">The reported phenotypic and genetic correlations between happiness, meaning in life and depressive symptoms indicate substantial overlap between well-being and depressive symptoms. However, less is known about the part that makes well-being unique, i.e., independent from depressive symptoms. Recently, GWAS-by-subtraction was developed in order to disentangle the shared and unique genetic variance for traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). To further investigate the (genetic) overlap and differences between happiness and meaning in life, and the overlap with depressive symptoms, we applied GWAS-by-subtraction on UK Biobank data. Subtracting a depressive symptoms GWAS from happiness and meaning GWASs in UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), we obtained GWASs of respectively ‘pure’ happiness and ‘pure’ meaning. In follow-up analyses, we investigated the genetic variants associated with pure happiness and pure meaning using functional annotation and genetic correlations with other traits.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods | material"><title>Methods and Material</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P9">UK Biobank is a large, population-based prospective study with data from over half a million participants of middle to old age from the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). During the initial assessment visit (2006-2010) a touchscreen questionnaire was used to collect extensive information, including sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle exposures and general health from the participants. In a later follow-up (2016), participants completed online questionnaires, including mental health and well-being questions.</p><p id="P10">We used data from 427,580 participants with genetic data and data on depressive symptoms from the initial assessment. Permission to access both phenotypic and genetic UK Biobank data was obtained under application number 40310.

To briefly summarize, participants were assayed using two similar genotyping arrays, the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE and UK Biobank Axiom Arrays. The phasing and imputing were performed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium and merged UK10K and 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panels. The quality control was designed to address issues specific to a large-scale dataset. Quality control steps for markers included testing for batch effects, plate effects, departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, sex effects, array effects, and discordance across control replicates. Samples were excluded based on non-European ancestry, sex mismatch between genetic result and self-report, and metrics of missing rate and heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P13">The analyses were pre-registered before data analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/pnc2z">https://osf.io/pnc2z</ext-link>).</p><sec id="S11"><title>GWAS depressive symptoms</title><p id="P14">The genome-wide association analysis on the created depressive symptoms score was performed in GCTA using linear mixed modelling (LMM).

For each SNP, GWAS-by-subtraction estimates the association with a trait of interest that is independent of the association of that SNP with another trait, in our case well-being and depressive symptoms. In the model, the GWAS summary statistics of both traits are regressed on two latent variables, i.e., <italic>Depressive Symptoms</italic> and <italic>Pure Happiness</italic> or <italic>Pure Meaning</italic> (see lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These latent factors are regressed on each SNP (see top part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For each SNP, this model results in two paths of association. In one path, the SNP effects are mediated by depressive symptoms. The other path is independent from depressive symptoms and indicates the SNP effects for pure well-being. In other words, the variance of well-being is separated in a part shared between well-being and depressive symptoms, and in a part unique for well-being, i.e., pure well-being. The genetic variance for pure happiness and pure meaning is by design independent of the genetic variance for depressive symptoms (r<sub>g</sub> = 0).

Different patterns of genetic correlations emerged, including (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) non-changing genetic correlations, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) changed correlations from significant to zero, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) reversed genetic correlations. We discuss the meaning and implications of these different patterns of genetic correlations below.</p><p id="P40">First, genetic correlations between pure well-being and respectively family, friend, and job satisfaction did not change compared to the genetic correlations with well-being. The genetic predisposition to be satisfied with different life aspects is therefore related to the unique part of well-being and unrelated to the genetic predisposition for depressive symptoms. An exception is health satisfaction, being strongly related to depressive symptoms, the genetic correlation with pure well-being became non-significant, in line with the traits discussed next.</p><p id="P41">Second, as one could expect, pure well-being became genetically unrelated to traits correlating strongly with depressive symptoms, i.e., tiredness, overall health, and psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. This pattern indicates that part of the genetic variance of well-being can be seen on the continuum from depressive symptoms to well-being. The associations of well-being with these depression-related traits arise from the overlap with depressive symptoms and should be interpreted considering the current findings.</p><p id="P42">Third, for several other traits, including ADHD, SES, and substance use, the genetic correlations with well-being changed substantially after the subtraction of depressive symptoms. This indicates unique genetic overlap between pure well-being and these traits, independently from depressive symptoms. We shortly discuss possible explanations and mechanisms underlying the changed genetic correlations for these traits.</p><sec id="S28"><title>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</title><p id="P43">ADHD is a neurodevelopment disorder including symptoms of impaired attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). ADHD is related to poor outcomes in academic achievement, and work performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). A positive genetic correlation between ADHD and depressive symptoms has been reported (e.g., see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)). Our results indicate that a higher genetic predisposition for ADHD is also related to a higher genetic predisposition for pure well-being. An explanation for this finding could be the benefits and positive effects of ADHD symptoms in well-functioning individuals. Positive traits associated with ADHD include hyper focus, creativity, spontaneity, resilience, and high energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These benefits are also related to well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), suggesting the genetic correlation between pure well-being and ADHD captures the benefits of ADHD, when taking out the genetic predisposition for depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Income, educational attainment (EA) and intelligence</title><p id="P44">Income, EA, and intelligence are strongly interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We found similar effects of subtracting a depressive symptoms GWAS from well-being on the genetic correlations with these traits. The pure well-being genetic correlations indicated that people with a higher genetic predisposition for pure well-being also have a genetic predisposition for lower income, EA, and intelligence. Furthermore, the genetic correlations became similar in magnitude to the negative correlations of these traits with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Different mechanisms underlying the negative genetic correlation between depressive symptoms and income/EA/intelligence have been proposed. Low income/EA/intelligence can increase the risk of depression or vice versa, depressive symptoms have detrimental effects on the ability to actively and optimally participate in school and the labor force, leading to lower EA and incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The slightly positive genetic correlation between well-being and the traits before subtraction seems to be driven by the shared part with depressive symptoms, i.e., the opposite effects of depressive symptoms.</p><p id="P45">Possible explanations for the reversed genetic correlations for pure well-being can be non-linear relations between well-being and income, EA, or intelligence. For example, for both income and intelligence, satiation and turning points on well-being have been found. The satiation point of income suggests that above a certain level of income that is sufficient to fulfil basic physical needs, higher income does not lead to higher levels of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The turning point of income indicates that people with very high incomes report lower well-being levels compared to those with lower incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). However, results tend to depend on analytic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Similar, in highly intellectually “gifted” individuals (i.e., very high intellect, IQ ≥ 130), lower levels of well-being have been found compared to high-achieving individuals (i.e., only a high performance) and the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Intellectually gifted individuals can be at a greater risk for the development of a meaning in life crisis. To further explore the negative genetic associations between pure well-being and income/intelligence, we performed exploratory analyses on phenotypic associations between income/intelligence and happiness/meaning in life in a high and low income/intelligence group (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Material</xref>). The results were inconclusive. Therefore, and because the UK Biobank sample has a higher socioeconomic status compared to the general population, more research on the association between income/EA/intelligence, well-being, and depressive symptoms in a multivariate design is needed to test these relations.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Substance use and food-related traits</title><p id="P46">A consistent pattern of genetic correlations between pure well-being and substance use and food-related traits appeared as well, although not all correlations reached significance after correcting for multiple testing. Smoking, alcohol intake frequency, BMI, and body fat were genetically positively related to depressive symptoms and unrelated or slightly negatively associated to well-being. Pure well-being became positively genetically related to these traits after subtracting depressive symptoms. A possible explanation for these reversed genetic correlations for pure well-being could be the different underlying reasons why people smoke, drink, and eat. The genetic overlap between depressive symptoms and these traits can arise from self-medication, i.e., smoking, drinking and eating to cope and reduce the negative mood or other depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In contrast, smoking, drinking, and eating that is genetically related to pure well-being could arise from these behaviors in social settings. More research is needed to investigate the specific associations of well-being and substance use and eating variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Limitations and implications</title><p id="P47">The results should be interpreted in light of some limitations. The UK Biobank sample is known to be biased, participants are on average older, healthier, include more females, and have a higher socioeconomic status compared to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Therefore, subtraction in UK Biobank GWASs might have introduced extra bias in the pure well-being GWASs, possibly influencing the results and genetic correlations of pure well-being with other traits. Furthermore, UK Biobank focuses on samples from European ancestry. Well-being is differently conceptualized in different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), limiting generalization across samples with other ancestries. Replication of these results using GWASs from population-wide samples and more ancestry-diverse samples is needed.</p><p id="P48">If replicated, the findings can have important implications for mental health research and preventions or interventions. Note that we reported genetic correlations, indicating genetic sensitivity to both traits and we did not investigate direct phenotypic associations or causal effects. The patterns of genetic correlations of well-being versus pure well-being indicate that the genetic variance of well-being can be split into two parts having different associations with other traits. Part of the variance of well-being is overlapping with depressive symptoms, whereas the other part is unique to well-being. Based on our results, different associations could therefore be taken into account depending on the goal of the intervention. If the goal is to both decrease depressive symptoms and increase well-being, interventions should consider variables that are (causally) related to both depressive symptoms and well-being. If the goal is to increase well-being, instead of just reducing depressive symptoms, interventions should focus on variables that are (causally) related to pure well-being. Our results can be used as a starting point to find these variables and design future interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Sensitivity Analyses + Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS158245-supplement-Supplemental_Sensitivity_Analyses___Figures.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS158245-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all participants, who provided data for this study.</p><sec id="S33"><title>Funding</title><p>This work is supported by an ERC consolidation grant (WELL-BEING 771057 PI Bartels) and by the grant 531003014 from The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMW).</p></sec></ack><sec id="S34" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P49">The data that support the findings are available via the UK Biobank.
