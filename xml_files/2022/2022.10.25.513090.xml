However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants raises concerns of reduced vaccine effectiveness and increased risk of infection. Repeated homologous booster in elderly individuals and immunocompromised patients is considered to solve severe form of disease caused by new SARS-CoV-2 variants but cannot protect completely against breakthrough infection. In our previous study we assessed the immunogenicity of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV-2-S1 (Ad5.S1) in mice, resulting in that a single immunization with Ad5.S1, via subcutaneously injection or intranasal delivery, induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. As a follow up study, here we showed that vaccinated mice had high titers of anti-S1 antibodies at one year after vaccination compared to PBS immunized mice. Furthermore, one booster dose of non-adjuvanted recombinant S1Beta (rS1Beta) subunit vaccine was effective in stimulating strong long-lived S1-specific immune responses and inducing significantly high neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan, Beta, and Delta strain with 3.6- to 19.5-fold change increases. Importantly, the booster dose elicits cross-reactive antibody responses resulting in ACE2 binding inhibition against spike of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta, Kappa, New York, India) as early as two-week post-boost injection, persisting over 28 weeks after a booster vaccination. Interestingly, levels of neutralizing antibodies were correlated with not only level of S1-binding IgG but also level of ACE2 inhibition in the before- and after-booster serum samples. Our findings show that S1 recombinant protein subunit vaccine candidate as a booster has potential to offer cross-neutralization against broad variants, and has important implications for vaccine control of new emerging breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 variants in elderly individuals primed with adenovirus-based vaccine like AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>S1 recombinant protein</kwd><kwd>adenovirus-vectored vaccine</kwd><kwd>subunit vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of COVID-19 in December 2019 and resulted in a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has 622 million confirmed cases, 6.5 million reported deaths, and 12.7 billion vaccine doses administered worldwide (until October 12, 2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Six vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the spike (S) protein (BNT162b2; AZD1222; Ad26.COV2.S; mRNA-1273; NVX-CoV2373; Ad5-nCoV) have been approved by World Health Organization (WHO) and have greatly reduced the rate of severe disease and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. However, SARS-CoV-2 evolution gave rise to multiple variants including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and lastly Omicron (B.1.1.529), characterized by potential increased transmissibility, neutralizing antibody escape, and reduced effectiveness of vaccinations or antibody treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">It is clear that age alone is the most significant risk factor for death due to COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].

Furthermore, elderly individuals induced poor neutralization, which could be explained by lower serum IgG level and lower somatic hypermutation in B cell selection, along with lower IL-2-producing CD4<sup>+</sup>Tcells help compared to younger individuals, and all of which are overcame by booster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. These data are in line with previous findings that immune responses in aged mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 was lower than those in younger mice, which was overcome by booster dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the upper and lower respiratory tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

VOCs have mutations or deletions in the spike protein, with some mutations occurring in the RBD, resulting in the highest resistance to vaccine-induced and infection-acquired immunity. In response to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and the global circulation of VOC, the booster injection has been considered to protect from breakthrough infections of new emerging variants.

To assess long-term persistence of immunogenicity, we first determined antigen-specific IgG antibody endpoint titers in the sera of vaccinated mice (Ad5.S1 immunized groups either via I.N. delivery or S.C. injection) and control mice (PBS or Adψ5 immunized groups) at week 52, one year after vaccination. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, significantly high titers of anti-S1 IgG antibodies were present in Ad5.S1 vaccinated mouse groups (G4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016 and G5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0365) even after one year of vaccination as compared to AdΨ5-vaccinated mouse groups (G2 and G3) or PBS group (G1). To assess the booster effect of subunit vaccine, we collected serum samples from all mice before booster immunization (W52) and immunized animals with 15 μg of rS1Beta intramuscularly, collected sera subsequent weeks, and examined the end point titer of IgG against the S1 subunit of the spike protein (anti-S1) binding antibodies by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

The change of geometric mean titers (GMT) of IgG end point titer in G4 and G5 compared to those at week 52 were same as 32-fold at week 54, and 55.7-fold and 18.4-fold at week 56, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1A</xref>). Interestingly, the peak of IgG end point titer showed at week 56 (at week 4 after a booster) in G4, while it showed at week 54 (at week 2 after a booster) in G5. These recalls were faster after a booster vaccination with rS1Beta subunit vaccine when compared with IgG end point titer after prime (week 6 post-prime vs. week 2 or 4 post-boost) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the elicited IgG antibody responses after a booster lasted longer, through week 80 (maximum length of the study to date), than after a prime, resulting from the comparison with IgG end point titers at week 28 post-prime (W28) or post-boost (W80) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1B</xref>). The mouse group primed subcutaneously (G4) had higher antibody titers as compared to mouse group primed intranasally (G5).

Interestingly, IgG2a (Th1) responses were recalled faster than IgG1 (Th2) in both G4 and G5 (peak at week 54 vs. week 56, respectively).

However, it may not guarantee that SC injection will be better than IN delivery for protection against existing and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Various studies reported that vaccine delivered intranasally elicited superior mucosal immunity compared to the intramuscular injection, and protected efficiently after the challenge and reduced viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study of adjuvanted S1 subunit vaccines primed-boosted intramuscularly or primed intramuscularly-boosted intranasally in rhesus macaques reported that the mucosal vaccine demonstrated outstanding protection in both upper and lower respiratory tracts by clearing of the input virus more efficiently through higher dimeric IgA and IFN-α in BAL fluid, although intranasal boosting elicited weaker T cell and lower neutralizing antibody titer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><p id="P17">In this study, high titer of serum S1-binding IgG was investigated up to 28 weeks after a booster in aged mice primed Ad5.S1 one year ago (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement Fig1B</xref>). Although limits of IgG duration of mice may not be reflective of that measured in non-human primates or humans, this result implied that humoral immunity might be long-lasting after a booster, because IgG titers at 28 weeks post-booter in G4 and G5 was approximately 6-fold and 1.7-fold higher than those at 28 weeks post-prime, respectively. Indeed, boosting enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses dramatically in aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Likewise, one of the approved COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, which is single-shot regimen vaccine protecting against severe COVID-19, induced durable immune responses detected up to 8 months after vaccination in human, although it remains unclear how long immune protection will last after previous infection or vaccination due to the limited length of follow-up studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The protection of two doses of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine waned considerably after 6 months in human. However, infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high for more than 1 year after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p><p id="P18">Subunit vaccine booster elicited both of high S1-specific IgG1 and IgG2a subclass antibodies in aged mice primed with Ad5.S1, indicating a balanced Th1/Th2 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>), whereas subunit vaccine alone induced high IgG1 with lower IgG2a leading a possibility of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VARED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Indeed, VARED-like pulmonary immunopathology related with Th2-based immune responses was observed in animals with whole-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. In this study, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and the balanced Th1/Th2 immune response were induced, suggesting that a booster of subunit vaccine after an adenoviral prime vaccine might avoid Th2-based immune response and the occurrence of VAERD.</p><p id="P19">Neutralization assay was frequently used as a correlate of protection following vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Here we used a microneutralization test to evaluate the function of the generated antibodies in the sera of immunized mice. The titer of neutralizing antibodies dramatically increased after a booster and neutralized other variants of Beta and Gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). Our future studies will include the evaluation of neutralization effect against omicron variant. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that the boosted immune response by mRNA BNT162b2 neutralized omicron variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. If needed, it may be possible to further improve neutralizing antibody responses with a booster of omicron BA.5 rS1 subunit vaccine to overcome the emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are effective at blocking spike-ACE2 binding to prevent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. As a conventional pseudo-neutralizing test, measurement of competitive immunoassay for quantifying inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for traditional virus-based plaque reduction neutralizing assay and reported in a high level of concordance and correlation (&gt;96%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In this study, we assessed animal immune response for blocking spike-ACE2 binding using V-PLEX neutralization panel kit and showed that a booster of aged mice primed with Ad5.S1 could induce significant blocking in binding of ACE2 to spike of all tested variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), which was correlated with VNT<sub>90</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). In addition, our future work will include more investigation in blocking of binding of ACE2 to spike of omicron variants.</p><p id="P20">Here we showed non-adjuvated subunit vaccine booster effect. However, there will be a beneficial effect of an adjuvanted subunit booster strategy for protection, especially against distant variants such as Omicron BA.5. Actually, AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) induced higher neutralizing antibody titers against Beta variant in non-human primates compared to animal group boosted with non-adjuvanted vaccine in the mRNA-primed cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. AS01-like adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine enhanced Th1 type-IgG2a isotype, neutralizing antibodies, and IFN-γ secreting T cell immune responses in both young and aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Recombinant S protein in combination with adjuvant CoVaccine HT™ induced a balanced IgG subtype antibody response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p id="P21">Two limitations of this study were T-cell immunity and SARS-CoV-2 challenge, which were not performed to test the cellular immunity and to assess the protection efficiency of booster vaccination. However, various studies have reported previously that T-cell immunity was activated after a booster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Homologous and heterologous boosters in health care workers who had received a priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S Covid-19 vaccine resulted in higher levels of T-cell responses than non-booster group, although T-cell response was significantly larger with mRNA-based vaccines (91%) than with the homologous booster (72%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Additionally, a booster dose of mRNA BNT162b2 elicits robust T cell responses that cross-recognized SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Not only mRNA vaccine but also adenoviral vector or adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines enhanced cellular immune response in aged mice after a boost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, S-specific T-cell responses were positively correlated with the presence of S-specific binding antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], implying induction of robust T cell immune response after rS1beta booster in this study.</p><p id="P22">As our study does not define protection ability against SARS-CoV-2 variants by challenge, it needs to be investigated in the future. Notably, a recent study was performed a protection experiment against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in aged BALB/c mice boosted with mRNA vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. This natural mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection by assessing viral replication and histopathological changes in the lung, does not require genetic modification of mice or viruses. However, this wild mouse animal model only supports infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry the N501Y mutation, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Therefore, it is still important that K18-hACE2 and other hACE2-transgenic mice are also used to investigate pathogenicity of different SARS-CoV-2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p><p id="P23">Overall, our study evaluated the effect of a booster in aged mice after priming of adenoviral vaccines as a pre-clinical model of elderly peoples immunized with the current approved Covid-19 vaccines. Our findings may have implications for further study of using recombinant protein S1BA.5 subunit vaccine as a booster to enhance cross-neutralizing antibodies against new emerging variants of concern.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Construction of recombinant protein expressing vectors</title><p id="P24">The coding sequence for SARS-CoV-2-S1 amino acids 1 to 661 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] mutated at del144; K417N; E484K; N501Y; A570D; D614G having C-terminal tag known as ‘C-tag’, composed of the four amino acids (aa), glutamic acid–proline–glutamic acid–alanine (E-P-E-A) flanked with Sal I &amp; Not I was codon-optimized using the UpGene algorithm for optimal expression in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and synthesized (GenScript).
