Here we present an automatic procedure requiring only sequence information and crystallographic data that uses AlphaFold predictions to produce an electron density map and a structural model. Iterating through cycles of structure prediction is a key element of our procedure: a predicted model rebuilt in one cycle is used as a template for prediction in the next cycle. We applied this procedure to X-ray data for 215 structures released by the Protein Data Bank in a recent 6-month period. In 87% of cases our procedure yielded a model with at least 50% of C<sub>α</sub> atoms matching those in the deposited models within 2Å. Predictions from our iterative template-guided prediction procedure were more accurate than those obtained without templates. We suggest a general strategy for macromolecular structure determination that includes AI-based prediction both as a starting point and as a method of model optimization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The development of AI-based methods for prediction of protein structures has been widely recognized as a turning point for structural biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

This procedure requires processed crystallographic data (structure factor amplitudes and their uncertainties, space group and unit cell dimensions for the crystal, and the resolution of the data) and information about the sequences of the macromolecules present in the crystal. It produces an optimized (density-modified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>) electron density map and a model based on that map.

If other components are present, such as RNA/DNA, only the protein part of the resulting map is interpreted.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Determination of challenging structures using AlphaFold prediction</title><p id="P6">The method of molecular replacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, in which an initial model that is similar to the structure to be determined is used as a hypothesis for the actual structure, has been applied in about 80% of recent macromolecular crystal structure determinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Once the orientation and location of the initial model is found, the model and density map are usually improved by cycles of map calculation alternating with map representation as an atomic model with restrained geometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These procedures work best if the initial models are within about 1 Å to 2 Å (rmsd of C<sub>α</sub> atoms) over about 50% of the structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Excitement about AlphaFold predictions in the crystallographic field comes from the observation that such predictions may generally be accurate enough to provide the necessary starting point for molecular replacement, largely removing the need for using anomalous scattering or other experiments to obtain crystallographic phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Here we use an automated procedure to test the iterative use of AlphaFold predictions in macromolecular crystallography. To recreate a situation where challenging new structures are being determined with AlphaFold predictions, we selected structures obtained with anomalous scattering, an approach typically used when molecular replacement is expected to fail, but we did not include the anomalous diffraction information. For Protein Data Bank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (PDB) entries released in the 6-month period starting from Dec. 8 2021 through June 29, 2022, this selection yielded 215 unique structures with resolutions ranging from 1.0 Å to 4.6 Å.</p><p id="P8">We applied our iterative procedure for AlphaFold prediction and model improvement to each of the 215 deposited datasets. In seven cases, the initial molecular replacement step did not yield any solution and the analysis was not continued. For the remaining 208 datasets our procedure generated density-modified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> electron density maps and models interpreting those maps. To identify which maps and models were at least partially correct, we compared the density-modified electron density maps with model-based (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>calc</italic></sub>) maps calculated from the corresponding deposited structures. Using a conservative minimum map correlation of at 0.5 as a threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, 187 of 215 analyses (87%) were successful and the remaining 28 (including the seven that failed in molecular replacement) were unsuccessful.</p><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the distribution of map-model correlation values. For the successful cases, the average map correlation was 0.84. The solid bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> illustrate the completeness of these structures, as measured by the percentage of C<sub>α</sub> atoms in deposited models matching those within 2 Å in the rebuilt models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The average completeness was 90%, and models for all but one were at least 50% complete. For the unsuccessful analyses (open bars), the completeness of the models was much lower (average of 20%). In a few of the successful instances the final structures contained domains that matched the deposited model, but the connectivity between domains was incorrect (e.g., PDB entry 7E1D which is a domain-swapped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> dimer). We included all matching parts by using space-group symmetry-related copies of each chain from the deposited models in the comparisons. The overall high success rate shows that in most cases, AlphaFold predictions are accurate and complete enough to be used as starting models in macromolecular crystallography.</p><p id="P10">AlphaFold provides residue-level confidence estimates including a predicted Local Difference Distance Test (pLDDT) associated with each amino acid residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Here we refer to residues with pLDDT values of 90 or higher as “high confidence”, and those with values of 70 or higher as moderate-to-high confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The success of automated structure determination using AlphaFold prediction was strongly dependent on the percentage of moderate-to-high confidence residues. For successful cases, an average of 90% of residues in the AlphaFold predictions were predicted with moderate-to-high confidence, and the smallest percentage of moderate-to-high confidence residues was 30%. For the 28 unsuccessful cases, the average percentage predicted with moderate-to-high confidence was much lower (50%).</p><p id="P11">We assessed the similarity of predicted models and corresponding deposited structures in more detail by superimposing the models, removing residues with low confidence (pLDDT &lt; 70), and further removing residues where the rmsd (smoothed with a window of 10 residues) was greater than 3 Å. We then noted the rmsd between matching C<sub>α</sub> atoms and the coverage, defined here as the percentage of residues in the deposited model that were matched by the predicted model. For successful cases, the average C<sub>α</sub> rmsd was 1.2 Å and the average coverage was 89%. Such values are normally associated with success in molecular replacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. For unsuccessful cases the average rmsd was 2.8 Å, much too high to expect success in molecular replacement, and the average coverage was 50%, a borderline value for success. Overall, 19 of the 28 failures had either a coverage less than 50%, an rmsd over 2 Å, or both.</p><p id="P12">When determining a new structure, metrics that do not depend on knowing the true structure are important for evaluating whether structure determination has been successful. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> shows two metrics that are available after structure determination and that are independent from knowledge of the true structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Log-likelihood gain (LLG) scores reflect the confidence of placing the model, and free R values reflect the cross-validated agreement of the model with crystallographic data after model rebuilding and refinement. The median LLG score for successful structure determinations with AlphaFold predictions was about 1000, while for unsuccessful cases the median was 80. We note that in a large-scale test of molecular replacement with homology models from the PDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, only 7% of cases had an LLG score over 1000 (median LLG score of 270). Our procedure using AlphaFold predictions therefore led to much higher LLG scores than typically obtained with homology models. The median free R value for successful cases was 0.30, a value normally associated with a largely-correct but unfinished structure (structures that do not contain waters, ligands, or any components other than protein). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> illustrates that most unsuccessful solutions had free R values above 0.5, log-likelihood gain scores below 100, or both, suggesting that the free R value and log-likelihood gain can be used effectively to evaluate potential solutions in new structure determinations using this procedure, as is standard practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> displays the free R values as a function of the high-resolution limit of the X-ray data and illustrates that the range of free R values depends slightly on the resolution of the data.</p><p id="P13">We evaluated whether our procedure may have yielded partially-correct solutions for some of the cases that we considered unsuccessful. For example, the model obtained by automated structure determination for PDB entry 7f05 had a map-model correlation of just 0.24 and was thus considered not successful. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref> shows that much of the rebuilt chain B for this structure (dark brown) very closely matches chain A in the deposited model (symmetry copy from the deposited model shown in light blue). However, the rest of the rebuilt model does not match the deposited structure. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref> shows that the density-modified map is also quite clear. This example shows that even an unsuccessful structure can contain some correct information. Furthermore, although our procedure did not complete the structure, other approaches such as repeating molecular replacement using this one chain as a starting point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> might well do so.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Iteration of AlphaFold prediction and model optimization</title><p id="P14">Our procedure for automatic structure determination iterates through AlphaFold prediction, using rebuilt chains obtained at the end of one cycle of iteration as templates for AlphaFold prediction in the next. In this procedure, map and model quality can improve at two stages. First, the new AlphaFold prediction using the previously rebuilt model as a template can yield an improved predicted model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and second, rebuilding can improve both model and map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Iteration is carried out until the change in the model from one cycle to the next is small. As models are not necessarily improved with rebuilding, they are evaluated based on their free R value, i.e. they are kept if the free R value decreases.</p><p id="P15"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows this procedure applied to PDB entry 7oa7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> which includes X-ray data to a resolution of 1.45 Å. This figure follows the models and their fit-to-map through two cycles of the procedure. The lefthand column shows ribbon overviews of superpositions onto the deposited 7oa7 deposited model (always in cyan). The two righthand columns are closeups superimposed on the map at the relevant stage: the central column (B, E, and H) shows the progression for a region that started out matching the deposited structure quite well, and the righthand column (C, F, and I) shows the progression for a region that started out matching quite poorly. For these two righthand columns, predicted models are in magenta and rebuilt models in dark blue, and time moves vertically downward. The top row shows the initial no-template prediction (magenta) and the map output from molecular replacement. The central row shows the rebuilt (dark blue) model and the map as rebuilt in cycle 1.

Some parts of the predicted model (magenta) match the deposited model (cyan) quite closely, such as the domain on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and the region near residues I166 and V193. Other parts, such as the region near residues Y21 and P141, have different backbone conformations. Still other parts, such as much of the domain on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, differ by a combination of local conformations and overall rotation and translation. Overall, the predicted model differs from the deposited model by a C<sub>α</sub> rmsd of 2.9 Å. The initial density map obtained after molecular replacement is quite clear in the region of residues I166 and V193 where the predicted model matches the deposited model closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In contrast, the map is less clear and does not match the predicted model in the region of residues Y21 and P141 where the deposited and predicted models differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">After automated crystallographic rebuilding starting with the predicted model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, the rebuilt model (dark blue) improves substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>); the overall C<sub>α</sub> rmsd to the deposited model is 0.1 Å, and 90% of C<sub>α</sub> atoms in the deposited model are within 2 Å of those in the rebuilt model. The density map is also considerably improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and 2F</xref>) and matches the rebuilt model quite closely in the region near I166 and V193 and, most notably, in the region near Y21 and P141 where the predicted and deposited models differed in the previous step.</p><p id="P18">Using the rebuilt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) as a template, a new AlphaFold prediction was obtained that is very similar to the deposited model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, overall C<sub>α</sub> rmsd of 0.5 Å) and that is quite different from the initial AlphaFold prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2H and 2I</xref> show that the template-based prediction matches the density-modified map, both in the region near I166 and V193 where the initial predicted model matched the deposited model and in the region near Y21 and P141 where it did not. The template-based prediction is even more complete than the template, with 99% of residues in the deposited model matched within 2 Å by a C<sub>α</sub> atom in the prediction. (The model used as a template had only 90% matched residues). Note that both the polypeptide backbone and the side chains in the template-based prediction closely match the density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>) and corresponding side-chain positions in the rebuilt model (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>)</p><p id="P19">Two additional cycles of rebuilding based on the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> resulted in a 95% complete model, i.e., where 95% of C<sub>α</sub> atoms in the deposited model matched those within 2 Å in the rebuilt model, with an overall C<sub>α</sub> rmsd of 0.1 Å.</p><p id="P20">In summary, though the initial AlphaFold prediction obtained for PDB entry 7oa7 was substantially different from the deposited model, a structure could be obtained on the first cycle of our procedure with standard molecular replacement and rebuilding procedures. Using the rebuilt model as a template for AlphaFold prediction, a new prediction was obtained that was far more accurate than the initial prediction. Three cycles of iteration for PDB entry 7oa7 led to a nearly-complete model matching the deposited structure closely, and required approximately 7 hours using 4 processors on a Linux server.</p><p id="P21">Although the template-based AlphaFold prediction for PDB entry 7oa7 is more complete than the rebuilt model, it is slightly less accurate (C<sub>α</sub> rmsd with deposited model of 0.5 Å vs 0.1 Å for Alphafold and rebuilt model, respectively). This is not surprising, as the AlphaFold prediction uses the experimental data only indirectly (in the form of the rebuilt model) and has not been adjusted to match the density map. In a real case, both the rebuilt model and final AlphaFold prediction would have utility in subsequent stages of structure determination, as the rebuilt model is slightly more accurate and the AlphaFold model is more complete.</p><p id="P22"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> shows histograms of free R values on the first and last cycles of our procedure for all 187 successful analyses. The free R value decreased with iteration in 88 of 187 cases, and on average, it was reduced from 0.33 to 0.31. Iteration was more successful when the free R value after the first cycle was poor. For the 109 cases where the free R value on the first cycle is worse than 0.30, 66 were improved by iteration, while for the 78 cases where the free R value was better or equal to 0.30, only 22 were improved. Presumably this is because the procedures used here do not generally yield free R values much better than 0.30.</p><p id="P23"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> shows the rmsd between C<sub>α</sub> atom coordinates in AlphaFold predictions for each structure and those in the corresponding chains of deposited models.

In the planning stages of an experiment, confidence measures for AlphaFold predictions can be used to assess whether predicted models obtained using sequence alone will be useful as starting points for structure determination. Also, the AlphaFold predictions can be used to design trimmed versions of a macromolecule that can be successfully crystallized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">To begin structure solution, AlphaFold predictions, trimmed to remove low-confidence regions, can be used as search models in molecular replacement, with a high probability of yielding a molecular replacement solution that is at least partially correct.</p><p id="P30">As in a conventional structure determination workflow, the next stage consists of refinement of the molecular replacement solution, followed by iterations of map calculation, density modification, and model rebuilding. This stage is typically carried out by existing automatic procedures that can improve both the model and the accuracy of the density maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. If there are major components of the structure that are not protein (i.e., RNA or DNA), these components would need to be built based on the density map, yielding a more complete model and an improved density map as well. In our procedure, such additional components are automatically used in subsequent cycles.</p><p id="P31">Once an improved model is obtained, AI-based prediction can be used again. This time, a working model is used as a template to guide AlphaFold prediction, as demonstrated here. This step can be thought of as a method of model optimization using AlphaFold. The working model guides AlphaFold prediction, yielding a prediction that has information from the working model but potentially with improved geometry or a more accurate overall conformation. This template-guided AlphaFold prediction can be carried out with or without information from multiple sequence alignments. The optimized models obtained in this way can be quite accurate, but as they are obtained without direct use of experimental information, they may not exactly match the density map at this point.</p><p id="P32">The new set of AlphaFold predictions can then be superimposed on corresponding parts of the working model, refined using experimental data, and then considered as new hypotheses about the structure. It is anticipated that after a typical application of the procedure described here, both the working model and the refined new AlphaFold predictions would be compared with the density map, and a new composite model incorporating the best parts of each would be created. This composite model could be used as the starting point for another iteration of model rebuilding, or if it is sufficiently complete, it could be used as a starting point for adding ligands, waters and other small molecules, and covalent modifications. If the resolution of the data is high, this model might also be modified to explicitly add alternate conformations.</p><p id="P33">This overall strategy for structure determination differs from long-established procedures at three important steps: (1) at the planning stage where AlphaFold predictions can give an idea of how challenging an experiment will be and where they can guide the design of crystallization constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, (2) at the initial structure determination stage where trimmed AlphaFold predictions can be used in molecular replacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and (3) at the model optimization stage where template-guided AlphaFold prediction may be able to improve models continuously in the analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">A central part of this overall strategy is making use of the synergy between model rebuilding and AlphaFold prediction. Using a model obtained in one cycle as a template for AlphaFold in the next cycle often leads to improvement in AlphaFold prediction, which can result in better model-building and density maps in the next cycle as well. Iteration of this procedure therefore can yield improved AlphaFold predictions, final rebuilt models, and density maps. According to our analysis, improvement of AlphaFold prediction is more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) than the improvement in density maps (as reflected in the free R value, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This is likely due to our use of long-established and very effective procedures for iterative model rebuilding with macromolecular crystallographic data during the first cycle, so that subsequent cycles have less effect on the density map and have a larger effect on the AlphaFold predictions.</p><p id="P35">We have previously taken advantage of iterating AlphaFold prediction and model rebuilding in the interpretation of density maps from cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The synergy between AlphaFold prediction and model-building is similar in the crystallographic and cryo-EM cases, but not identical. The major difference is that in the case of crystallographic data, the density map can improve dramatically, while with cryo-EM data, the density map is generally fixed. Although it might be anticipated that this would result in better AlphaFold predictions and working models by iteration with crystallographic data, our tests show that the improvement is similar for the two types of experimental methods. For crystallographic data, the median rmsd between AlphaFold predictions and matching PDB entries was reduced from 1.0 Å to 0.7 Å by iteration; for cryo-EM structures, the initial median rmsd was higher (2.5 Å), but was reduced proportionally to 1.6 Å by iteration. It seems possible that in both cases the limiting step may be model rebuilding, and with recent developments in AI-based map interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> this limitation might be greatly reduced, potentially leading to more improvement than already obtained by iteration.</p><p id="P36">Our tests of an automatic procedure for initial crystallographic structure determination demonstrate that this overall strategy is likely to be generally effective, as most of the challenging structures we analyzed could successfully be redetermined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Data and Models from the PDB</title><p id="P37">We chose models from the PDB with a goal of obtaining a representative set of challenging structures determined after the training of AlphaFold (which used structures through April, 2018). We selected all 215 unique protein-containing structures determined by the method of single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) over a 6-month period (release dates from Dec. 8, 2021 to June 29, 2022). Crystallographic data for each model were obtained from the PDB. The X-ray data typically included the anomalous data used to solve the structures, but we did not use the anomalous information (Bijvoet pairs of reflections were averaged). Some structures contained non-protein contents, such as waters, ions, small molecules, RNA, DNA, covalent modifications. All of these were removed from deposited models and were not considered in our analyses. For structural comparisons, protein chains from deposited models were superimposed on our automatically-generated models using crystallographic symmetry operations (with origin shifts, as appropriate).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Automatic structure determination with iterative AlphaFold prediction</title><p id="P38">Our procedure for automated structure determination consists of cycles of AlphaFold prediction, trimming and splitting predictions into compact domains, molecular replacement (on the first cycle), morphing full-length predictions onto the model obtained from molecular replacement or from a previous cycle, refinement, model rebuilding and trimming. These steps are described in detail below. At least three cycles are carried out, and the process is terminated when the rebuilt models for subsequent cycles have an overall rmsd to the previous model of less than 0.25 times the high-resolution limit of the X-ray data (controlled by the parameter <italic>cycle_rmsd_to_resolution_ratio</italic>). The rationale for scaling this to the resolution is that lower-resolution structures are anticipated to have larger coordinate errors.

The basis for choosing which segments (sequential sets of residues) in a model to keep included map-model comparisons and, for predicted models, predicted model confidence. Map-model comparisons consisted of comparing each residue in a model to the corresponding density map (typically the density-modified map from model rebuilding) and calculating the local map-model correlation (the correlation between map values and those in a map calculated from the model). Predicted model confidence consisted of the pLDDT values from AlphaFold prediction.</p><p id="P49">The first trimming step consisted in removing segments for which the local map correlation and (for predicted models) the pLDDT values are below their corresponding cutoff values. The map correlation and the pLDDT values were smoothed over a window of typically 10 residues (controlled by the parameter <italic>minimum_domain_length</italic>). The cutoff values are calculated from the mean and standard deviation of the highest half of the correlation (or pLDDT) values, where the cutoff is typically the mean minus three times the standard deviation (controlled by the parameter <italic>cc_sd_ratio</italic>).</p><p id="P50">The second trimming step consisted in removing residues at the segment ends that have map correlation and smoothed map correlation below a higher cutoff (typically the mean minus twice the standard deviation, controlled by the parameter <italic>cc_sd_ratio_end</italic>).
