Although the oncogenic impact of HPV encoded genes (such as E6/E7) is well known, the cis-regulatory effect of integrated HPV DNA on host chromatin structure and gene regulation remains less understood. Here, we investigate the genome-wide patterns of HPV integrations and associated host gene expression changes in the context of chromatin states and topologically associating domains (TADs). We find that HPV integrations are significantly enriched and depleted in active and inactive chromatin regions, respectively. Interestingly, regardless of the chromatin state, the genomic regions flanking HPV integrations showed transcriptional upregulation. Nevertheless, the upregulation (both local and long-range) is mostly confined to the TADs with integration and does not affect the adjacent TADs. Few TADs showed recurrent integrations associated with overexpression of oncogenes within them (such as <italic>MYC, PVT1, TP63</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>), regardless of the proximity. To further understand the long-range effect, we performed HiC and 4C-seq analyses in HeLa and observed chromatin looping interaction between the integrated HPV and <italic>MYC/PVT1</italic> regions (situated ~500 kb apart), leading to allele-specific overexpression of these genes. Again, these chromatin interactions involving integrated HPV are mostly observed within the same TAD. Together, these results suggest the cis-regulatory potential of integrated HPV DNA that drives host gene upregulation at intra-TAD level in cervical cancer. Based on this, we propose HPV integrations can trigger multimodal oncogenic activation to promote cancer progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>HPV integration</kwd><kwd>chromatin structure</kwd><kwd>topologically associating domains</kwd><kwd>gene-regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer type among women worldwide, with the majority being reported from developing and underdeveloped countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sung et al. 2021</xref>). Studies have established that most cervical cancer cases can be attributed to the persistent Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly the high-risk subtypes such as HPV16 and HPV18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bhatla et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moody and Laimins 2010</xref>). HPV contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome of size ~8 kb and it infects basal epithelial cells in the cervix. During the initial stages of infection, the HPV DNA exists in episomal form. However, over the course of epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation or neoplastic changes, the HPV DNA gets integrated into the host genome. This integration process is likely to occur at the host genomic regions sensitive to DNA strand breaks and share microhomology with the HPV DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hu et al. 2015</xref>). Large-scale genome study of cervical tumours has shown that 80% of the tumours with HPV had integration in the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Tumours with HPV DNA integration show overexpression of viral oncogenes such as E6 and E7, likely due to the perturbations or DNA breakpoints in the viral regulatory gene E2 (which controls the expression of E6/E7) or increased stability of the viral transcripts upon fusion with the host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moody and Laimins 2010</xref>). E6 and E7 proteins are known to interfere with the host p53 and RB pathways respectively, and thus favour cancer cell proliferation by avoiding apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Yim and Park 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hoppe-Seyler et al. 2018</xref>). Besides our understanding of the oncogenic roles of these viral proteins (E6/E7), efforts to delineate the cis-regulatory effects of HPV integration on the host chromatin structure and gene regulation have been rather limited.</p><p id="P4">HPV integration in the host genome can be a single or clustered (multiple nearby) event. The latter is often found together with genomic alterations (including amplification, deletion and translocations) in the nearby host regions, likely due to the HPV integration mediated DNA replication and recombination processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Akagi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">McBride and Warburton 2017</xref>). Besides, HPV integrations are associated with the upregulation of host genes which are either directly affected by the integration or in its immediate vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ojesina et al. 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies using cell lines showed that HPV integration can cause long-range effects in cis through changes in the host chromatin interactions and subsequent gene dysregulation. For example, HPV16 integration in the W12 (human cervical keratinocyte) cell line was shown to alter chromatin interactions (involving both host:host and host:viral DNA), as well as host gene expression in the nearby regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Groves et al. 2021</xref>). Similarly, in the cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, the HPV18 DNA integration in chromosome 8 was shown to have long-range chromatin interactions with the promoter region of the MYC oncogene (located approximately 500 kb away in the same chromosome) and was associated with its overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shen et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adey et al. 2013</xref>). However, the extent of these long-range chromatin interactions mediated by HPV integrations genome-wide and the associated host gene expression changes are still unexplored in cervical tumours.</p><p id="P5">Previous studies have shown that the HPV integrations from the cervical tumours and cell lines were enriched in the transcriptionally active open-chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doolittle-Hall et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bodelon et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Christiansen et al. 2015</xref>). However, these findings were based on the HPV integrations derived mostly from transcription based assays (such as RNA-seq and amplification of papillomavirus oncogene transcripts (APOT)), and thus probably have a bias towards transcriptionally active regions. Hence, a whole-genome DNA based HPV integration detection approach is required to understand the distribution of HPV integrations across the genome and to study their impact on chromatin structure and gene-regulation. Moreover, a recent PCAWG consortium study has also demonstrated the need for DNA based methods to obtain a comprehensive view of viral association with cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zapatka et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To address the aforementioned limitations, we explored the genome-wide HPV integration patterns and their impact on host gene expression in the context of chromatin states and topologically associating domains (TADs). For this, we collated genome-wide HPV integrations in cervical cancers detected using DNA based approaches and compared it with the chromatin state information from HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma) and NHEK (normal human epidermal keratinocytes) cell lines. We found that the HPV integrations are significantly enriched in active chromatin regions and depleted in inactive chromatin regions, as compared to the expected counts. Interestingly, regardless of the host chromatin state, transcriptional upregulation was observed in the immediate vicinity of the HPV integration regions (up to 10 kb). Further investigation of the long-range effects of HPV integration revealed that the TADs with integration have higher gene expression as compared to samples without integration in the same TAD. More importantly, this difference was not observed in the TADs adjacent to the HPV integrated TADs. Moreover, the recurrent HPV integration analysis at the TAD level revealed both the direct and long-range effect of HPV integration on the expression of cancer related genes (such as <italic>MYC, PVT1, TP63</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>). Additionally, we used Hi-C and 4C-seq analyses to show that the HPV integration in HeLa cells mediates long-range chromatin interactions with the oncogenes <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic>, and drives their overexpression in an allele-specific manner. Interestingly, these chromatin interactions were also mostly confined to the same TAD and not extending to the neighbouring TADs. Together, our results suggest the cis-regulatory potential of integrated HPV DNA that drives upregulation of host genes through changes in chromatin interactions (but mostly within the same TAD) in cervical cancer. This underscores that the HPV integration can mediate multiple modes of oncogenic activation and thereby acts as a strong driver conferring selective growth advantage to the cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HPV integrations are enriched in active chromatin regions and depleted in inactive chromatin regions</title><p id="P7">At first, we asked if the HPV integrations (n=617 from 212 samples) detected from the genome-wide DNA based approaches are distributed randomly or enriched in specific functional regions of the host genome. For this, we compared the HPV integration sites with ChromHMM annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ernst and Kellis 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015</xref>), which categorise the genome into broad functional annotations based on various histone modification profiles, from two closest cell lines available: HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma) and NHEK (normal human epidermal keratinocytes). To check for the enrichment, we compared the number of observed HPV integrations overlapping with each of these annotations with the expected counts computed using random sites of equal size and similar GC content (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P8">With both HeLa and NHEK ChromHMM annotations, we observed that compared to the expected, HPV integrations were significantly enriched (Chi-squared test, FDR&lt;0.05) in the transcriptionally active regions (TxFlnk, Tx, TxWk), enhancers (EnhG, Enh), and zinc finger protein gene/repeat regions (ZNF/Rpts); whereas a significant depletion (FDR&lt;0.05) was observed in polycomb repressed/heterochromatin regions (ReprPC, ReprPCWk, Het), and quiescent regions (in NHEK but not in HeLa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We further merged all the ChromHMM annotations into two major categories – active and inactive – based on the gene-regulation/chromatin activity of the regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). In both HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and NHEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), HPV integrations were significantly enriched in active regions (one-sample Chi-squared test, P &lt; 0.0001) and significantly depleted in inactive regions (P&lt;0.05) as compared to the expected counts.</p><p id="P9">Further, we checked specifically which histone modification marks associated with the above annotations are enriched with HPV integrations. We observed that the HPV integrations were significantly enriched (Chi-squared test, FDR&lt;0.05) in various active histone modification regions (such as H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac) in both HeLa and NHEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, HPV integrations were significantly depleted (FDR&lt;0.05) only in the repressive histone modification regions (H3K27me3) in both HeLa and NHEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Despite these two cell lines being different (HeLa-malignant versus NHEK-non malignant), the HPV integration patterns remain consistent. This suggests that the host cell-type specific chromatin structure influences the HPV integration patterns regardless of malignancy.</p><p id="P10">HPV integration has previously been shown to be enriched in regions of fragile sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>), which contain DNA repeats that could form non-B DNA conformations and are associated with genomic instability. To check this further, we computed the enrichment of HPV integrations in the DNA regions predicted to form non-B DNA conformations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Among all the non-B forms of DNA, only direct repeats showed significant enrichment of HPV integration as compared to the expected (Chi-squared test, FDR&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 1A</xref>). Further, to check this in the context of chromatin states, we calculated the odds ratio of observed versus expected HPV integrations in active versus inactive regions (for HeLa and NHEK, separately). This showed that even in the non-B DNA regions, integration tends to occur more frequently in the active regions as compared to inactive regions (odds ratio &gt; 1 and Fisher exact test, FDR &lt; 0.05), except for A phased repeats (with both HeLa and NHEK ChromHMM) and G quadruplex regions (only with HeLa ChromHMM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 1B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Taken together, these results suggest that HPV integrations are not randomly distributed across the genome. They are highly enriched in the active chromatin regions and depleted in repressed chromatin regions. This could be due to the combined or individual effect of DNA sequence context, DNA accessibility, DNA damage response (linked to the chromatin states) and positive selection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HPV integration affects host transcriptional activity regardless of the host chromatin state</title><p id="P12">Previous studies have shown that HPV integration can affect host gene expression in its immediate vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ojesina et al. 2014</xref>). We asked if this effect could be influenced by the host chromatin states. To test this, we used TCGA cervical cancer (CESC) samples (only WGS with matched gene expression data available, n=50) with 151 HPV integration regions and plotted the total RNA expression (both genic and non-genic elements) in the 10 kb flanking region around the integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We observed that the samples with HPV integration showed increased expression in their neighbouring 10 kb regions as compared to mean expression from the samples without HPV integration in the same region, regardless of whether the HPV integration was in an active (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.0048 for HeLa and P=7.28e-05 for NHEK) or inactive (P=0.0065 for HeLa and P=0.057 for NHEK) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 2A</xref>). Following that, we asked whether the activity of regulatory elements (like enhancers) are also enhanced around the HPV integration regions. To test this, we plotted enhancer RNA or eRNA expression (indicative of the functional activity of enhancers) from the super enhancer (SE) regions, within 10 kb on either side of the HPV integration regions in the above TCGA-CESC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 2B</xref>). We observed an increased eRNA expression in the HPV integrated samples compared to the samples without integrations. Again as shown above, it was not influenced by the chromatin state of the integrated region.</p><p id="P13">We additionally noticed that the control samples (without HPV integration) showed significantly higher expression in active as compared to inactive regions (P=0.00019 for HeLa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and P=0.00031 for NHEK, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 2A</xref>). This underscores that the ChromHMM annotations from cell lines (HeLa/NHEK) match well with the tumour tissues in terms of transcriptional activity observed in the active and inactive regions. More importantly, in samples with HPV integration, we observed a higher expression in the active as compared to the inactive regions (P=0.055 for HeLa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and P=0.0061 for NHEK, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 2A</xref>). This indicates that the HPV integration in active chromatin regions further enhances the host transcription activity in its vicinity. Further, we asked whether all HPV integrations in a sample could lead to overexpression in its immediate vicinity or not. For this, we computed the expression fold change for each HPV integration region (ratio of expression in the 10 kb flanks around integration regions with the mean expression from other samples without integration in the same region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>). This showed that the expression association with HPV integration was highly variable and not all HPV integration regions associated with higher transcriptional activity in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 2C</xref>). This could be due to the epigenetic suppression of certain integrated HPV regions or impaired regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Warburton et al. 2021a</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Taken together, these results suggest that the HPV integration leads to transcriptional upregulation and enhanced enhancer activity in its immediate vicinity, regardless of the host chromatin state. Nevertheless, the transcriptional activity associated with HPV integration was relatively higher in active chromatin regions, as compared to inactive regions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptional activity associated with HPV integration is mostly confined to the same TAD</title><p id="P15">We next asked whether the HPV integration can mediate or alter the host long-range chromatin interactions (such as enhancer-promoter or promoter-promoter), and thereby dysregulate gene expression in tumours. To test this, we compared the host gene expression at the level of TADs, obtained from HeLa and NHEK cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Rao et al. 2014</xref>). TADs act as functional units of genome organisation by restricting the interactions between regulatory elements and thereby controlling gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Rao et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li et al. 2018</xref>). TAD boundaries are commonly bound by insulator proteins like CTCF that prevent interactions across the TADs. We hypothesised that the transcriptional overexpression associated with the HPV integration would be majorly restricted to the TADs where the HPV integration is localised. To test this, we plotted the average gene expression at the TAD level in the TCGA-CESC samples with HPV integration and compared it with the mean expression from samples without integration in the same TAD (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We further extended this analysis to the immediate upstream (5') and downstream (3') TADs for comparison. Only the TADs with HPV integration showed overall increased expression compared to the samples without integration (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 3A</xref>). However, neither the upstream nor the downstream neighbouring TADs showed any effect at TAD level expression of genes (P&gt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Further, we asked whether increase in the number of integrations in a TAD would result in more perturbations in gene regulation and overexpression. For this, we separated TADs based on whether they had 1, 2, or more than 2 integrations and compared the TAD level gene expression among them, along with the samples without integration. This showed that indeed an increase in the number of integrations in a TAD was associated with an increase in gene overexpression as compared to the samples without integration in the same TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Direct HPV integration in the host genes (or fusions) can lead to overexpression of the target genes. To remove the influence of these, we repeated the above analysis after removing the genes which were directly overlapping with the HPV integration sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that the gene expression was higher in the TADs with integration as compared to samples without integration (P=3.36e-08), albeit slightly lower than the above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This trend was consistent even after removing the genes which were either directly overlapping an integration or within 10 kb region flanking the integration (P=2.22e-07) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting the long-range cis-regulatory potential of the HPV integration.</p><p id="P18">Taken together, these results indicate the potential of HPV integration to enhance expression of nearby host genes but mostly within the same TAD, likely due to the constraint imposed by the TAD boundaries or genome organisation. Further, within the TAD, the overexpression observed could come from both the direct and long-range effect of HPV integration on target genes through chromatin contacts in 3D nuclear space.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Recurrent HPV integrations in TADs are associated with oncogene overexpression</title><p id="P19">Recurrent HPV integrations near cancer related genes (such as MYC and TP63) have been previously reported in cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hu et al. 2015</xref>). In those studies, the recurrence was defined mostly based on the HPV integration directly overlapping with or in close proximity (at a defined distance cut-off) of the target genes. This can potentially miss out the integrations that are far away and can have a long range effect on the target genes. To overcome this, we performed recurrent integration analysis at the TAD level. For this analysis, we considered HPV integrations (n=1324 from 326 samples) collated from both DNA-based studies (WGS, WXS and Hybrid capture) and RNA-seq (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). The TADs which had HPV integration in at least three samples were considered recurrent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This showed that TAD3189 and TAD2252 were the top two most recurrently integrated TADs. Interestingly, these TADs also exhibited mutually exclusive patterns of HPV integration, indicating that these recurrent TADs were not affected in the same patients. Moreover, we found that certain HPV subtypes were frequently integrated in specific TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). HPV16 was predominantly observed in TAD3189 (13/22), TAD2252 (11/15), TAD1333 (5/5) and TAD2320 (2/3), whereas HPV18 was predominant in TAD1369 (3/6). In the TAD3189, we observed both HPV16 and HPV18, however, the proportion of HPV18 was much higher (41%) as compared to the overall HPV18 proportion (16%) in TCGA-CESC (Chi-squared test, P=0.011).</p><p id="P20">To further understand if the recurrent HPV integrations are associated with tumorigenesis, we looked at the presence of cancer related genes (from Cancer Gene Census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sondka et al. 2018</xref>) and Cancer LncRNA Census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carlevaro-Fita et al. 2020</xref>)) in these TADs. Interestingly, TAD3189 harbours multiple important coding (<italic>MYC</italic>) and non-coding (<italic>PVT1</italic> and <italic>CCAT1</italic>) oncogenes. Overexpression of these oncogenes have been previously reported in cervical cancers and were also associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Narisawa-Saito et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Iden et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shen et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, to test if HPV integration in TAD3189 is affecting the expression of these oncogenes, we divided the TCGA-CESC samples into two groups, one which had integration in TAD3189 and other which did not. Expression of both <italic>MYC</italic> (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and <italic>PVT1</italic> (P=0.010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) was significantly higher in the samples with integration in TAD3189 as compared to samples without integration in TAD3189. Similarly in TAD2252, <italic>TP63</italic> (oncogene) expression was higher (P=0.057) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) in samples with integration in TAD2252. In TAD1333, <italic>ERBB2</italic> (oncogene) expression was significantly higher (P=0.0007) in samples with integration, whereas <italic>CDK12</italic> (tumour suppressor gene) in the same TAD did not show any change in expression (P=0.27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Also, <italic>RAD51B</italic> (tumour suppressor gene) in TAD996 did not show any change in expression level (P=0.52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that the HPV integration preferentially enhances the expression of oncogenes in these recurrent TADs. Interestingly, in these TADs (TAD3189 and TAD2252) with oncogenes, increased gene expression (z-score&gt;0; above the average expression level across samples) was evident regardless of whether the HPV integration occurred directly at the gene or further away in the respective TADs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the HPV integration can affect gene expression both locally and at longer distances.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>HPV18 induced chromatin interactions in HeLa are confined locally and target oncogenes</title><p id="P21">Next, we asked whether the long distance effect of HPV integration on the oncogene expression in the above recurrent TADs could be mediated by chromatin looping. To study this, we chose the HeLa cell line (as a model) which has HPV18 integration in TAD3189 (chromosome 8), the most frequently HPV integrated TAD in cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To obtain an unbiased and global overview of all the genomic interactions between the integrated HPV DNA and the host genome, we leveraged the available HiC data from HeLa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yardimci et al. 2019</xref>), which captures overall genomic interaction at a particular resolution (or regions that are in close proximity in 3D space). For the Hi-C data analysis, we used the full length HPV18 genome (treated as a separate chromosome) along with human chromosomes, and mapped reads to compute the contact frequency (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P22">First, we looked at the chromosome level to identify which of the chromosomes have contacts with the integrated HPV18 DNA. This showed that the majority of the contacts involving HPV18 were associated with chromosome 8 (chromosome with HPV18 integration), followed by intra-HPV18 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, to gain further insights into these contacts with chromosome 8, we plotted the contact frequency (per kb) with the HPV18 for all the TADs on chromosome 8. This showed that the highest number of contacts with the integrated HPV18 DNA were observed with genomic regions in TAD3189, where the HPV integration localised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, TAD3189 also had the highest coverage of reads (per kb) for the interaction between genomic regions on chromosome 8 and HPV18. This signifies that the interaction frequency between integrated HPV18 DNA and TAD3189 was much higher as compared to other TADs on the same chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 5B, C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the chromatin interactions driven by the integrated HPV18 are mostly confined to the same TAD containing the HPV18 integration, thus possibly supporting the TAD level upregulation of genes observed in tumours (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We wanted to further understand the specific host regions which looped with the integrated HPV18 with a high frequency. For this, we selected the top 1% genomic bins (10 kb) from chromosome 8 with the highest frequency of interaction with HPV18, and overlapped them with the gene coordinates on the same chromosome. This resulted in the detection of 8 genes (<italic>RP11-255B23.4, CCAT1, CASC8, RP11-382A18.3, RP11-382A18.2, CASC11, MYC, PVT1</italic>) and all of them were located in the TAD3189 region. Of these, three are known oncogenes (<italic>CCAT1, MYC and PVT1</italic>). Further, we focused on the promoter region of these three oncogenes and observed that their interaction with HPV18 (among other regions on chromosome 8) was in top 1 percentile for <italic>CCAT1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> and top 2 percentile for PVT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This indicates a high frequency of chromatin interactions between these oncogenes and also their promoters with the integrated HPV18 DNA in HeLa.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>4C-seq reveals haplotype-specific chromatin looping between integrated HPV18 and host genome</title><p id="P24">To further characterise the chromatin looping interaction mediated by the HPV18 integration at the local scale with higher resolution, we performed a 4C-seq experiment with the integrated HPV18 DNA as an anchor point in HeLa. At first, we wanted to check the extent of HPV integration induced chromatin interactions at the TAD level. For this, we plotted per bp coverage of 4C-seq reads in TAD3189 (with HPV integration) and in the neighbouring TADs (4 upstream and 4 downstream). Most of the 4C-seq signal was observed from the TAD with HPV integration similar to Hi-C analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 6A, B</xref>). Even though the HPV integration was found near the left boundary of TAD3189, the coverage of reads in the immediate upstream TAD was quite low. This suggests the role of chromatin structure (TAD boundaries) in confining the regulatory effects of the integrated HPV DNA within the same TAD predominantly. Further within the TAD3189, higher level of interaction was observed between the integrated HPV18 and all the three oncogenes (<italic>CCAT1, MYC and PVT1</italic>) in that TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, 4C track). This further supports the previous studies which showed an interaction between HPV18 and <italic>MYC</italic> locus using ChIA-PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adey et al. 2013</xref>) and 3C analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shen et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In HeLa, integration of HPV18 is observed in only one of the two haplotypes of chromosome 8. Based on this, we hypothesised that the chromatin interaction observed between the integrated HPV18 DNA and the host genome could be haplotype-specific. To check this, we performed haplotype-specific 4C-seq coverage analysis, using heterozygous SNPs (as marker positions) from the HeLa genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). This revealed that almost all reads from the 4C-seq (~99-100%) mapped to the allele from the Haplotype A (which has the HPV integration) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 6C, D</xref>). This suggests that the HPV integration mediated chromatin interactions are not only localised mostly within the same TAD but are also haplotype specific.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Haplotype-specific cis-regulating activity of HPV integration is associated with allele-specific oncogenes overexpression</title><p id="P26">Further, we asked if the above haplotype-specific chromatin looping interaction could lead to haplotype-specific regulatory changes and gene expression alterations. To check this, we performed haplotype-specific analysis for RNA polymerase II (Pol2) binding on chromosome 8 in HeLa. This resulted in three peaks of Pol2 in the TAD3189 which showed significant haplotype-specific binding to Haplotype A (&gt;98% reads from Haplotype A in all 3), as compared to the expected proportion based on DNA copy number. Interestingly, these peaks overlapped with the <italic>CCAT1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> genes and also the super-enhancer overlapping the HPV integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, Pol2 peaks (HapA) track), suggesting that the integrated HPV DNA drives gene regulation in haplotype specific manner. Further, we asked if this results in preferential expression of genes from the haplotype with HPV integration. To test this, we performed allele-specific gene expression analysis (taking into account the DNA copy number) on chromosome 8 in HeLa. This revealed <italic>MYC</italic> having significantly higher expression from Haplotype A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). The other oncogenic lncRNAs in the TAD3189, <italic>CCAT1</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic>, also showed a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further, we performed allele-specific gene expression analysis at the TAD level, combining all the genes in a TAD together. It also revealed TAD3189 to have the significantly higher expression from haplotype A among all the TADs on chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results are in line with the TAD specific chromatin interactions (from Hi-C and 4C-seq) reported above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Fig 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">A recent study has reported that HPV integrations are enriched in super-enhancers (SE) which ultimately control lineage determining genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>). Hence, we asked whether the HPV18 integration in HeLa affects the SE activity on chromosome 8. TAD3189 also harbours multiple SEs, one of which overlaps HPV integration. Interestingly, this SE is the most strongest in terms of signal (enhancer marks) on chromosome 8, and the third most strongest across the genome in HeLa (SEdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jiang et al. 2019</xref>)). Allele-specific expression analysis using GRO-seq data revealed this SE in TAD3189 to be the most significantly and highly expressed from Haplotype A among all the SEs on chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the HPV integration in chromosome 8 lead to changes in regulatory activity and chromatin interactions, resulting in allele-specific expression of SE and oncogenes within the same TAD (TAD3189).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">HPV DNA integration into the host nuclear DNA is often found in the tumours of advanced cervical cancers, as compared to their early stages where the HPV is mostly present in the episomal form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Warburton et al. 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moody and Laimins 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Daniel et al. 1997</xref>). Thus, the HPV DNA integration is considered as an important oncogenic event in the transformation and progression of cervical cancer, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this is not yet fully understood. On one hand, it can be attributed to the overexpression of viral oncogenes (E6 and E7) from the integrated HPV DNA which could affect the cellular functions (such as cell proliferation and immune response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Yim and Park 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rodrigues et al. 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the integrated HPV DNA itself can affect expression of nearby host genes in cis and thereby contribute to tumour development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ojesina et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Groves and Coleman 2018</xref>). However, the extent of the latter at the genome-wide level, particularly in the context of host chromatin structure, is not well understood. Thus, in this study, we attempted to investigate the impact of HPV integration on host chromatin structure and gene regulation genome-wide, by using the HPV integration from cervical tumour samples combined with the chromatin structure information from closest matching cancer and normal cell lines.</p><p id="P29">First, we showed that the distribution of HPV integrations across the genome is nonrandom. They are significantly enriched in the active chromatin regions and depleted in the inactive chromatin regions. Though these results are consistent with the previous meta-analysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doolittle-Hall et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bodelon et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schmitz et al. 2012</xref>), our analysis tried to remove any bias emerging from the integration detection methods (such as RNA-seq and APOT) by considering only whole-genome DNA based assays. Additionally, for the enrichment analysis, random integration sites were generated by matching the GC content around the observed HPV integration sites to account for the influence of local sequence content (since the HPV integration processes are associated with microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hu et al. 2015</xref>)). This approach is robust as compared to the previous studies which used uniform random distributions. Still the significant enrichment of HPV integration observed at the active chromatin regions in the cervical tumours could be explained by multiple factors acting prior to and/or during the clonal selection. Prior events may include the closer proximity of the episomal HPV DNA to the active chromatin regions due to the interaction between viral E2 protein and host BRD4 chromatin proteins (likely for the utilisation of host transcription/replication factors for viral transcription and replication), DNA breaks at the transcriptionally active regions due to replication-transcription conflicts or torsional stress, DNA repair and microhomology between the HPV and host DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Warburton et al. 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hu et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Canela et al. 2017</xref>). All these factors can favour the accidental integration of HPV DNA into the host genome. After that, if the host locus of the HPV integration is favourable for the expression of viral oncogenes (E6/E7) and also for upregulation of nearby host genes (especially oncogenes discussed below) that provides the selective growth advantage and favours the clonal expansion, then these integrations are likely to undergo positive selection.</p><p id="P30">Second, we observed that the transcriptional upregulation in the flanking region (upto 10 kb) of HPV integration was evident in both active and inactive chromatin regions. This could be due to the local genomic alterations (amplifications/translocations) associated with the HPV integration, and also changes in the local chromatin environment. For example, the host transcription factors can bind to the integrated HPV DNA and thereby increase the local chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Johannsen and Lambert 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karimzadeh et al.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gagliardi et al. 2020</xref>) and subsequently upregulate the expression of nearby host genes. Alternatively, this can be due to the fusion of nearby host genes with the viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>). Also, it is possible that the HPV integration at host regulatory regions (such as enhancers) could lead to the formation of super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Warburton et al. 2018</xref>) and thereby enhance the expression of host genes. Our findings expand this observation in cervical cancers as we observed a higher expression of SE eRNAs in the immediate vicinity of the HPV integration regions, regardless of the host chromatin state.</p><p id="P31">Third, we explored the long-range effect of HPV integration on expression of the host genes. For this, instead of defining arbitrary length cut-offs around the integration sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>), we used TAD boundaries as demarcation points. Overall, we found that the TADs with HPV integration showed higher gene expression as compared to samples without integration in the same TADs. And this upregulation is positively correlated with the number of HPV integrations within the TAD. However, genes in the neighbouring TADs were mostly unaffected. This may be due to the fact that the host chromatin structure is influencing the HPV associated genomic alterations (amplification/translocation) during the integration processes or limiting the HPV integration mediated chromatin interaction changes to intra-TAD because of the insulation property of TAD boundaries. Recent studies have shown that HPV integration can cause changes in the local TAD structures in advanced cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cao et al. 2020</xref>) and also in human cell lines: HPV16 integration in W12 (prior to clonal selection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Groves et al. 2021</xref>) and HPV16 integration in SiHA cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Xu et al. 2021</xref>). Our results further extend this observation genome-wide in cervical tumours and show that the majority of the HPV integration induced chromatin changes and associated gene expression changes are mostly confined to the same TAD.</p><p id="P32">We found few loci with recurrent HPV integration at the TAD level and were associated with overexpression of oncogenes within them. Further, looking at the distribution of HPV integration within these TADs revealed that the expression of oncogenes (such as <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic>) were not only affected by HPV integration directly at or closer to these genes, but also by integration farther away (~500 kb) but within the same TAD. To further understand the mode of regulation of these oncogenes by HPV integration, we chose HeLa as the model system as it had the integration in the most recurrently integrated TAD3189 in cervical tumours. Previous studies have shown chromatin interaction between the integrated HPV DNA and the <italic>MYC</italic> gene (~500 kb away from the integration) by using ChIA-PET and 3C assays in HeLa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adey et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shen et al. 2017</xref>). However, whether this interaction is localised and specific to <italic>MYC</italic> regions or the integrated HPV DNA can interact with other genomic regions is not known. Our unbiased analysis, by using available Hi-C data from HeLa, revealed that the majority of the chromatin interactions were localised within the same chromosome, specifically within the same TAD as integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Further, 4C-seq analysis by taking integrated HPV DNA as a viewpoint, showed haplotype-specific chromatin interaction between integrated HPV DNA and host genomic regions in HeLa. This is further supported by the allele-specific RNA pol II binding enrichment, super enhancer activity and overexpression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic> genes within the TAD3189. This allele-specific activity can be extrapolated to the cervical tumour samples as well, because TAD3189 is the most recurrently integrated TAD among cervical tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), and we also observed the overexpression of oncogenes <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic> within them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). We propose that this may be one of the many ways by which HPV integration influences the process of tumorigenesis, as role of both of these oncogenes along with the CCAT1 in cervical carcinogenesis have already been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Iden et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Narisawa-Saito et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P33">The limitations of this study include: (a) The HPV integrations we analysed were mostly detected from the advanced stage cervical tumours, thus their genome-wide distribution with respect to the chromatin states observed here could be influenced by the factors acting prior and during the clonal selection. Future studies which test for de novo HPV integration (for example, by using cell line either infected with HPV or genome-wide profiling of early stage cervical tumours) might shed light on the interplay between viral and host factors which drives the integration processes and associated chromatin changes, (b) the overexpression of host regions observed near the HPV integration in active and inactive regions could have contributions from the extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), which have a hybrid of viral-host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>). Perhaps in future, the application of long-read DNA/RNA sequencing could help to disentangle the DNA structural conformations of HPV integrations and better quantify the contributions from the ecDNA, (c) the TADs from cell lines HeLa and NHEK covers only 47.5% and 56% of the genome respectively, and so we were limited to analyse those HPV integration that fall within that TAD region. Chromatin interactions maps from the matched tumour samples could help to better understand the long-range effect of HPV integrations genome-wide and also to study the changes of the TAD structure (whether the integration lead to split of existing TAD or merging of adjacent TADs).</p><p id="P34">To conclude, this study reveals the cis-regulatory potential of HPV integration on the host gene dysregulation through changes in the host chromatin structure and generegulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). On the basis of our results and previous findings we propose that HPV integration is a strong driver which mediates multiple modes of dysregulation (including overexpression of E6/E7 viral oncogene, cis-regulatory effect of HPV integrations, local copy number changes, and amplification of regulatory elements) that can affect the host cellular functioning and thereby providing selective growth advantages to the cancer cells. This study also demonstrates that TADs can be used to identify host genes at a distance that are likely to be affected by the HPV integrations through looping or chromatin contacts, instead of arbitrary distance cut-offs. This will help to identify more recurrent integrations at the TAD level and also to associate orphan HPV integrations with new target genes. Moreover, our findings reveal the significance of insulated neighbourhoods in the form of TADs and their key role in safeguarding the genome from spurious transcriptional changes driven by viral integrations.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>HPV integrations</title><p id="P35">We collated HPV integrations in cervical cancer patient samples from previous studies (including TCGA-CESC and others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Warburton et al. 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen et al. 2018</xref>).

A hybrid hg19-HPV18 genome, considering the HPV18 genome as an additional ‘chromosome’, was constructed (human genome version: GRCh37.75, HPV18 version: NC_001357.1; the HPV18 genome orientation was reversed, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adey et al. 2013</xref>). The hybrid hg19-HPV18 genome was indexed with bwa v0.7.17 ‘index’ mode and samtools v1.6 ‘faidx’. Hi-C reads from each of the replicates were mapped separately to the hybrid genome using bwa (v0.7.17, ‘mem’ mode, parameters: -t 20 -E 50 -L 0 -v 0). Filtering of reads was done based on mapping parameters (min mapq=1, samtools view -Sb -q 1 -F 256). After intersecting reads with HINDIII intervals and removing self ligation and duplicate pairs, replicates were pooled together. HiCExplorer (v2.1.1) was used to obtain the contact list and the contact matrices at 10 kb resolution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS157797-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d83aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS157797-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of RS and DN lab for feedback and suggestions.

HPV integration can lead to local chromatin changes resulting in transcriptional upregulation of host genes (also in fusion with viral genes) in its vicinity.
