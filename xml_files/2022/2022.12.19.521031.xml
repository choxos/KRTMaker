To achieve the speed and sensitivity needed to detect and follow individual molecules, these experiments typically require custom-built microscopes or custom modifications of commercial systems. The costs of such single-molecule microscopes, their technical complexity and the lack of open-source documentation on how to build custom setups therefore limit the accessibility of single-molecule imaging techniques. To advance the adaptation of dynamic single-molecule imaging by a wider community, we present the “K2”: an open-source, simultaneous triple-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope specifically designed for live-cell and single-molecule imaging. We explain our design considerations and provide step-by-step building instructions, parts list and full CAD models. The flexible design of this TIRF microscope allows users to customize it to their scientific and financial needs, or to re-use parts of our design to improve the capabilities of their existing setups without necessarily having to build a full copy of the K2 microscope.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Commercially available fluorescence microscopes for state-of-the-art single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy are often expensive to acquire and lack the flexibility to incorporate custom features beyond already available add-ons. In recent years, a number of open-source projects originated within the super-resolution fluorescence microscopy community, facilitating the design and construction of custom microscopes from the bottom-up. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Additionally, stand-alone solutions for various sub-components of single-molecule microscopes have been published as open source hardware projects (<italic>e.g</italic>. focus stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], laser sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], objective heaters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and beam-shaping devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]). Our microscope design builds on previous opensource projects and our in-house engineering expertise, to provide a cost-effective and flexible solution for single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present a single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope that is capable of acquiring dynamic single-molecule data with four-color excitation and simultaneous triple-color detection. The microscope uses a single sCMOS camera and projects the fluorescence emission coming from the sample onto different camera regions for each fluorescence channel. Together with homogeneous illumination from a beamshaping device, this enables simultaneous three-color imaging with large fields of view (73 μmx73 μm) for each channel. The microscope further features objective heating, a plexiglass cover with an integrated LED array for brightfield illumination, and motorized switching of the angle of the excitation laser beam from TIRF to highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) and epifluorescence. Finally, the microscope also includes a flip-in lens for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments and a focus stabilization system to correct axial sample drift in timelapse and multi-position measurements.</p><p id="P5">To ensure reliability and reproducibility of experiments, all imaging settings (<italic>e.g</italic>. laser power, exposure time, stage position, angle of incidence …) are carefully documented for every dataset. We also monitor and record environmental parameters (temperature, humidity) and the axial sample drift when using the focus stabilization system. This allows us to precisely control and replicate our experiments under identical imaging conditions, which is essential for generating comparable and reproducible data with TIRF microscopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Setup description</title><p id="P6">The K2 single-molecule TIRF microscope is comprised of a central cube with the sample stage, sample holder and objective (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and panel I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), as well as two enclosed boxes. The box on the right-hand side of the central cube houses the excitation path optics and the focus lock system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and panel II and III in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The box to the left contains the detection pathway, where emitted fluorescence light from the sample is split in up to three spectrally separated channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and panel IV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The excitation and detection pathways are enclosed in light-tight aluminum boxes to reduce background light levels, minimize laser safety issues, and prevent dust buildup. The entire setup is mounted on a vibration-damped optical table, with additional components (<italic>e.g</italic>. pre-assembled laser-combiner box, panel V in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the setup control computer located nearby.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="box" rules="all"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Hardware name</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle">K2: Open-source simultaneous triple-color TIRF microscope for live-cell and single-molecule imaging</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Subject area</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle">Single-molecule Biophysics, Fluorescence Microscopy</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Hardware type</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle">Imaging tool: Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscope</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Open source license</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle">CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Cost of hardware</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle">137,000 €</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Source file repository</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/7380380#.Y-3EqU9ByCg">10.5281/zenodo.7380380</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"><bold>Homepage</bold></td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ganzingerlab.github.io/K2TIRF/K2TIRF/index.html">ganzingerlab.github.io/K2TIRF/K2TIRF/index.html</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="S3"><title>Microscope body</title><p id="P7">The K2 single-molecule TIRF microscope is a custom-designed instrument that does not use a conventional microscope body (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The central part is a solid, CNC-milled aluminum block, based on the miCube project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The cube houses the objective, sample stage, dichroic mirror and tube lens. Unlike traditional commercial microscopes, the K2 does not include an objective turret or ocular, as they are not required for our experiments. This design results in a smaller footprint and excellent mechanical stability.</p><p id="P8">A high numerical aperture oil-immersion objective (NA=1.49, CFI Apochromat TIRF, Nikon) with 60x magnification is mounted on a polyoxymethylene spacer to provide thermal isolation from the cube. A polyimide flexible heater, wrapped around the objective with Kapton foil, and a PT100 temperature sensor glued in place, enable precise temperature control via a proportional-integral-derivative(PID) controller(E5CC, Omron). This design is similarto othercustom-madeand commercial designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and allows for active heating of the sample, which is thermally coupled to the objective via immersion oil. This enables live-cell imaging and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments at physiological temperatures.</p><p id="P9">The sample stage of the K2 single-molecule TIRF microscope is equipped with a three-axis piezo stick-slip positioner (SLS-5252, Smaract) and a two-piece aluminum sample holder that accommodates square (18mm to 26mm side length), circular (25mm to 37mm diameter) and rectangular (62mm to 80mm length, up to 35mm width) samples. Samples are held in place with magnets or an aluminum ring to minimize sample drift. The stage is controlled via the computer or a handheld joystick controller (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and accurately positions samples with nanometer resolution and 30mm travel range in all directions, allowing for high-throughput measurements of multi-well coverslides.</p><p id="P10">The excitation laser beam enters the central cube through a port on the right-hand side and is reflected upwards towards the objective by a dichroic mirror. Residual transmitted laser light is absorbed by a neutral density filter mounted on the dichroic mirror cube. Emitted fluorescence collected by the objective is transmitted through the dichroic mirror and reflected via a mirror towards the exit port on the left-hand side of the cube. A four-bandpass emission filter on the mirror mount blocks remaining laser excitation light from reaching the detection pathway. The dichroic mirror and the right-angle mirror are accessible through a door on the front of the cube, which is held in place with magnets.</p><p id="P11">The central cube is enclosed by a plexiglass cover that protects the sample and objective from dust buildup and improves temperature stability by minimizing convective air transport. A sensor for temperature and humidity is placed inside the plexiglass box and records the environmental parameters during experiments. The lid of the plexiglass cover includes a LED ring for brightfield imaging of cellular targets. For laser safety considerations, potential adopters of our design may consider using a non-transparent cover.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Excitation pathway</title><p id="P12">The excitation pathway is mounted on an elevated breadboard (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), which helps to keep the length of posts short for stability. Spacers (39.7mm height) were used to raise the breadboard (12.7mm thickness) to the required level, resulting in final beam heights of 65 mm in both the excitation pathway and the detection pathway. In principle, the beam can be brought up to the required height also by using long enough posts or a periscope-assembly.</p><p id="P13">We use a commercial pre-assembled laser combiner with a single-mode fiber output for delivering four excitation wavelengths (C-FLEX laser combiner, Hübner Photonics; 405 nm 140mW, 488 nm 200 mW, 561 nm 220 mW, 638 nm 195 mW) to the excitation pathway. Laser excitation is controlled by a custom-made laser trigger box, that allows alternating and simultaneous excitation synchronized to the camera exposure. Other approaches to laser triggering include the open-source NicoLase and SMILE projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], as well as the commercial Triggerscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P14">TheTEM00 laserbeam is re-collimated after exiting the fiber to a 1/e<sup>2</sup> beam diameter of 6 mm (@ 561 nm), directed through a quad-line bandpass for spectral clean-up, and an achromatic quarterwavelength waveplate to ensure circular polarisation. The Gaussian laser beam profile is transformed into a flat-top profile using a refractive beam shaping device (piShaper 6_6_VIS, AdlOptica, comparable alternative: TopShape TSM25-10-D-B-6, asphericon) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. A (removable) telescope magnifies the laser beam by a factor of 2.5, resulting in a beam diameter of 15 mm. The flat-top profile of the laser beam begins to distort as it propagates over longer distances, so we designed the setup to keep the distance between the beam shaper and the objective as short as possible.</p><p id="P15">For FRAP experiments, an additional lens on a motorized flip-mount can be inserted into the optical path after the telescope, focusing the excitation laser into a 30μm diameter spot in the imaging plane.</p><p id="P16">To enable switching between imaging modes (epifluorescence, HILO- and TIRF-imaging, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12d</xref>), the lens focusing the laser beam onto the back focal plane of the objective is mounted on a motorized stage that allows the beam to be translated off-axis while maintaining its parallel alignment with the objective’s optical axis.</p><p id="P17">The lens that focuses the excitation beam onto the back focal plane of the objective is placed as close to the back focal plane as possible, which allows using a lens with a shorter focal length and therefore a bigger illuminated area at the sample plane. Using a telescope with a higher magnification to achieve an equally-sized illuminated area would result in clipping the laser beam, unless larger optics are used throughout the excitation path. To provide more flexibility in the arrangement of the optical elements, future versions of the central cube could be designed with a reduced distance between the objective port and excitation entry port. With the current design, our setup allows for a maximum homogeneously illuminated diameter of 190 μm.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Detection pathway</title><p id="P18">The detection pathway is designed under the assumption that the microscope will mostly be used in a triple-color simultaneous imaging mode (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Using a single camera to capture three color channels simultaneously is more cost-effective than using three separate cameras, and com bining a 60x objective without additional magnification with a 2048x2048 px sCMOS chip allows us to achieve large field-of-views (73.65 μm x 73.65 μm per color channel) nevertheless. To achieve even larger field-of-views, the triple-color detection pathway can be bypassed by placing two mirrors on pre-installed magnetic mounts, resulting in a circular field of view of 190 μm diameter. A commercial alternative for image splitting is the OptoSplit (Cairn Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]).</p><p id="P19">As described in the section about the central cube, fluorescence emission from the sample is collected by the objective, passes the quad-bandpass dichroic mirror in the cube and is reflected towards the detection pathway. A quad-line filter blocks residual excitation light from reaching the detection pathway. Emission fluorescence is directed through an infinity-corrected tube lens matching the objective, without further magnification (TTL200-A, Thorlabs). With the camera’s physical pixel size of 6.5 μm, this results in an effective pixel size of 6.5 μm/60 = 108.3 nm.</p><p id="P20">In the triple-color imaging mode, the image of the fluorescent sample is cropped horizontally by a custom razorblade slit aperture in an intermediate image plane. This is necessary to avoid overlapping of the color channels when imaging them side-by-side on the camera chip (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S29</xref>). Splitting the fluorescence emission into the different spectral channelsand filtering them is done in infinity space in a 4f-configuration. This reduces aberrations and allows more mechanical freedom, since the distance of the second to the first 4f-lens is not critical.</p><p id="P21">The first 4f-lens is positioned to have its focal plane aligned with the image plane formed by the tube lens. Then, the fluorescence emission is split into three colors by two low-pass dichroic mirrors, matched to the four-bandpass dichroic mirror in the cube, and one dielectric mirror. Furthermore, appropriate bandpass filters are placed in each color channel. Individual lenses mounted on rails and dovetail stages project the images of each color channel next to each other on the camera. The use of individual lenses allows precise co-alignment of the image planes and the correction of residual chromatic aberrations. A dielectric mirror is used in each color channel to project the spectrally-separated images onto the camera chip. Finally, three equally-sized square field-of-views are created by cropping the camera chip horizontally. By cropping in line with the scanning of the sCMOS chip, we are able to reduce the read-out time from 22.6 ms (full chip, 2048x2048) to 7.6ms (central region, 2048x682). At a typical framerate of 25 fps, this approximately doubles the exposure time per frame (32.4 ms/17.1 ms ≈ 1.89).</p><p id="P22">The optical path for the image splitter was designed to be as compact as possible to minimize vignetting, while at the same time allowing component accessibility for alignment. Additionally, projecting the image onto the camera at an angle introduces aberrations, therefore the individual focusing lenses and the mirrors are placed as close to each other as possible. As a consequence, this maximizes the distance between the last mirror and the camera and hence decreases the angles at which images are projected from the left and right color channel.</p><p id="P23">In the single-color imaging mode, the full 190 μm diameter illuminated field-of-view is imaged with spatially unseparated color channels. This is accomplished by bypassing the slit aperture and the image splitting pathway using two mirrors, that are placed manually on kinematic magnetic mounts. The first mirror is placed after the tube lens and the second mirror before the camera. Two lenses relay the image in a 4f-system, which conveniently also allows the placement of additional components like filters or phase masks in the fourier plane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S28</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Focus stabilization pathway</title><p id="P24">In microscopy in general, but specifically in super-resolution and single-molecule experiments and timelapses, sample drift can significantly degrade the quality of the recorded data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In live-cell and single-molecule tracking experiments, lateral drift of the sample usually does not interfere with the experiments as the typical drifting appears on much slower timescales than the molecular movement apparent in the sample (lateral sample drift in our setup: ≈ 1 nm min<sup>-1</sup>, diffusion of individual receptor proteins in cell membranes: ≈ 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> to 1 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p id="P25">Movement of the sample along the optical axis (axial drift), however, leads to a shift of the focal plane. Since in TIRF microscopy, fluorescence is only emitted from a thin layer close to the coverslip, this shift leads to a decreased signal-to-background ratio due to the defocus blurring of the point spread function, or even the loss of the object that the user initially focused on. Therefore, keeping the sample in focus is crucial, especially when performing long measurements and timelapses, or repeated acquisitions on different areas on a sample.</p><p id="P26">One way to measure and control the distance of the sample from the objective is to use the back-reflection of the excitation laser, with the drawback that measuring and updating the <italic>z</italic>-position can only be done during the excitation cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. A dedicated infrared laser is a more versatile option, as it does not excite commonly used fluorescent proteins and dyes, allowing for continuous measurement and control of the sample’s axial position without interfering with fluorescence measurements.</p><p id="P27">The principle of the focus stabilization is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>. First, the sample is brought into focus manually and the position of the back-reflected beam is stored. Axial drift Δ<italic>z</italic> of the sample leads to a lateral displacement Δ<italic>d</italic> of the totally internally reflected infrared laser beam. The back-reflected laser beam is relayed through additional optics, resulting in a displacement Δ<italic>d’</italic>, that is determined by comparing the center peaks of the previously saved reference and the currently measured laser profiles on a line-array sensor. To mechanically compensate for the axial drift, an active control mechanism reacts to the lateral displacement and moves the sample stage to keep the position of the back-reflected beam stable.</p><p id="P28">Our focus lock implementation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>), qgFocus (short for <bold>q</bold>uite <bold>g</bold>ood Focus), is similar to other custom-built and commercial designs such as pgFocus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] or CRISP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]: A collimated infrared laser is coupled into the excitation path by a short pass dichroic mirror and attenuated with a neutral density filter so that it does not interfere with the fluorescence signals. A manual micrometer stage is used to shift the infrared laser beam off-axis, bringing it into total internal reflection. The infrared laser is then focused at the back focal plane, reflected at the glass-sample interface, and travels back towards a beamsplitter. The back-reflected laser beam is diverted by the beamsplitter towards a bandpass filter and finally focused onto a linescan sensor (TSL1401, Parallax). The intensity curve is registered and fitted with a Gaussian function. A control loop that locks onto the saved in-focus position of the Gaussian function center then moves the piezo-driven sample stage in the axial direction to maintain focus. In our system, manual sample travel in <italic>x-y</italic> during focus-controlled experiments is limited to 100 μm s<sup>-1</sup> to avoid jumps in the back-reflected beam position that cannot be followed by the control loop.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Scripts</title><p id="P29">Our microscope control software includes a script interface that allows users to control the setup and perform various tasks using C++ commands.

However, if this step needs to be deferred and another laser source is available (<italic>f.i</italic>. the Gustafsson alignment tool), it is possible to begin with the central cube and the detection pathway, since the excitation and detection pathways can largely be assembled and aligned independently of each other. In addition to commonly used alignment tools such as viewing disks, reticles, irises, and calibration slides, we use a cage system mounted on the objective port to simplify the alignment of the excitation path, and the Gustafsson alignment tool for the detection path alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The Gustafsson alignment tool is a small diode laser aligned in a mount that is screwed into the objective thread. The wavelength should be situated within one of the fluorescence emission bands, <italic>e.g</italic>. in the GFP-like emission band between 500 nm and 550 nm. This allows the alignment laser to pass through the emission dichroic mirror, and, if alignment is performed in the correct order, the laser beam can be used to align the entire detection pathway.

The Start/Stop buttons can be used to activate or stop the camera live-view streaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 15</xref>), and the Snap button takes a single frame snapshot.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Live-view and RGB viewing mode</title><p id="P40">The camera image is streamed in the live-view mode, allowing the user to position the sample and to search for a suitable region of interest, as well as to determine appropriate imaging conditions, such as laser power and exposure time. The contrast and colormap settings of the streamed image are set by the user (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S46</xref>). The K2 software also features a RGB viewing mode, that superpositions the triple-color separated camera channels as a red-green-blue overlay in the live-view (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S47</xref>). This allows to quickly assess colocalization in different channels and therefore speeds up screening for an interesting cell or region of interest on the sample, and is a convenient tool during the alignment of the triple-color image splitter (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Sample stage</title><p id="P41">The piezo stick-slip stage is steered both with the software (either by clicking on the sample stage panel arrows, or using arrow keys on the keyboard) and by a handheld joystick controller.

It works by moving the sample upwards away from the objective, with <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> positions unchanged. The sample is first moved slowly (at 0.8 mm s<sup>-1</sup> for 3 mm), to avoid introducing air bubbles into the immersion oil and to give the fluid time to draw back to the objective (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure SM2</xref>). The sample can then be exchanged or moved horizontally, and returns to the previous <italic>z</italic>-position, again approaching the last millimeters towards the objective slowly. This considerably improves the handling when several samples are imaged and need to be exchanged often. When using multi-well samples, or when imaging many different regions on a single sample, the <italic>z</italic>-position toggle is used for removing the sample from the immersion oil, repositioning in <italic>x-y</italic>, and moving it back to the original <italic>z</italic>-position (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure SM3</xref>). This reduces the amount of immersion oil that has to be reapplied and thus allows for high-throughput measurements with minimal user interaction.

The transition from epifluorescence to TIRF imaging is easy to recognize (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] for a detailed description), as interference patterns caused by specs of dust scattering the coherent excitation laser beam, become visible. In sparse single-molecule type of samples, these interference patterns are not visible, but the transition is marked by a sharp increase in the signal-to-background ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. HILO imaging, where the laser beam penetrates the sample at an angle instead of being totally internally reflected, is typically performed close to the TIR setting (<italic>i.e</italic>. between 4mm to 5mm from the epifluorescence position).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Pre-configuring experiments</title><p id="P49">Imaging conditions and sequences may be pre-configured as saveable experiment configuration file (<italic>*.k2m</italic>) and can be reused as templates.

This can be done by performing a Sequence Acquisition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S55</xref>). Any excitation sequence, with one or several lasers excited during a given camera frame, can be pre-programmed, and is looped through for every timepoint throughout the duration of the experiment. The interval between each timepoint can be set, which also allows for timelapse recordings (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S56</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Video acquisition</title><p id="P53">The video acquisition mode allows the simultaneous imaging of multiple color channels, <italic>e.g</italic>. for multi-color single-molecule tracking experiments, at the maximum camera framerate without intervals between acquired frames. For every frame, the same pre-defined set of lasers at a certain power percentage will be used to excite the sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S57</xref>). Additionally, there is the option to use in-frame alternating laser excitation. For simultaneous imaging of blue excitable dyes (<italic>e.g</italic>. ATTO488) and cyanine dyes (<italic>e.g</italic>. ATTO643), this was demonstrated to decrease the bleaching of red dyes induced by the 488 nm laser drastically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The duration of the pulses is set to be at least ten times smaller than the total frame exposure time, and the triggering scheme is such that the 488 nm laser is pulsing anti-cyclic with respect to the others (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S58</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>zStack</title><p id="P54">Although TIRF microscopy implies collecting fluorescence from the sample surface plane, most TIRF setups allow changing the angle of incidence to HILO or epifluorescence imaging.

A FRAP experiment in the K2 setup is performed by collecting a number of pre-bleaching frames (either in Sequence- or Video-mode), followed by a bleaching phase where the flip-in lens is flipped into the excitation path, the power of one or several lasers is increased. After the bleaching phase, the recovery is recorded using the Sequence- or Video-mode (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure SM4</xref>). Between bleaching and the recovery phase, a short delay is introduced to account for the finite flipping time of the flip-in lens (flip-in: 0.5 s, flip-out: 1 s). The area and the position of the bleached spot is determined by the positioning and focal length of the flip-in lens.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Multiposition acquisition</title><p id="P56">Coordinates (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic>) of stage positions can be generated (<italic>e.g</italic>. fora raster scanning of the sample, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S52</xref>), saved in a list and called manually, or automated during an experiment where a pre-designed (sequence, video, and/or FRAP) acquisition is performed at each position of the coordinate list (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure SM3</xref>).

Make sure that the flip-in lens is flipped out, the TIR stage is in a safe position, the objective correction collar is in the correct position, and that the objective was cleaned properly by the last user. If heating is required, make sure to turn it on about 30 min before the experiment, to allow the temperature to stabilize (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p id="P58">Switch on the required power supplies (lasers, camera, camera cooling, motorized stages and mounts, computer) and mount the sample.

Bring the sample into focus using the sample stage joystick controller. As described before, during the initial operation, the qgFocus control loop settings and the TIR stage positions for epifluorescence, HILO and TIRF imaging should be determined to ensure optimal imaging performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Validation and characterization</title><sec id="S30"><title>Multicolor channel alignment</title><p id="P59">Chromatic dispersion and misalignment of optical elements in the detection pathway lead to distortions across the different color channels, complicating the analysis and interpretation of multicolor microscopy data. Especially for (single-molecule) colocalization experiments, different color channels need to be precisely co-aligned. The physical alignment of the color-splitting optical path is done while imaging a calibration slide and superimposing the three color channels, as described in the supplementary build instructions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S26</xref>). In doing so, we achieve an average spatial variation across different color channels below 1 μm. The remaining spatial offset between the channels is then corrected computationally: first, accumulated bead positions from raster scanning the calibration slide are assigned throughout the corresponding channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11a-b</xref>). A spatial correction map is then calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11c</xref>) using a recently introduced method based on Zernike polynomial gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Using this correction map, mean residual spatial variations are below 30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11c-d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Sample drift and focus stabilization</title><p id="P60">Minimizing sample drift is crucial in (TIRF) microscopy to ensure optimal signal-to-background ratios and the reproducibility of measurements. Therefore, we evaluated the axial and lateral drift of our K2 TIRF microscope, with and without the qgFocus focus stabilization, during a three hour experiment. Fluorescent beads (TetraSpeck Microspheres, 0.2 μm) mounted on the surface of a microscope slide were used as fiducials. The axial drift during experiments without focus lock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12a</xref>) is observable as a slight blurring of the beads, which is not the case for experiments with enabled focus lock. The axial sample drift was quantified by converting the lateral displacement of the back-reflected laser on the sensor into an axial distance. The displacement-to-pixel was determined in an initial calibration experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S51</xref>, 1px <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> 561 nm). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12b</xref> shows the axial drift throughout the three hour experiment exceeded 400 nm without focus lock, whereas virtually no residual drift was detectable when the focus lock was enabled (&lt; 10nm). Lateral drift was quantified by tracking the fiducial beads and calculating their euclidean distance from their original position at the start of the experiment. We found the lateral drift to be similar with and without focus lock enabled, which is expected since the focus lock only compensates the axial drift. In comparison to other setups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], the lateral drift is extremely low (≈ 200 nm in three hours), which is likely due to using a closed-loop piezo stage not only for the <italic>z</italic>-axis, but also for <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>j</italic>&gt;-axes. Most commercial and home-built setups use servomotors for the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>j</italic>&gt;-axes, with at least one order of magnitude worse resolution and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Large field-of-view and illumination homogeneity</title><p id="P61">One of the key features of the K2 TIRF microscope is its large field-of-view that is flat and homogeneously illuminated, which facilitates conducting statistically sound and quantitative single-molecule fluorescence experiments. Using a refractive beamshaper and appropriate optics, we are able to evenly illuminate a large field of view up to 190 μm in diameter, providing a high signal-to-background ratio across the entire field of view. This is especially important for dynamic live-cell or single-molecule tracking experiments (<italic>e.g</italic>. cellular activation essays, kinetic studies of molecular interactions), because events may be non-recurrent and capturing as much data from a single field of view as possible with little to no spatial variation in imaging quality is essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13c</xref>).</p><p id="P62">In addition, the large 2048x2048 px camera chip allows the imaging up to three color channels simultaneously side-by-side without the need to invest in multiple, synchronized cameras. Simultaneous capture of multi-color emission is important for accurately tracking fast dynamic processes of multiple species of fluorescently labeled molecules in cellular and artificial environments. For triple-color simultaneous imaging, the camera is cropped to produce three equal-sized fields of view of 682x682 pixels, or 73.656 μm x 73.656 μm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13</xref>).</p><p id="P63">Furthermore, the homogeneous illumination of the field of view of the K2 microscope not only provides a high signal-to-background ratio across the entire field of view, but also enables seamless stitching of images acquired by raster-scanning the sample. This is because the lack of vignetting at the edges of the field of view allows the individual images to be easily combined into a single, large image without loss of quality (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S54</xref>). Furthermore, the focus stabilization system is able to compensate for coverslip tilt and inhomogeneities that can degrade the image quality during rasterscanning. This allows us to perform fully automated raster-scanned image acquisitions, without the need for manual intervention to maintain focus (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure SM3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Objective heating stability and response time</title><p id="P64">We use an objective heater to maintain a stable, physiological temperature of the sample during extended live-cell imaging at 37 °C. The heater is controlled by a feedback loop that uses a temperature sensor at the objective to control the flow of current through a polyimide heater wrapped around the objective. Thermal decoupling of the objective and a plexiglass enclosure around the central cube help to maintain a constant temperature. The offset of objective temperature and the temperature directly at the sample was determined using a second sensor immersed in a test sample. At a room temperature of around 21 °C, the system stabilizes at an objective temperature of 42 °C (corresponding to 37 °C at the sample) after about 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figure 14</xref>). Since there is no active cooling, it takes about 200 min for the system to return to room temperature. The thermal isolation and the mass of the central cube ensure minimal heating of the rest of the setup, which is important for maintaining alignment. In fact, the environmental sensor on the central cube showed an increase in temperature of less than 1 °C when the objective was heated to 42 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S53</xref>). Overall, the objective heater is an effective and low-cost solution for maintaining a stable, physiological temperature of the sample during live-cell imaging.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Experimental applications: from live-cell imaging to single-molecule tracking</title><p id="P65">The K2 TIRF microscope can be used for a wide range of live-cell and single-molecule experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 15</xref> showcases several such applications: dual-color single-molecule tracking of membrane proteins on live cells, with the third channel being used for detecting a transfection reporter (1) and dual-color single-molecule tracking of reconstituted membrane proteins transiently forming dimers on a supported lipid bilayer (2), as well as timelapse imaging of immune cell activation (3). Epifluorescence imaging of giant unilamellar vesicles is shown in (4), alongside bright-field imaging of an immune cell using the circular LED array. Combining epifluorescence imaging together with the <italic>z</italic>-stack function allows to capture 3D volumes of cells in suspension (5). The K2 TIRF microscope is also capable of performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, here shown on a COS7 cell labeled with a fluorescent membrane marker (6).</p><p id="P66">In summary, the K2 TIRF microscope is a versatile instrument that allows the study of cellular and molecular dynamics in up to three fluorescence channels with an additional brightfield option. A large and homogeneously illuminated field-of-view and the highly-automated sample positioning and raster-scanning options enable the acquisition of high-quality microscopy data with comparatively high throughput and little demand on user input. Furthermore, imaging experiments can be performed for extended durations (hours) due to the setup’s excellent stability, active focus stabilization and objective heating for live-cell compatibility. The extensive open-source documentation should allow researchers to easily recreate the setup, or parts of it, and adapt it to their specific requirements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Video 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supplemental_Video_1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" id="d12aAdHbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Video 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supplemental_Video_2.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d12aAdHcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Video 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supplemental_Video_3.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d12aAdHdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Video 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supplemental_Video_4.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d12aAdHeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Video 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supplemental_Video_5.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d12aAdHfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS158945-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d12aAdHgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S35"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We acknowledge support from AMOLF mechanical, software and electronical engineering departments, as well as from the precision manufacturing department.

The angle of incidence is controlled using a motorized stage to switch between epifluorescence, HILO- and TIRF-imaging. A flip-in lens can be used to focus the beam at the sample plane for bleaching experiments. III) The detection pathway features a triple-color image splitter, projecting the field-of-view onto different regions of the sCMOS camera chip for simultaneous triple-color imaging. Two mirrors on magnetic mounts can be used to bypass the triple-color image splitter.
