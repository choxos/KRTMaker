Here, we examined longitudinal transcriptional and epigenetic changes in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a genetic condition characterised by persistent bacterial lung infections that drive progressive inflammatory lung damage. We find that sudden clinical deteriorations in lung health, termed Acute Pulmonary Exacerbations (APEs), are linked to innate immune signalling driven by bacterial components, and accompanied by changes in macrophage function. Treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics results in rapid modification of myeloid cell gene expression and epigenetic state, towards that of healthy volunteers, suggesting that repeated acute inflammatory episodes play an important role in CF inflammatory lung damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease associated with dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Impaired mucociliary clearance leads to the colonisation of the lungs by bacterial pathogens, and a pattern of inflammation and infection is established. Cytotoxic products released by neutrophils to kill bacteria damage tissues and are associated with lung function decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Inflammation in CF has generally been regarded as chronic and continuous in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, there is also clinical evidence that cyclical processes are involved. CF patients frequently undergo episodes of rapid clinical deterioration (APEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) that require prolonged (usually 14 days) treatment with intravenous antibiotics. It is not clear to what extent inflammation during such periods diverges from the baseline observed when the patient is clinically stable. CF therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand the temporal dynamics of inflammation in humans in the context of long-term bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P4">We collected whole blood samples from adult CF patients (<italic>n</italic> = 13) infected with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PsA) at 3 timepoints: at an APE onset, at the end of intravenous antibiotic treatment, and when returned to stable clinical baseline (at least 30 days after the APE onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <bold>Dataset 01</bold>). Analyses were performed on peripheral blood myeloid cells, due to the technical difficulty in isolating lung myeloid cells. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was associated with resolution of systemic inflammation and an improvement in lung function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The study group was broadly representative of the clinical characteristics of the entire cohort attending the adult CF centre from which they were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Gene expression of peripheral neutrophils and monocytes isolated from CF patients on each sampling day was directly compared with samples from age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV; <italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We observed a marked decrease in differential gene expression between CF and HV across the time series, with more differentially expressed (DE) genes at the onset of exacerbation (day 0), than on subsequent sampling days (days 14 and 30+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>; Datasets 02 &amp; 03). The median expression level of DE genes across patients was responsive to antibiotic treatment, indicating that the effect was distributed across individuals and was not driven by subset of the study patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Given the clear temporal dynamics of DE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>), we used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to identify 7 gene clusters in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Clusters of upregulated genes in CF were enriched for processes involved in innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), while downregulated clusters showed no immune-specific enrichment.</p><p id="P7">We also found differences in the functional properties of monocyte-derived macrophages between day 0, day 14, and day 30+, with decreased intracellular killing and greater inflammatory cytokine production observed in Day 14 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next assessed changes at the epigenetic level, in both cell types, through genome-wide profiling of H3K27ac by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq). Differentially acetylated regions (DAR) were identified for each time point by direct comparison with HV samples (<bold>Datasets 04 &amp; 05</bold>). Again, fewest DAR were identified in both neutrophils and monocytes at Day 14, indicating that IV treatment causes a reduction of the effects observed at day 0.</p><p id="P9">Two genes (<italic>TLR5</italic> and <italic>MAP3K20</italic>) had coordinate changes in transcription and H3K27ac at all time points in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; Dataset 06), while no genes had coordinate changes in monocytes (<bold>Dataset 07</bold>). In total, four DARs were assigned to <italic>TLR5</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, Materials and Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), spanning the promoter region and a distal site located 57 kb upstream that has not previously been associated with <italic>TLR5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We integrated all data layers for neutrophils and monocytes using a multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and identified eight latent factors accounting for 30-60% of the variance across data types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Several clinical variables were significantly correlated with latent MOFA factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), indicating that phenotypic variation among CF patients is reflected at gene expression level and in the epigenetics of innate immune cells.</p><p id="P11">As all patients in this study were infected with PsA, we sought to assess the extent to which direct detection of PsA by myeloid cells was responsible for the observed changes. Neutrophils from three healthy volunteers were exposed to PsA or purified PsA flagellin (a known ligand for TLR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>)) and their transcriptional response was determined using RNA-seq.</p><p id="P12">As expected, the majority (86%) of the genes responsive to flagellin were also differentially expressed in PsA-exposed cells (<italic>P</italic> = 8.5 × 10<sup>-207</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). PsA-upregulated genes overlapped with genes overexpressed significantly in CF neutrophils at day 0 (86 genes, <italic>P</italic> = 5.0 × 10<sup>-13</sup>) and at day 30+ (7 genes, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01), but not at day 14 (2 genes, <italic>P</italic> = 0.31; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <bold>Dataset 08</bold>).</p><p id="P13">Genes upregulated in PsA-exposed neutrophils and CF patient neutrophils formed a highly connected functional network (STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) protein-protein interaction enrichment <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-16</sup>). The largest connected component of this network included a subset of genes directly responsive to flagellin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), implicating this bacterial product as an important inflammatory driver. Moreover, 23 of the 88 proteins encoded by the genes in the network are responsive to one or more approved drugs (<bold>Dataset 09</bold>) and a further 6 to therapeutic compounds not yet approved (<bold>Dataset 09</bold>).</p><p id="P14">In summary, we have shown that the epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional properties of CF patient myeloid cells fluctuate temporally during the infection cycle. Additional work is required to determine whether or not the inflammatory program changes between periods of disease exacerbation. Peripheral myeloid cells have a short half-life, and the lack of persistence of epigenetic changes between sampling dates indicates that the bone marrow progenitors of these cells are not permanently modified during the infection cycle. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that antibiotic treatment directly modulates gene expression in these cells, the reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes persists between Days 14 and 30+, indicating that it is more probably an indirect result of the effect of reducing bacterial burden in the lung.</p><p id="P15">We observed increased TNF production and decreased bacterial killing from macrophages isolated at Day 14 relative to the other sampling days. This may indicate that macrophages at Day 14 are sensitised to the presence of bacteria, due to the reduction in the infection burden caused by the administration of intravenous antibiotics. However, further work is necessary to establish the exact basis of such fluctuations. We also defined a functionally connected network of genes, which is directly responsive to PsA exposure. Targeting this network could therefore offer a rational strategy for reducing inflammation-associated pathology in CF.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P16">Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were enrolled from Royal Papworth Hospital, UK, after written informed consent (ethical approval REC 19/EE/0241).
