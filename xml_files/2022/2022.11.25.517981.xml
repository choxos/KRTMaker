Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30,000 UK Biobank participants we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal-striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF∼WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF∼WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched forG-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein (CRP), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (<italic>r<sub>g</sub></italic> = 0.026, <italic>P</italic> = 0.36) and ICVF (<italic>r<sub>g</sub></italic> = 0.112, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (p&lt;0.05). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NODDI</kwd><kwd>BMI</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>WHR</kwd><kwd>UK Biobank</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Obesity has long been recognised as a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes. More recently, it has also emerged as an important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, linked to both an increased risk of dementia and accelerated age-associated cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sellbom and Gunstad, 2012</xref>). Defined as the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">González-Muniesa et al., 2017</xref>), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last thirty years, making it one of the most important global public health challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yatsuya et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To date, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Results in this field were often contradictory: although studies tended to report lower gray matter volume in relation to obesity, some have also observed null or positive associations as described in a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">García-García et al.(2019)</xref>, who noted that the likely reasons for this were heterogeneities in brain and obesity metrics, a wide variation in sample size, and poor statistical methodology.</p><p id="P5">However, the emerging consensus indicates that typically studies are reporting negative associations between obesity (particularly visceral obesity indexed by waist to hip ratio: WHR) and (smaller) total grey matter volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cox et al., 2019</xref>) and (thinner) cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Caunca et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, this negative association between body mass index (BMI) and global grey matter volume has been substantiated in a recent large-scale study conducted in the UK Biobank involving 9,652 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hamer and Batty, 2019</xref>). Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies, including data from 5,882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6,420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group, have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">García-García et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Opel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">These associations between obesity and macroscopic features of grey matter structure have also been supported by longitudinal studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Franz et al.</xref> showed that by the age of 64 years, participants whose BMI steadily increased over forty years had thinner cortex in several frontal and temporal brain regions compared to those whose BMI was stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Franz et al., 2019</xref>). Other longitudinal studies have shown associations between age-associated increases in BMI and grey matter reductions in the medial temporal lobe (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) and cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Arnoldussen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bobb et al., 2014</xref>). Together with the finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Opel et al.,2020</xref>) of a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness driven by lower thickness in older participants, this suggests that the negative impact of obesity on the brain accumulates over time.</p><p id="P7">Together, these studies provide robust evidence for an association between obesity and macrostructural features of brain anatomy such as grey matter volume and cortical thickness. However, changes in grey matter volume and cortical thickness can be driven by multiple different underlying processes and our understanding of the microstructural features that underpin this relationship remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Westwater et al., 2022</xref>). For example, it is currently not known whether obesity-associated differences in grey matter volume relate to changes in the size, shape or number of neurons e.g. neurite density or orientation dispersion within that region or alternately to differences in tissue water content. To date, the only studies to have investigated associations of obesity with brain microstructure have focused on white matter. Interestingly, these have identified obesity-associated differences in a number of different microstructural features of white matter including 1) obesity-related increases in white matter water content, 2) reduced myelination and 3) lower fractional anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kullmann et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether comparable differences in cortical and subcortical grey matter micro-structure can be observed with obesity are yet to be reported.</p><p id="P8">We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures (bilaterally) produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) modelling of data from ∼30,000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort. Unlike conventional diffusion MRI which models data acquired at a single diffusion weighting (shell), NODDI requires data collected at multiple different diffusion weightings (shells) then exploits the diffusion characteristics that can be observed in different tissue compartments to quantify their respective volume fractions. In this model, diffusion is modelled as isotropic in free water, restricted within neurites, and hindered in the extracellular space resulting in three microstructural metrics: Intracellular Volume Fraction (ICVF) which captures the volume fraction occupied by neurites (axons and dendrites) but not cell bodies, Orientation Dispersion Index (OD) which captures the spatial distribution of these processes and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) which provides a measure of free water index).</p><p id="P9">Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity, we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI. Specifically, we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity, using prior maps of gene expression, cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system.</p><p id="P10">Finally, we then completed two further analyses to explore the potential directionality of the relationship between obesity and brain microstructure. In the first, we we used genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) for brain ISOVF and ICVF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Warrier et al., 2022</xref>), and for WHR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">(Pulitet al., 2019)</xref>, to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. In the second, we produced brain maps for the association of ISOVF and ICVF with C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of systemic inflammation. Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose (particularly visceral adipose) tissue we predicted tighter correlations between maps of CRP and ISOVF than maps of CRP with ICVF.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sample data</title><p id="P11">We used data provided by the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of &gt;500,000 subjects aged between 39 and 73 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>) and focused on a subset of participants for whom complete multi-modal MRI data were available.

WHR and BMI were strongly positively correlated with each other (<italic>r</italic> = 0.428 ± 0.009, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) and we therefore focus here on WHR although similar results are reported for BMI in Supplemental Information (see comparisons in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure S2–S3</xref>and<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4–S5</xref>as well as<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Of the MRI metrics, there was one macro-structural measure (GM, grey matter volume) and 5 micro-structural measures (MD, mean diffusivity; FA, fractional anisotropy; OD, orientation dispersion; ICVF, intra-cellular volume fraction; and ISOVF, isotropic volume fraction). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, some of these metrics were strongly correlated, indicating that they represented similar aspects of the underlying cortical micro-structure or tissue composition. For example, FA, OD and ICVF metrics of neurite density were more strongly correlated with each other than with ISOVF, which is typically interpreted as a marker of tissue free water rather than cytoarchitectonics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamiya et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To address this potential redundancy, we performed a preliminary correlational analysis of all 6 MRI metrics with WHR then focused our subsequent analyses on ICVF and ISOVF, the two complementary MRI metrics that were most strongly associated with WHR.

Referencing a database of prior task-related fMRI studies, this anatomical pattern of fMRI activations has been activated by tasks involving reward, auditory and musical functions (see SI <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3 b-c</xref>).

To do this we independently tested 13,561 gene transcripts for significant spatial correlation with each map, i.e., ISOVF∼WHR or ICVF∼WHR, controlling for multiple comparisons entailed by whole genome analysis with FDR = 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

The most under-represented process was “response to interleukin-6” and the most enriched process was “pattern recognition receptor activity”, both processes linked to the innate immune system.

The most negatively enriched process was “peptidyl-asparagine modification” and the most positively enriched process was “taste receptor activity”.

On this basis we tested the hypothesis that genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) for normal variation in ISOVF or ICVF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Warrier et al., 2022</xref>) were correlated with prior GWAS results for obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Pulit et al., 2019</xref>), indexed by WHR (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Shungin et al., 2015</xref>). We used linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) analysis to estimate genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF or ICVF.

Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose (particularly visceral adipose) tissue, for CRP we expected tighter correlations between ISOVF maps than ICVF maps.

Here, using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30,000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity (WHR) and two measures of grey matter microstucture, ISOVF (an index of tissue water content) and ICVF an index of neurite density (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for a summary).</p><p id="P30">Similar to previously reported associations with brain grey matter macrostructure, positive scaling of WHR and tissue water content (i.e. oedema) was most pronounced within frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical structures. In contrast, we observed a more anterior-posterior pattern of association between WHR and neurite density, with more obese individuals having higher neurite density in posterior compared to anterior brain regions. By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives, and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses. Interestingly, these regions were also richer in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells but not any class of neurons; and had high concentrations of some but not all neurotransmitter receptors or transporters tested, e.g., histamine (H3), mu-opioid, D1 and 5HTT.</p><p id="P31">In contrast the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where obesity was associated with increased neurite density was co-located with expression of transcripts positively enriched for taste receptor activity and lower fatty acid binding, glutamate receptor activity and other biological processes linked to protein kinase C-activating G protein coupled receptor signalling. Interestingly, this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3, Mu, CB1 and A4B2, meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding, appetite, and energy expenditure.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>What are the potential causal relationships between obesity and brain MRI phenotypes?</title><p id="P32">ISOVF and ICVF are weakly correlated (i.e. independent) markers of free water and neurite density, respectively.

This raises the question: Could these two brain phenotypes have a different causal relationship with obesity?</p><p id="P33">For example, it is conceivable that the changes in brain water associated with obesity could represent an effect of obesity on the brain, i.e., WHR™ISOVF, whereas the obesity-related changes in neurite density could represent an effect of the brain on obesity, i.e., ICVF™WHR. Such a bidirectional mechanistic model of the relationships between obesity and the brain seems somewhat plausible. Obesity is usually caused by changes in eating behaviour and physical activity, which are controlled by brain systems enriched for opioid, dopamine and cannabinoid receptor-mediated signalling. So changes in the brain, indexed by neurite density, could conceivably cause adipogenic eating behaviours and thus obesity. Obesity in turn causes a pro-inflammatory state systemically and blood concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and other cytokines have previously been associated with changed (increased) micro-structural MRI metrics of free water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kitzbichler et al., 2021</xref>). So inflammation could potentially mediate effects of obesity on the brain tissue water content (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Turkheimer et al., 2022</xref>). Our finding that the CRP-WHR map correlation is significantly stronger for the ISOVF maps than the ICVF maps would be consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p id="P34">Using novel techniques for analysis of spatial co-location of whole genome transcript maps and MRI phenotypes to optimise subsequent enrichment analysis of strongly co-located gene transcripts, we found that transcripts co-located with ISOVF∼WHR were enriched for IL6 and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), both implicated in innate immune signalling; whereas transcripts co-located with ICVF∼WHR were enriched for taste receptors. This pattern of results is consistent with the model that changes in neurite density associated with obesity might reflect primary brain changes in taste sensation and reward processing that drive consummatory behaviours leading to obesity; whereas changes in brain free water associated with obesity might reflect effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue that drive extravasation and oedema in some brain regions.</p><p id="P35">One limitation of this study is that data was collected at multiple centres and even though we used site as a nuisance regressor there might be unaccounted for non-linear effects. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Duffet al.(2022)</xref> showed that quantities derived from UK Biobank scans at different sites are reliable.</p><p id="P36">It should also be mentioned that the age range of the AHBA donors (24-57 years) is only partially overlapping with the participants in the UK Biobank (44-80 years). Future studies will hopefully provide a more comprehensive picture of whole brain gene expression as a function of age so that the powerful strategy for linking transcriptional and imaging data that the AHBA dataset has enabled can be extended to gene expression datasets more closely aligned demographically with the neuroimaging dataset of interest. These and other methodological issues relating to alignment of AHBA gene expression data with MRI phenotypes have been rigorously reviewed in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">(Fornitoet al., 2019;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arnatkeviciute et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Concerning the question whether both brain systems are in operation in the same individual at the same time, we are not aware of any currently available tools that would allow us to actually test this assumption, but it could be an interesting avenue for future work. Another limitation of our study is that it is based on a cross-sectional dataset, and it is therefore impossible to disentangle causally directed relationships with certainty from correlations between MRI and transcriptional phenotypes. We also approached this question by using GWAS data on obesity and each of the two MRI metrics to estimate and test genetic correlations between obesity and ISOVF or ICVF. We found that ICVF was genetically correlated with obesity, but not ISOVF. This result is consistent with the bidirectional mechanistic model, whereby changes in neurite density (but not brain water) cause obesity, but it doesn’t prove it. There are many other possible interpretations of a genetic correlation between phenotypes, i.e., pleiotropic genetic effects on both phenotypes, which do not entail a causal relationship between phenotypes. Further work will be needed to validate this and other causal models of the directional relationships between obesity and the brain, which could be important for future prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S13"><title>Data available in UK Biobank</title><sec id="S14" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P38">Data were provided by the UK Biobank (application IDs 20904 &amp; 48943), a population-based cohort of &gt;500,000 subjects aged between 39 and 73 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>).
