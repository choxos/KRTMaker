Reducing the rate and extent of starch digestibility in wheat-based foods can help to maintain healthy blood glucose levels, which is important for the prevention and management of obesity and chronic diseases like type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blaak et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that consumption of resistant starch, that is the starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon, can reduce blood glucose levels and help to maintain a healthy gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Corrado et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Belobrajdic et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, breeding for wheat with less digestible starch is an important strategy to develop healthier staple foods.</p><p id="P3">A mature wheat grain is predominately starch, 60-70% (w/w), which is the greatest contributor to calories, 10-15% (w/w) protein and 11-15% (w/w) dietary fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shewry et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Delcour and Hoseney, 2010</xref>). Starch is produced in the endosperm of wheat during grain filling and is composed of two distinct α-glucan polymers, amylose (linear α-1,4-linked chains) and amylopectin (α-1,4-linked chains with α-1,6-linked branches). In their native state, starch polymers exist as partially crystalline granules, which are difficult for humans to digest; thus starch-based foods are typically cooked prior to consumption. Heating starch in the presence of water leads to starch gelatinization making starch polymers more digestible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wang and Copeland, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chung et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Parada and Aguilera, 2009</xref>). Subsequent cooling leads to retrogradation in which starch polymers form crystalline structures that are less digestible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corrado et al., 2020</xref>). Other intrinsic properties of starch, like its molecular structure can also influence starch digestibility, including the length of its glucan chains and amylose-to-amylopectin ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hazard et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schönhofen et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anugerah et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To date, reverse genetic studies in wheat have demonstrated potential for increasing resistant starch levels using induced mutations in starch biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Botticella et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schonhofen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hazard et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fahy et al., 2022</xref>). However, initial analyses of some mutants have shown detrimental effects on yield and on pasta and bread-making quality, thus identifying additional sources of genetic variation for starch digestibility could support the development of improved traits for commercial breeding applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schonhofen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hazard et al., 2015</xref>). Wheat landraces, locally adapted lines that have not been modified through modern breeding techniques, present reservoirs of genetic diversity that can be introduced into modern cultivars. Of special note is the A.E. Watkins bread wheat landrace collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wingen et al., 2014</xref>) encompassing 826 bread wheat landraces collected in the 1920s and 1930s from a wide geographic distribution. This collection contains useful variation for a number of agronomic traits and has been used to identify resistance genes for a variety of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dyck and Jedel, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bansal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bansal et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burt et al., 2014</xref>). The Watkins lines have been purified by single-seed descent from which many genomic and genetic resources have been developed; a core set of 118 accessions was used to generate nested association mapping populations, all of which were genotyped, have genetic maps available, and are free to access (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wisplandracepillar.jic.ac.uk/">http://wisplandracepillar.jic.ac.uk/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wingen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Despite the availability of diverse wheat germplasm resources like the Watkins collection, forward screening approaches for starch digestibility have been limited due to the lack of informative, accurate, and efficient phenotyping methods. Screening based on amylose content, which has a positive association with resistant starch content, can identify lines with high levels of resistant starch but cannot identify factors beyond amylose content that may cause resistance to digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>). Only a few studies have developed methods to screen large populations for starch digestibility and they have focused on analyzing purified starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, other components of the wheat flour matrix and processing (e.g. starch retrogradation) could potentially impact starch digestibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sissons et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). To our knowledge no previous studies have screened flour samples of germplasm collections.</p><p id="P6">Recently, a new <italic>in vitro</italic> method for measuring starch digestibility was published which produces results that are well correlated with the glycaemic response to foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This method has proven useful for measuring starch digestibility in mechanistic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>) and testing early-stage food products. However, modifications were made to tailor the method for screening large wheat germplasm collections accurately and efficiently. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput starch digestibility assay based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al. (2019)</xref> protocol, which utilizes a 96-sample format for simultaneous analysis over a 90 min starch digestion. Using standard samples of wheat and maize starch, we validated the assay by comparing starch digestibility profiles to those produced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al. (2019)</xref> protocol. The high-throughput assay was then used to screen processed flour samples of the core Watkins (c.Watkins) collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wingen et al., 2014</xref>) and commercial wheat lines (for bread, biscuit, and animal feed) which revealed natural phenotypic variation for starch digestibility.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P7">Chemicals used in this study: Percoll™ (17-0891-01, GE Healthcare), 4-Hydroxybenzhydrazide (PAHBAH) (5351-23-5), TRIS (77-86-1), EDTA (60-00-4), SDS (151-21-3), DTT (3483-12-3), Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (P4417-100), Sodium Carbonate (497-19-8), DMSO (67-68-5), maltose (6363-53-7), sodium hydroxide (1310-73-2) and α-amylase (DFP Treated, Type I-A, saline suspension, 647-015-00-4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Poole, UK.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>High-throughput starch digestibility assay</title><p id="P8">Starch digestion assays were carried out on samples that were gelatinized and cooled to accelerate retrogradation following a protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al.

Phosphate buffered saline (600 μL, PBS, pH 7.4) was added to each sample with a 1 mm glass ball to improve mixing. The deep well plate was sealed and secured with a Cap-mat (96-well, 7 mm, Round Plug, Silicone/PTFE) and added to a preheated thermal mixer (80°C) with a 96 SmartBlock™ DWP 1000n attachment (Thermomixer C, Eppendorf Ltd., Stevenage, UK ) for 15 min at 1500 rpm to gelatinize the starch, then cooled at 4°C for 21 h to accelerate retrogradation. The plate was then briefly spun (100g for 1 min) to collect condensed liquid on the Cap-mat and placed on the thermal mixer for 30 min at 37°C, 1600 rpm. Time zero samples (50 μL) were collected using a 12-multichannel pipette and transferred into a 2 mL deep well plate containing 1.95 mL of stop solution (17 mM NaCO3). Digestion was started by adding pancreatic α-amylase suspended in PBS targeting 2U/mL activity into the samples. Enzyme activity was determined by applying the starch digestibility assay on gelatinized potato starch and obtaining the linear rate of maltose release every 3 minutes (mg/mL). Aliquots (50 μL) were then taken after 6, 12, 18, 24, 40, and 90 minutes from the onset of digestion and transferred to the stop solution.</p><p id="P9">The stopped reactions were then centrifuged at 1500g for 5 minutes to avoid transferring any starch remnants, and 50 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new deep well plate; 50 μL of maltose standards (5 - 1000 μM) were also added to the plate. The PAHBAH reducing end assay was used to quantify the reducing ends released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lever, 1972</xref>). Briefly, 0.5 mL of freshly prepared reagent (2 g of p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide dissolved in 38 mL of 0.5 M HCl and 360 mL of 0.5 M NaOH) was added to each sample. The deep-well plate was held at 100°C for 7 min and then placed in an ice bath for 10 min. Samples were then transferred to a microplate, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus, Waukegan, Illinois, USA). Reducing sugars were expressed as maltose equivalents, using a standard curve of maltose standards (5 - 1000 μM) from each sample plate. Starch digestibility (%) was expressed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al. (2019)</xref>; each timepoint's maltose equivalents were corrected by subtracting the baseline maltose (time zero) and then divided by the maltose equivalent of total starch.

(2019)</xref> protocol (referred to as ‘Edwards protocol’ throughout). The high-throughput assay (detailed in the methods section) was scaled from a 6-tube format to a 96-well plate format which required optimizations for maintaining even heat distribution during starch digestions and PAHBAH assays, for the mixing ability of samples, and for recovering adequate sample volumes for analysis. We also developed new tools to allow faster sample handling for sample preparation and pipetting (Plate Z, available free to download from hackster.io). Digestion profiles of maize and wheat starch standards were comparable to profiles generated using the Edwards protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), particularly with respect to the variance. For example, the difference in the average estimates at 90 mins from the two methods was -0.72 percentage points, and the variation observed at 90 min within the runs was 2.1 percentage points in the high-throughput assay and 2.2 percentage points in the Edwards protocol. There were no significant differences in the percent of starch digested at all the time points measured between the Edwards protocol and the high-throughput assay. Thus, the high-throughput assay provided comparisons between samples that were accurate and reproducible, and the reliability of the assay was deemed sufficient for use as a screening tool to aid in the selection of low- and high-digestibility samples. For future work, it will be important to consider improving the efficiency of upstream steps, including milling, sieving, and weighing samples which present additional bottlenecks.</p><p id="P20">Recent studies have reported improved methods to increase the throughput of starch digestibility assays. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang et al.

Other studies have also aimed to increase the throughput of starch characterization techniques however, the starch properties analyzed may or may not have a direct impact on starch digestibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kaufman et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Perez-Moral et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to consider that other components of wheat flour and factors like processing are likely to have a major impact on starch digestibility thus, determining starch digestibility on processed flour samples may better represent what people may consume in wheat-based foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Toutounji et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).

In this method, samples were handled individually with a single pipette, which was a limiting factor for the number of samples that could be processed simultaneously. Furthermore, the assay was performed using a set of 8 samples and this assay still needs to be validated on a larger sample set. The high-throughput assay described here addresses some of these key limitations presented by prior assays namely the type of sample analyzed (hydrothermally processed flour) and sample size (96-sample format).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Screening of c.Watkins landraces and elite varieties</title><sec id="S15"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> starch digestibility</title><p id="P21">Results of the high-throughput assay revealed a wide range of variation in starch digestibility among c.Watkins landraces; starch digestibility profiles formed a gradient of low to high digestibility rather than two distinct groups, which is expected from complex traits. This variation was evident at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For the c.Watkins lines, the levels of starch digested ranged between 9.7 - 31.6% (at 6 min), 13.2-35% (at 12 min), 14.8-37.2% (at 18 minutes), 16.2 - 36.1% (at 24 min), 19 - 37.8% (at 40 min), and 23.5 - 39.9% (at 90 min). The residual variance from the mixed effect model, measuring the variability between technical replicates from the same sample in the same run, was 3.7 percentage points. The variance using wholemeal flour was higher than the variance using starch standards in the validation experiment, and this could be due to the higher variability in wholemeal flour composition compared to purified starch samples. The number of technical replicates needed to estimate starch digestibility to a given precision can be calculated from residual variance.</p><p id="P22">There was no evidence for a relationship between the plot location in the field and the starch digestibility at 90 min, as no trend was observed between field rows and columns (Supplemental Figure 3). Elite UK varieties showed less variation and greater starch digestibility compared to most c.Watkins lines, although a direct comparison is confounded by the different growing conditions between the two groups. For example, the levels of starch digested for the elite varieties ranged between 26.8 – 36.4% (at 6 min), 29.4-40.4% (at 12 min), 30.6 – 43.8% (at 18 min), 30 – 43.4% (at 24 min), 31.3 – 43.4% (at 40 min) and 31.2 – 43.5% (at 90 min).</p><p id="P23">Our results demonstrate that natural phenotypic variation for starch digestibility exists in the c.Watkins collection (representing the genetic diversity of the entire Watkins collection, 826 lines) as well as in elite varieties representing commercial groups of bread, biscuit and animal feed groups, thus there is potential for identifying underlying genetic diversity. The levels of variation observed in the c.Watkins were greater than the elite varieties screened, which is consistent with the higher levels of genetic diversity previously reported for the c.Watkins collection compared to modern European bread wheat varieties, as well as increased phenotypic variation for agronomically desirable traits, such as stripe, leaf, and stem rust resistance, as well as grain surface area and grain width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wingen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bansal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bansal et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Randhawa et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Toor et al., 2013</xref>). It is important to note that a limitation of our study was that the grain samples of c.Watkins lines and elite varieties were not produced in the same field trial, and each used a plot per line, so it is possible that environmental conditions between and within fields could influence the average starch digestibility levels and the variation observed; this will be important to consider in future trials. Furthermore, with the availability of structured germplasm panels (nested association mapping populations) and genotype data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wingen et al., 2017</xref>), there is now potential for use of the high-throughput assay to investigate the genetic factors underlying the variation in starch digestibility observed through approaches like QTL analysis which will aid in identification of underlying candidate genes and development of tools for marker assisted-selection.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Total Starch</title><p id="P24">Total starch (TS) content of wholemeal flour varied significantly for c.Watkins landraces (43 ± 3.3 g/100 flour to 61 ± 2.4 g/100 flour, mean ± SE, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001), and the elite varieties (46 ± 3.6 g/100 flour to 61 ± 0.9 g/100 flour, mean ± SE, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (Supplemental data). The elite variety Diego had the highest TS content (61 ± 0.9 g/100 flour, mean ± SE), and the c.Watkins line 651 had the lowest (43 ± 3.3 g/100 flour, mean ± SE). Most of the samples had a TS content between 47 to 57 g/100 flour. Linear regression analysis showed that total starch content only weakly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0108) with starch digested at 90 min which suggests that the differences in total starch content cannot explain the variation observed for starch digestibility (Supplemental Figure 4).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Analysis of low- and high-digestibility lines as wholemeal flour, sieved flour, and purified starch</title><p id="P25">Three low-digestibility lines: 777 (WATDE0111), 216 (WATDE0025), and 639 (WATDE0083); and five high-digestibility lines: including two c.Watkins landraces 816 (WATDE0117), 308 (WATDE0042) and the three UK elite varieties Myriad, Dickens, and Paragon were selected for further analysis. The selection was based on the high-throughput starch digestibility assay results, specifically the ranking (low to high), to represent the variation observed in the screen.</p><p id="P26">Starch digestibility profiles differed considerably for wholemeal flour, sieved flour and purified starch, suggesting that other flour components besides starch likely contributed to the variation in starch digestibility observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). For wholemeal flour (&lt;0.3 mm), starch digestibility profiles of selected ‘low-’ and ‘high-digestibility’ lines grouped separately where the high-digestibility samples varied between 37.6 - 41.6% and low-digestibility samples varied between 23.5 - 24.3% (at 90 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). For sieved flour (&lt; 0.05 mm), the digestibility of two low-lines (216 and 639) increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared to wholemeal samples, and the third low-line (777) remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In sieved flour, the high-digestibility samples varied between 38.1 - 42.7%, whereas low-digestibility samples varied between 26 - 35.4% (at 90 min). Purified starch samples also showed a greater extent of starch digested at 90 minutes compared to wholemeal and sieved flour fractions (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) but there were no differences between the high- and low-digestibility groups in purified starch samples. For example, high-digestibility lines differed between 46.9 - 52.3% and low-digestibility lines varied between 47.6 - 49.2% (at 90 min); the variation observed at 90 min within the runs was 3 SD (95% CI= 2.3 to 4.2%).</p><p id="P27">The varying digestibility profiles observed across purification steps suggest that multiple mechanisms in the selected lines could be affecting starch digestibility and that different factors in each line could have a distinct effect. This is consistent with prior studies which have shown effects of flour characteristics and starch structure on starch digestibility in cooked wheat samples including particle size of wholemeal flour, protein content, and chain-length distribution of starch polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Obadi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sissons et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, selected lines were also analyzed for flour properties (flour particle size, endogenous α-amylase and protein content) and starch structural properties (starch granule size distribution and chain-length distribution), however, none of the factors strongly correlated with starch digestibility, which could be due to the high phenotypic variation of the Watkins collection (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figures 5,6,7). An important limitation of this aspect of the study was the small number of lines selected for this analysis; prior work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang et al. (2022)</xref> identified starch properties influencing starch digestibility in a screen of 224 wheat starches. Nevertheless, our study suggests that a combination and interaction of many factors are required to achieve low starch digestibility profiles in flour, so using a high-throughput starch digestibility assay for screening or selection approaches may be more efficient and informative than selection based solely on underlying factors such as starch molecular structure.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>c.Watkins</term><def><p id="P28">core Watkins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAHBAH</term><def><p id="P29">p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TS Total</term><def><p id="P30">starch</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by the UKRI Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Norwich Research Park Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership [grant number BB/M011216/1] (PZ) and the UKRI Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Institute Strategic Programme' Food Innovation and Health' (grant number BB/R012512/1) and its constituent projects BBS/E/F/000PR10343 (Theme 1, Food Innovation) and BBS/E/F/000PR10345 (Theme 2, Digestion in the Upper GI Tract) and the BBSRC Core Capability Grant BB/CCG1860/1 awarded to Quadram Institute Bioscience; the BBSRC Institute Strategic Programme Grants' Molecules from Nature' — Crop Quality BBS/E/J/000PR9799 awarded to the John Innes Centre and 'Designing Future Wheat' BB/P016855/1 awarded to the John Innes Centre.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P31"><bold>Authors contributions:</bold></p><p id="P32">Petros Zafeiriou: Conceptualization, investigation, methodology, project administration, data curation, and formal analysis, writing – original draft preparation, writing – review &amp; editing, George M.
