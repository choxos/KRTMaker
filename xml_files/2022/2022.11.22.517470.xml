While the function of these toxins has been studied in detail, the contribution of other factors, including the paracrystalline surface layer (S-layer), to disease is less well known. Here, we highlight the essentiality of the S-layer <italic>in vivo</italic> by reporting the recovery of S-layer revertants, following infection with the S-layer-null strain, FM2.5.

The virulence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> has widely been attributed to the production of two toxins; toxins A (TcdA, enterotoxin) and B (TcdB, cytotoxin), responsible for cytoskeletal modifications, epithelial damage, inflammation, and fluid loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Braun et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chandrasekaran and Lacy 2017</xref>). A third toxin, the binary <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin (CDT), expressed by only a subset of strains, has been linked to enhanced disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chandrasekaran and Lacy 2017</xref>). Consequently, <italic>C. difficile</italic> colitis has widely been considered as a toxin-mediated disease. However, the availability of tools to analyse gene expression and improved methods of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cartman et al. 2012a</xref>), together with the availability of an accessible murine animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al. 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Theriot et al. 2011</xref>), have offered new opportunities to identify other traits, both bacterial and host-associated, that impact disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McDermott et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fletcher et al. 2021</xref>). The recent use of such approaches has provided clearer understanding of the metabolic flexibility of these organisms, the role of the microbiome in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buffie et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fletcher et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Girinathan et al. 2021</xref>) and established several bacterial factors that influence the host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maldarelli et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Batah et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arato et al. 2019</xref>). Of particular interest in this context, is the role of the S-layer in disease. This paracrystalline protein array is the outermost layer of the <italic>C. difficile</italic> cell envelope, with similar structures found in many bacteria and virtually all archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fagan and Fairweather 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The S-layer has been shown to perform multiple and vital roles including providing protection from environmental factors such as variations in pH, mechanical and osmotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Engelhardt and Peters 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Claus et al. 2002</xref>; Engelhardt 2007). <italic>In vivo,</italic> it is proposed to play a role in molecular sieving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sleytr and Beveridge 1999</xref>) and ion trapping, protecting the organism from antimicrobial peptides and bacteriolytic enzymes produced in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lortal et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). The S-layer has also been shown to be a key target in bacteriophage predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Callegari et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>; Royer et al. 2022).</p><p id="P9">In <italic>C. difficile</italic>, the main component of the S-layer is SlpA, which is post-translationally cleaved by a cell wall protein (CWP), Cwp84, into two functional S-layer proteins (SLPs), SLP<sub>L</sub> and SLP<sub>H</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kirby et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fagan and Fairweather 2014</xref>). The proteinaceous array is further decorated by other CWPs, which provide additional functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fagan and Fairweather 2014</xref>). Assembly of the paracrystalline array relies on tiling of SLP<sub>H</sub> triangular prisms on the cell wall, interlocked by SLP<sub>L</sub> ridges facing the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>). Exposure of SLP<sub>L</sub> to the environment is consistent with its high sequence variability observed between different <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains, with 13 different S-layer cassette types (SLCTs) identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dingle et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). Strikingly, the lattice is very compact compared to other studied S-layers, which have pores of between 30 – 100 Å compared with only <sup>~</sup>10 Å in diameter in <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>). This tight packing correlates well with the hypothesis that S-layer acts as a molecular sieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sleytr and Beveridge 1999</xref>), as deletion of the most exposed regions of SLP<sub>L</sub> results in a strain with increased sensitive to lysozyme, in comparison to the parent strain, R20291 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In <italic>C. difficile</italic>, the S-layer has also been implicated in host cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Merrigan et al., 2013</xref>), biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kirby et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dapa et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Richards et al. 2018</xref>) and immunomodulation through cell signalling of the host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ausiello et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sakakibara et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sekot et al. 2011</xref>). SlpA has been shown to induce innate and adaptive immune responses through activation of TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). However, the role of the S-layer in <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis and in immune evasion remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P11">Previously, we reported the isolation and characterization of a spontaneous <italic>C. difficile</italic> strain lacking an S-layer, FM2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). In initial studies using the Golden Syrian hamster as the infection model, FM2.5 caused no symptoms of disease, despite effectively colonising infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). However, the acute sensitivity of hamsters to <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxins and lack of readily available immunological tools, limits their usefulness in studying the more nuanced facets of this infection. In contrast, mice are naturally less susceptible to CDI, requiring more extensive antibiotic treatment to suppress the flora, and higher challenge doses to achieve colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen et al. 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Winston et al. 2016</xref>). However, mice offer greater opportunities to determine the contributions of other virulence-associated traits on disease outcome, including long-term persistence associated with relapsing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Best et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Here, we sought to elucidate the role of the S-layer as a major virulence determinant in a murine model of infection, to determine whether the loss of virulence observed in the hamster model is reciprocal in other hosts.

Infection of antibiotic pre-treated mice with strain R20291 resulted in significant weight loss of up to 15%; peaking between 24 and 48 h post-infection (hpi). In contrast, mice infected with the S-layer deficient derivative strain FM2.5 showed consistently less weight loss (average 6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Measurement of total <italic>C. difficile</italic> in faecal material showed comparable levels of shedding at 24 and 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), while analysis of total <italic>C. difficile</italic> present in caecal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and colonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) material taken at post-mortem indicated a trend for less recovery of FM2.5 24 hpi.

However, at 48 and 96 hpi, comparable levels of toxin were recovered. Histological examination (at 48 hpi) showed that mice infected with R20291 displayed significantly greater pathology than those infected with FM2.5 and a PBS challenged control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> i-vi.

In contrast, FM2.5 produces smaller and smoother colonies, which take <sup>~</sup>24 h to emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Following infection of mice with R20291 and FM2.5, faecal material was recovered and plated daily. During examination of resultant colonies, it was noted that, while colonies from R20291 infected mice showed the expected morphology, material retrieved from FM2.5-infected mice showed a mixture of both large (FM2.5<sub>large</sub>) and small colony types (FM2.5<sub>small</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, FM2.5<sub>large</sub>, were countable after 16 h incubation, while the expected FM2.5-like colonies, FM2.5<sub>small</sub>, were only observable from 24 h. Several colonies from both types, FM2.5<sub>small</sub> and FM2.5<sub>large</sub>, were streaked from the original plates and were sub-cultured twice to ensure clonality. Individual clones were then stored at -80°C.</p><p id="P17">Amplification of the <italic>slpA</italic> sequence from these clones revealed that the FM2.5<sub>large</sub> colonies contained modifications in the genomic sequence upstream of the FM2.5 mutation site (single nucleotide insertion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Several sequence variants were identified, with two most common mutants named Revertant A (RvA) and Revertant B (RvB). In RvA, a single nucleotide deletion (246delT) restored the original reading frame, rescuing translation of the full SlpA<italic>;</italic> modifying three amino acid residues in the translated protein. In, RvB, an insertion of five-nucleotides (249_253insCTTAG), which again restored the reading frame and resulted in modification of 13 amino acids within the mature protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref> Interestingly, revertants were identified in several <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, using batches of independently prepared spores.</p><p id="P18">To confirm expression of SlpA, low pH cell surface extracts of strains RvA and RvB were analysed.

This was confirmed through western immunoblot analysis using anti-SLPH and anti-SLPL antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e and f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reversion can affect SlpA structure and assembly</title><p id="P19">To understand the effects of the detected reversions on SlpA structure and S-layer assembly, crystallisation of SlpA<sub>R20291</sub>, SlpA<sub>RvA</sub> and SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> was carried out. Although crystals were obtained for all three variants, only SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> crystals were of sufficient quality for x-ray diffraction data collection and structural determination by molecular replacement, using previous SlpA structures as models, including a variant of SlpA<sub>R20291</sub> lacking the most exposed region of SLP<sub>L</sub> - SlpA<sub>R△D2</sub> - (PDB ID: 7ACZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>). SLP<sub>H</sub> and the interacting domains were easily traceable in the electron density but D1 was only partially built, whilst density for domain D2 was very poor and this region could not be traced in the final SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, PDB ID: 8BBY, Table S1). This implies that D2 is flexible and/or unstructured, while the structure of the core domains required for S-layer assembly - SLP<sub>H</sub>, and, to a lesser extent, D1 and LID/HID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>) - seems to be generally maintained. However, the relative orientation of these domains in the SlpA molecule is altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with D1 and the interacting domains rotated towards the SLP<sub>H</sub> plane by <sup>~</sup>30 ° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The 13 altered residues in α2<sub>L</sub> in SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> result in disruption of the α-helix secondary structure and introduce disorder in the upstream loop that links the preceding β-strand (β3<sub>L</sub>) and α2<sub>L</sub>. It is worth noting that SLP<sub>H</sub> in R20291, which belongs to SLCT 4, has several insertions within the cell wall binding 2 (CWB2) sequence motifs that define CWPs in <italic>C. difficile</italic>, when compared to other SlpA types. These insertions could not be traced in our SlpA<sub>RΔD2</sub> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>) but were traceable in the SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> and result in several loops protruding above the SLPH plane, towards the environment, partially occluding the CWB2 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, right). Together with the movement of the interacting domains and D1 towards the SLP<sub>H</sub> tiles, this creates a more compressed arrangement (<sup>~</sup>66 Å compared to <sup>~</sup>76 Å in SlpACD630, PDB ID: 7ACY, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, bottom).</p><p id="P20">In the crystallographic models of SlpA<sub>CD630</sub> (PDB ID: 7ACY), SlpAR7404 (PDB ID: 7ACX) and SlpA<sub>RΔD2</sub> (PDB ID: 7ACZ), α2<sub>L</sub> was responsible for closing a gap between neighbouring SlpA molecules via D1-D1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>). In the crystallographic model of the R20291-derived SlpA<sub>RΔD2</sub> variant, D1-D1 interactions are mediated by hydrogen bonds between S50<sub>L</sub>-S50<sub>L</sub> and Q70<sub>L</sub>-A49<sub>L</sub> from neighbouring molecules.</p><p id="P21">In the SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> structure, disruption of α2<sub>L</sub> and reorientation of D1 and LID/HID relative to SLP<sub>H</sub> leads to changes in the interactions between neighbouring molecules and, consequently, a rearrangement of the S-layer array. Strikingly, the D1-D1 interactions seen in previous models were not observed here, possibly due to the flexibility of α2<sub>L</sub> and preceding loop caused by the changes in the reverted sequence leading to a different orientation of D1 domains. Unlike in the previously determined structures, neighbouring D1 domains in the SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> structure are too far apart to mediate contacts (&gt; 12 Å). In the previous models, SLP<sub>H</sub> tiling creates two wide channels, which are stabilised by interactions mediated by the interacting domains and D1 (Lanzoni-Manguthi, 2022). A different mode of stabilising the SLP<sub>H</sub> tiling is observed in SlpA<sub>RvB</sub>, with the interacting domains now partially inserted in those cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Fig. S2a). A new interacting interface between HID from one molecule and CWB2<sub>3</sub> occludes these gaps and stabilises the S-layer lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, Fig. S2a). This new arrangement of the crystal lattice is in line with our proposed assembly model, where the S-layer 2D array is maintained mostly by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges across surfaces with complementary charges (Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al., 2022), largely dependent on SLP<sub>H</sub>-SLP<sub>H</sub> interactions and stabilised by varying degree of interactions involving SLPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and Table S2). The structural model of RvB confirms that changes in SLP<sub>L</sub> can be accommodated with minor structural changes to the (sub)domains, by exploring flexible loops and hinges to provide a stable S-layer.</p><p id="P22">As no crystal data was obtainable, we also calculated models for SlpAR2021 and SlpA<sub>RvA</sub> using the SWISS-MODEL server, based on previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al. 2022</xref>) and the SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> structure determined here. Depending on which template was used (SlpA<sub>R△D2</sub> or SlpÅRvB), different predicted structures of SlpA<sub>RvA</sub> were obtained, varying mostly in the orientation of D1 and interacting domains relative to SLPH (Fig. S2b). Interestingly, one common feature was that the changes resulting from the revertant sequence seem to be accommodated not by altering the α-helix but by varying the length of the upstream loop that links the preceding β-strand (β3<sub>L</sub>) and α2<sub>L</sub>(Fig. S2b). It is therefore unclear if SlpA<sub>RvA</sub> is more likely to adopt a R20291-like as observed in the SlpA<sub>R△D2</sub> model or RvB-like S-layer assembly, as both can accommodate the modified sequence.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> S-layer selection is independent of toxin expression</title><p id="P23">FM2.5 has previously been observed to show a delay in toxin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>), consequently we chose to investigate whether <italic>slpA</italic> reversion was accompanied by a potential restoration of toxin production <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Analysis revealed differences in gene expression between R20291 and FM2.5, with over 287 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), linked to alterations in metabolism, transport, membrane integrity and sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, less differences were observed when R20291 was compared to RvA (44 DEGs), than RvB (185 DEGs), which showed similar numbers of DEGs to FM2.5. This correlates well with the observed behaviour of these strains within animals (RvA associated with WT-like disease and RvB with FM2.5-like attenuation). Analysis of these data suggest that differences in observed disease severity could be linked to changes in transcription of several virulence-associated traits, including toxin A and B, and genes associated with sporulation. While the recovery of an intact S-layer would appear sufficient in the case of RvA, to restore wild type gene transcription, only partial transcription profile restoration, including toxin expression, is observed in RvB. However, as toxic activity was observed at 36h in culture, the alterations in transcription control seen in FM2.5 and RvB would appear to be limited to timing rather than absolute prevention of toxin production.</p><p id="P30">Taken together, these data suggest that expression of the S-layer plays a key role in <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease within the host.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">The S-layer of <italic>C. difficile</italic> has long been considered as integral to its physiology and pathogenesis, with several roles reported, including adherence to the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Merrigan et al., 2013</xref>), immune cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) , sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>) and sporulation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). Here, we describe the pathogenesis of the S-layer-null mutant FM2.5 within the mouse model of disease and report the recovery of toxin-independent, spontaneous S-layer variants in which SlpA expression is restored. This unexpected but reproducible phenomenon supports the growing evidence that this structure plays a key role in adaptation and survival within the host.</p><p id="P32">FM2.5, a strain originally selected through its resistance to the R-type bacteriocin Av-CD291.2, was previously reported to be attenuated in the Syrian hamster model of <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). These studies indicated that SlpA was essential for disease, with no diarrhoeal symptoms observed in infected animals, despite the recovery of FM2.5 from the caecum and colon of infected hamsters 14 days pi. While here we confirmed that the attenuated phenotype was reproducible in mice, we also detected SlpA revertant clones from infected animals. Interestingly, SlpA revertants were not observed during hamster infections, despite using the same chromogenic agar for recovery of FM2.5 isolates from infected animals.</p><p id="P33">Isolation of FM2.5 SlpA revertants in mice but not in hamsters suggests that differences in the local environmental conditions between the hamster and mouse may influence the amplification and outgrowth of these S-layer variant strains.</p><p id="P34">Indeed, it has been suggested that <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonisation efficiency may reflect variation in expression of cathelicidins (such as LL-37) within these hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Woods et al. 2018</xref>), which would help to explain why revertants were not amplified in the hamster gut. This observation also lends support to the hypothesis that an intact S-layer confers resistance to the antimicrobial activity of enzymes (such as lysozyme) and antimicrobial peptides (LL-37) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). The observation that FM2.5 is acutely sensitive to LL-37 and lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>) and becomes resistant following S-layer restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi, 2022</xref>) further supports the premise that revertants with an intact S-layer have a competitive advantage <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P35">Selection and amplification of the revertants in this study further highlights the competitive advantage offered by the S-layer in <italic>C. difficile</italic> intestinal survival. Poor recovery of <italic>C. difficile</italic> at 24 hpi in FM2.5-infected mice could also be linked to lower or less efficient rates of germination by FM2.5 compared to R20291. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using taurocholic acid as a germinant, indicate that these strains show equivalent rates of germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>). Alternatively, lower rates of FM2.5 at 24h hours could be a result of an increased susceptibility of the SlpA-null mutant to anti-microbial peptides within the gut. The equivalent recovered numbers at 48 and 72h for infections with FM2.5 when compared to R20291 may correspond to an increased population of revertant clones, considering the high level of reversion, as quantified by genetic analysis.</p><p id="P36">Although SlpA variants have not been observed during sequential growth of the FM2.5 isolate <italic>in vitro,</italic> several factors may influence their presence, albeit at low numbers, within the inoculum used to infect mice. As a largely obligate anaerobe, the sensitivity of <italic>C. difficile</italic> vegetative cells to oxygen complicates their use in animal models of infection. In contrast, the preparation and use of spores correlates with the natural infection and avoids co-administration of toxins expressed during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. However, as FM2.5 has a known reduced sporulation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>), it is possible that any variants expressing an intact S-layer present would sporulate more efficiently and therefore represent a higher proportion of the inoculum used for infection. Sequence analysis of <italic>slpA</italic> of several different batches of FM2.5 spores supported this hypothesis, with a small (&gt;2.5%) proportion of the population displaying variations upstream of the original <italic>slpA</italic> mutation.</p><p id="P37">A delay in toxin production by FM2.5 has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kirk et al. 2017</xref>) which, coupled with the apparent delayed growth <italic>in vivo,</italic> could account for the difference in weight loss between R20291 and FM2.5 infected mice after 24 hpi. Using our <italic>FM2.5ΔPaLoc</italic> strain, we were able to demonstrate that the weight loss is entirely dependent on toxin production. However, this raises the question as to why animals infected with FM2.5, that show high and equivalent levels of tissue colonisation by 48 hpi, do not show equivalent levels of weight loss and tissue inflammation as R20291 infected animals. Several studies have shown that the S-layer is essential in immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jarchum et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mamareli et al. 2019</xref>), driving the production of proinflammatory cytokines via TLR4/MyD88 dependent pathways and enhancing the toxin-activated inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Cowardin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">McDermott et al., 2016</xref>). Together, this implies that the timing or spatial localisation of toxins and the S-layer relative to the epithelial barrier could be crucial to immune activation. This is further supported by the observation that RvB showed an equivalent reduction in toxin expression to FM2.5 in the RNA-Seq analysis and a reduction in disease severity in the mouse.</p><p id="P38">Alternatively, as a feedback mechanism between sporulation and the complex regulatory network controlling toxin production has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Deakin et al. 2012</xref>), it is possible that a defect in FM2.5 sporulation may result in a delay in toxin production. The observed reduction in toxin activity at 36h in the filtered culture supernatant from FM2.5 correlated well with the log2 fold reduction in <italic>tcdB</italic> transcripts (-4.14) and <italic>tcdA</italic> (-2.24) in mRNA recovered from FM2.5 cultures grown for 6h, when compared to transcripts recovered from R20291 cultures, at the equivalent timepoint. In contrast, RvB which also presented a reduction in toxin gene expression compared to R20291 by RNA-Seq, demonstrated equivalent toxin functional activity to R20291 when grown <italic>in vitro</italic> for 36h; RvA and R20291 showed comparable toxin expression in both systems. This suggests that whilst modifications in S-layer can result in delays to toxin production, these changes do not prevent or limit final activity supporting the hypothesis that disease severity might be linked to the timing and co-ordination of S-layer and toxin by the host.</p><p id="P39">Mice infected with either RvA or RvB showed different disease severity, as indicated by differences in weight loss. The low virulence of an RvB infection may be, in part, explained by the structural differences. Indeed, structural analysis of SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> revealed a new packing of SlpA molecules in the array, with a rearrangement of the position of SLPH and both interacting domains, now involved in tiling of the S-layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests a considerable degree of adaptability of both SLPL, where the reversion is located, and SLPH, to accommodate varying interactions between neighbouring molecules. The absence of density to model D2 in SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> further illustrates that this domain is dispensable for S-layer assembly, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al., 2022</xref>). As S-layer assembly is maintained mostly by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lanzoni-Mangutchi et al., 2022</xref>), rearrangement of the subdomains to create structures with complementary surface charges seems to enable the different assemblies observed so far. These changes in quaternary structure, with minor changes of secondary and tertiary structure of the subdomains, suggests that the ability to form a paracrystalline array is central to S-layer function and can be achieved in different arrangements. The S-layer must retain a certain degree of flexibility, not only to account for the cell pole curvature and allow cell division, but also for incorporation of minor cell wall proteins that enhance functionality. The presence of a more intricate network of interactions and more extensive interface areas when compared to the R20291-related SlpA<sub>R△D2</sub> structure (Table S2) between neighbouring molecules seen in the SlpA<sub>RvB</sub> structure suggests a potentially less flexible paracrystalline array, with less ability to incorporate specific functions of minor CWPs, which may help to explain differences in disease patterns observed between RvB and the other revertant strain, RvA; the structure of which needs to be studied in more detail. Further structural studies of SlpA<sub>RvA</sub> revertant and SlpA<sub>R20291</sub> as well as detailed analysis of S-layer assembly and composition, including the capacity to incorporate other minor cell wall proteins, will help elucidate the role of specific aspects of the S-layer.</p><p id="P40">While identification of SlpA revertants was unexpected and adds complexity to the interpretation of the data from the mouse disease model, the rapid recovery of these strains highlights the key contribution that the expression of an intact S-layer offers to <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection <italic>in vivo.</italic> This work supports previous observations that strains lacking the S-layer are less virulent <italic>in vivo,</italic> although it remains difficult to identify the specific contribution of the S-layer in the infection process.

To ensure maximal lysis of bacteria and recovery of RNA, the bacterial pellet was additionally subject to treatment with 100 ml lysozyme solution (10 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> in 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH8.0] 0.1 mM EDTA), 0.5 ml 10% SDS solution and 350 ml of Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen PureLink RNA Mini Kit) containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were then homogenised using MP Biomedical beads (0.1 mm) and bead beater (MP Biomedical FastPrep24) with cells subject to 2 cycles of 60 s beating, followed by incubation on ice for 2 min. Total RNA was then extracted using the standard PureLink RNA mini kit protocol, according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author Summary</title></caption><p>The S-layer of <italic>C. difficile</italic> is a paracrystalline array that covers the outer surface of the bacterial cell but its contribution to overall disease remains unclear. A previously described, spontaneous <italic>slpA-null</italic> mutant, FM2.5, with a point mutation in <italic>slpA</italic> offered an opportunity to study the role of the S-layer <italic>in vivo.</italic> Here, we confirm that this strain is less virulent <italic>in vivo</italic> despite effectively colonising the host and producing toxin. We also show <italic>in vivo</italic> selection for sequence modifications that restore <italic>slp</italic>A translation and produce an S-layer. While such modifications do not affect the overall 3D structure of individual SlpA (sub)domains, they can lead to altered orientation of the structural domains and subsequent S-layer assembly. Importantly, RNA-Seq analysis <italic>in vitro</italic> showed large differences in gene expression between FM2.5 and R20291. Detected differences in transcription of genes involved in toxin expression and sporulation suggests that the S-layer provides a selective survival advantage within the host, which contributes to disease severity.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>SlpA deficient <italic>C. difficile</italic> is less pathogenic in a murine model of infection.</title><p>Female C57/Bl6 mice were challenged with spores of R20291 or FM2.5, or mock infected with sterile PBS.
