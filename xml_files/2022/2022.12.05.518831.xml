However, key environmental factors shaping the molecular and phenotypic evolution of the olfactory sensory system remain mostly unknown. Here, we investigate the association between diverse ecological traits and the number of olfactory chemoreceptors in the genomes of more than two hundred ray-finned fishes. We found independent expansions producing large gene repertoires in nocturnal amphibious fishes, generally able to perform active terrestrial exploration. Furthermore, we reinforced this finding with an additional analysis of a clariid species (<italic>Channallabes apus</italic>), a fish lineage with chemosensory-based aerial orientation. Importantly, we also detected an augmented information-processing capacity in the olfactory bulb of examined nocturnal amphibious species. Overall, we report a convergent magnification of the olfactory system in amphibious fishes potentially enhancing terrestrial orientation, revealing the likelihood of an analogous event in tetrapod ancestors during the water-to-land transition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">At the onset of sensory system evolution in early vertebrates, a few types of chemoreceptor genes acquired roles in the perception of smell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. As a result, olfaction in this lineage is mediated by four distinct receptor families: odorant receptors (ORs), trace-amine associated receptors (TAARs), vomeronasal type 1 receptors (V1Rs) and vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V2Rs). Earlier comparative studies on these olfactory (OLF) genes reported striking differences in the number of duplicates among species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In particular, studied fishes showed a smaller number of receptors compared to many terrestrial vertebrates, supporting the idea that aerial and water mediums present distinct chemoreception requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, high repertoire variability has been recently detected in teleosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, although the selective pressures explaining these differences are mostly unknown.</p><p id="P4">Unlike tetrapods, all OLF gene families are transcribed in a single paired olfactory organ in fishes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This structure, usually organized in a rosette-like epithelium, contains numerous sensory neurons dedicated to the perception of chemical signals. Each of those neurons is specialized in the detection of particular odorant molecules through transcriptional activation of only one among all receptor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, neurons expressing an identical receptor project their axons to a particular region within the olfactory bulb (OB), establishing synapses with the mitral cells located in the same glomeruli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This neural organization allows the decoding of a complex chemosensory input into topological information in the brain. Interestingly, great variation in the relative size of the OB is observed among vertebrate species including fishes, which has been often interpreted as a proxy for smell abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, whether genetic variability involving OLF gene repertoires is linked to the information-processing capacity in the brain, reflecting a functional impact, remains largely unexplored.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Independent olfactory gene expansions in ray-finned fishes</title><p id="P5">We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of the OLF genes in a large and diverse set of ray-finned fish species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We identified OR, TAAR, V1R and V2R genes in high-quality genomes of more than two hundred species from approximately fifty taxonomic orders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). While half of the species presented less than 250 OLF genes in total, we found a striking variability ranging from 29 genes in the common seadragon to more than 1300 in the ropefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Remarkably, we observed large repertoires with more than twice the median value (&gt;500 OLF genes) in species from seven distinct orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Lineages presenting such expansions include bichirs, true eels, characins, sleeper gobies, true soles, labyrinth fishes and spiny eels. In particular, the total number of receptor genes in the bichirs is comparable to many olfactory-oriented mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Contrary to other clades, none of these species experienced lineage-specific whole genome duplications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting that olfactory gene dynamics are fast and probably associated with macroevolutionary ecological drifts.</p><p id="P7">As OLF genes are organized in clusters, we investigated the genomic architecture of the detected expansions. We found the number of gene clusters variable among distantly related clades due to gains, losses and genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In species with an expanded repertoire, we observed an uneven distribution of genes per cluster, with a few loci accumulating a high number of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These local inflations affected OR, TAAR and/or V2R families unequally in each lineage, producing specific amplification patterns affecting distinct gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Because expansions are generated by tandem duplications, groups of receptors from the same gene clusters present the highest sequence similarities within species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). As an exception, we identified an OR cluster in the zig-zag eel containing receptors very similar to genes from a remote cluster, suggesting a very recent evolutionary origin. However, identical receptors are generally scarce, indicating the prevalence of coding divergence after duplication events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To study how gene number evolution affects the transcriptional balance between receptors in the olfactory organ, we sequenced and analysed the transcriptomes of eight species with differently sized repertoires. We found substantial variation in the transcriptomic abundance of OR, TAAR, V1R and V2R families among lineages, roughly matching their genomic proportions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Moreover, we observed a minority of individual receptors (15-20%) accumulating half of the overall OLF gene expression in studied fishes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). To investigate whether expanded gene clusters are represented at the transcriptomic level, we focused in more detail on the three species with greater repertoires (&gt;600 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We found the largest gene cluster in the zig-zag eel as the most abundant both in terms of accumulated and average gene expression. Similarly, the other fishes also concentrate higher fractions of the total OLF expression in their bigger clusters. However, these two species showed higher transcriptional rates per gene in clusters other than the largest, with the remarkable case of a small but extremely expressed TAAR cluster in the climbing perch. Overall, transcriptomic abundances at the family and cluster level globally reflect gene expansions, despite regulatory mechanisms able to locally enhance the expression of individual receptors in a locus-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Olfactory molecular evolution linked to ecology and brain processing capacity</title><p id="P9">To identify environmental causes influencing the number of OLF genes in ray-finned fishes, we estimated the effect of distinct ecological, life-history and behavioural traits with a potential impact on smell evolution. We found a significant deviation towards larger repertoires in three of the studied factors: freshwater habitats, nocturnal activity, and amphibious behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that fishes presenting the exact combination of these three traits include many of the more expanded repertoires in our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, most of these species are reported to perform active terrestrial exploration to find new water bodies or prey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, testing the influence of terrestrial exploration on the number of receptors as a single trait revealed the largest significant effect detected with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, diurnal amphibious fishes such as mudskippers, bullheads or some toothcarps, rarely found more than a few meters from water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, do not present enlarged olfactory repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Perhaps relatedly, some of these diurnal species are described to use vision to orientate towards their original aquatic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, we suggest that nocturnal amphibious lineages might particularly benefit from an increase of their OLF gene repertoires, especially for terrestrial exploratory excursions involving relatively large distances.</p><p id="P10">Terrestrial orientation through aerial chemoreception in fish has been recently reported for the first time in a clariid species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This siluriform clade is known to emerge from water nocturnally to move between ponds or streams. In order to investigate whether this amphibious lineage also presents an expanded OLF gene repertoire, we sequenced the genome of the eel catfish, <italic>Channallabes apus (C. apus)</italic> (see Methods), a tropical clariid able to hunt for terrestrial prey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Using our high-quality assembly, we identified expansions of the TAAR and V1R gene families compared to other siluriform and teleost species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), reinforcing the association of nocturnal amphibious behaviour with increased receptor repertoires. It is worth mentioning that aerial chemoreception in clariids was previously hypothesized to function mainly through the barbels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, a gustatory organ. In particular, it was proposed that the nasal barbels might have co-opted the expression of olfactory receptors to increase their sensory capabilities. However, we only detected robust expression of OLF genes in the olfactory epithelium and not in the barbels of <italic>C. apus</italic>, indicating that the sensory role of these receptor families is restricted to smell and not taste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next studied whether fishes with large OLF gene repertoires present an augmented information-processing capacity in their olfactory bulbs (OB), frequently used as a proxy for smell functional abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, comparison of volume ratios in distantly related species are problematic as similarly sized brains can differ in the number and distribution of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we directly estimated the cell number of dissected brain parts from twenty-four ray-finned fish species using the isotropic fractionator (see Methods). With this approach, we detected a positive correlation between the amount of receptor genes and the number of OB cells relative to other brain cells (PGLS, p=0.076, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Furthermore, nocturnal amphibious fishes presented a higher proportion of OB cells compared to the rest of species, after correcting for phylogeny and brain size (p= 0.0004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Hence, our results link the detected genetic variability with a sensory phenotypic trait and provide further evidence for enhanced olfactory abilities in amphibious lineages with expanded OLF gene repertoires.</p><p id="P12">Last, we investigated whether gene expansions in nocturnal amphibious fishes occurred in the same subtype of receptors most abundant in tetrapods, called γ-OR genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). While we found them absent or scarce in amphibious teleost species, we identified a substantial number of γ-OR in the bichirs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the majority of γ receptors in this lineage located in a gene cluster that was lost before the teleost radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), but still present in other ray-finned fishes. Thus, increments in the number of chemoreceptors happened in distinct subtypes in most amphibious fishes compared to tetrapods, maybe related to this ancient loss.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">We explored potential associations of several ecological and behavioural traits with olfaction-related changes in ray-finned fishes. We found that nocturnal amphibious lineages have convergently expanded their olfactory sensory system molecularly and in terms of OB processing capacity in the brain. From a greater phylogenetic perspective, this finding resembles the case of amphibians, which present particularly high numbers of OLF genes presumably linked to distinct olfaction requirements in their aquatic and terrestrial forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, cetaceans and sea snakes have severely reduced OR repertoires compared to land species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, showing a consistent evolutionary response to the physical medium in both directions in vertebrates. Therefore, we suggest that these increments in the odour processing capacity of nocturnal amphibious fishes are likely connected to facilitate terrestrial orientation, a potentially useful skill during the search of new water bodies or prey. Moreover, we further strengthened this evolutionary scenario with on purpose genome sequencing and analysis of a clariid species (<italic>C. apus</italic>), an amphibious fish clade with previously described aerial chemosensory abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, as we also identified substantial gene repertoires in a small subset of exclusively aquatic species, additional ecological causes leading to olfactory genomic variability in fishes remain to be discovered.</p><p id="P14">In addition, we also identified in the bichirs a substantial number of genes homologous to the most abundant receptor subtype in land vertebrates, named γ-OR. This particular group of chemoreceptors was considered to exclusively detect airborne odorants by earlier studies based on their absence in the first studied teleost genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although not completely missing, we hypothesize that the prevailing scarcity of γ-OR genes in this lineage might be at least partially related to the loss of a particular genomic cluster before the diversification of teleosts. However, this receptor subtype is markedly present in non-amphibious fishes from other clades such as the spotted gar or the coelacanth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, suggesting an ancestral function in water environments. In fact, it is increasingly recognised that aquatic animals are able to detect small hydrophobic and volatile compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, we speculate that some of the chemosensory expansions found in amphibious species might occurred in receptor genes already able to bind volatile molecules present in water. Finally, given that extant sarcopterygian fishes show modest OLF gene repertoires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we propose that an analogous magnification of the olfactory system probably happened during the first steps of the water-to-land transition in early tetrapods. Thereby, fast chemosensory changes could have preceded many key morphological adaptations in arguably one of the most crucial events during vertebrate evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>OLF genes annotation and analysis of clusters</title><p id="P15">We developed a pipeline to identify olfactory genes in 201 high-quality ray-finned fish with publicly available genome assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). First, available reference protein sequences of OR, TAAR, V1R and V2R receptors from several species belonging to separate actinopterygian clades (spotted gar, zebrafish, stickleback, fugu, tongue sole, European seabass, Nile tilapia, mandarin fish, salmon and medaka)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> were blasted against target genome assemblies (tblastn, e-value &lt; 1e-35). Only best hits were recovered in case of overlapping between queries. We built preliminary gene models grouping high scoring pairs belonging to different parts of the same queries to account for putative introns when necessary (maximum intron size of 10Kb for OR, TAAR and V1R and 30Kb for V2R). We extracted the genomic sequence spanning the gene models with an extension of three kilobases on each side. These sequences were processed with Exonerate (EMBL-EBI) using the original reference to generate optimized gene models (minimum identity of 35%). Next, we obtained the coding sequence of these new models with TransDecoder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder">https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder</ext-link>) and kept those equal or larger than 275 aminoacids for OR, TAAR, V1R, and 700 aminoacids for V2R. The obtained sequences were blasted against a database containing OR, TAAR, V1R or V2R protein sequences and other G-protein coupled receptor families (HODER database) to filter out non-OLF receptors (blastp, e-value &lt; 1e-35). We repeated the whole process in each species using the new obtained gene models as references to further recover divergent unannotated OLF genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Also, to avoid wrong estimates in our analysis, we restricted the dataset to publicly available high-quality genome assemblies. We only collected those assemblies that surpassed two <italic>a priori</italic> and one <italic>a posteriori</italic> filters: (i) The N50 metric divided by the total length of the genome was at least 10Mb/Gb. (ii) The minimum required BUSCO.v3 completeness (actinopterygii10 database) was 90% for all species except for Polypteriformes, as a minimum of 85% was tolerated for the outgroup lineage within our dataset. (iii) To account for excessive genomic fragmentation, annotated OR genes needed to be distributed in less than twenty scaffolds or chromosomes, while in species with lineage-specific whole genome duplications up to thirty scaffolds were allowed. Gene cluster homologies among species were inferred based on syntenic genes flanking studied loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To unveil the cluster duplication dynamics, protein-level identity values from pairwise sequence alignments of analysed receptor genes were calculated with Clustal omega (EMBL-EBI). CD-HIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit">https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit</ext-link>) was used for grouping OLF genes with distinct levels of sequence identity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fish samples</title><p id="P17">Some of the studied species were obtained through the aquarium trade (Aquarium Glaser GmbH, Rodgau, Germany): <italic>Anabas testudineus, Pygocentrus nattereri, Electrophorus electricus, Erpetoichthys calabaricus, Polypterus senegalus, Mastacembelus armatus, Xenentodon cancila, Thalassophryne amazonica, Gambusia affinis, Xiphophorus helleri</italic> and <italic>Channallabes apus</italic>.

RNA sequencing was performed by Novogene to obtain 30-55 million reads from an Illumina platform (paired end, 150 x 2 base pairs) per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Reads were filtered with Fastp software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We estimated the expression of annotated receptors by balancing the number of uniquely and ambiguously mapped reads using Salmon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

This approach also reduced potential bias due to contamination of surrounding non-olfactory tissues compared to absolute measurements. Mean values obtained from biological replicates for each gene were used. Nevertheless, one particular V2R gene located outside of the main gene cluster of this family and lacking receptor activity is known to be co-expressed with other V2R genes in previously studied vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we identified homolog singletons of this gene with very high expression in our studied fish species (data not shown). Hence, we decided to eliminate it from the expression analysis to avoid overestimation in V2R abundance.

We performed robust linear regression using the student family, specifying the following weakly informative priors: prior(normal(0, 1), “b”), prior(normal(2, 0.5), “Intercept”), prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), “sd”), prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), “sigma”), prior(gamma(3, 0.1), “nu”). Prior predictive checks confirmed that these priors set reasonable expectations for the model coefficients. To check for prior sensitivity, we also ran the model with default priors and the model inference was not changed. We ran 4 MCMC chains for 20,000 iterations with a warm-up period of 10,000 and thinning every 10 steps, resulting in 4000 post-warmup draws. Proper chain mixing was checked by visually inspecting the trace plots. Additionally, Rhat for all parameters was &lt; 1.003 and the bulk and tail effective sample sizes for all parameters were at least 500 and typically over 80% of total post-warmup draws, indicative of model convergence. Bayesian R<sup>2</sup> was calculated using the bayes_R2 function in the brms package. The phylogenetic signal was estimated using the hypothesis function in the brms package, following the brms vignette (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_phylogenetics.hhtm">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_phylogenetics.hhtm</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title><italic>Channallabes apus</italic> genome sequencing</title><p id="P21">Long genomic DNA (gDNA) of <italic>Channallabes apus</italic> was extracted with the circulomics Nanobind Tissue Big DNA kit (part number NB-900-701-01, protocol version Nanobind Tissue Big DNA Kit Handbook v1.0 (11/19)) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, liver tissue was minced to small slices on a clean and cold surface and finally homogenized with the TissueRuptor II device (Qiagen) making use of its maximal settings. After complete tissue lysis, remaining cell debris were removed, and the gDNA was bound to circulomics Nanobind discs in the presence of Isopropanol. High molecular weight (HMW) gDNA was eluted from the nanobind discs in elution buffer (EB). The integrity of the HMW gDNA was determined by pulse field gel electrophoresis using the Femto Pulse device (Agilent Technologies) showing a clear peak 127 kb in length.
