However, as cholesterol concentration rises above the PM’s sequestration capacity, a new pool of cholesterol, called accessible cholesterol, emerges. The transport of accessible cholesterol between the PM and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. This pathway has also been implicated in the suppression of both bacterial and viral pathogens by immunomodulatory oxysterols. Here, we describe a mechanism of depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). We show that 25HC-mediated activation of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the ER creates an imbalance in the equilibrium distribution of accessible cholesterol between the ER and PM. This imbalance triggers the rapid internalization of accessible cholesterol from the PM, which is sustained for long periods of time through 25HC-mediated suppression of SREBPs. In support of a physiological role for this mechanism, 25HC failed to suppress Zika virus and human coronavirus infection in ACAT-deficient cells, and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection in ACAT-deficient cells and mice. We propose that selective depletion of accessible PM cholesterol triggered by ACAT activation and sustained through SREBP suppression underpins the immunological activities of 25HC and a functionally related class of oxysterols.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Cholesterol is an essential component of the membranes of animal cells and its levels are tightly regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms that control its production, uptake, and intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Dysregulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis is implicated in many human diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). There is also growing evidence that membrane cholesterol modulation plays key roles in host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). While the proteins and pathways that mediate cholesterol regulation have been extensively studied, how these processes are rapidly altered during infection remains poorly defined.</p><p id="P5">Most of a mammalian cell’s cholesterol is concentrated in the plasma membrane (PM), where the molecule makes up 40 – 50% of the total lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The steady state levels of PM cholesterol are regulated by balancing the flow of cholesterol into and out of the PM. Inflows to the PM originate from two locations – i) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where cholesterol is synthesized; and ii) lysosomes where cholesterol is liberated from low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that bind to LDL receptors on the PM and are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Upon arrival at the PM from these locations, the incoming cholesterol forms complexes with sphingomyelin (SM) and other PM phospholipids, which imparts the PM with structural properties required for proper cellular function and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Cholesterol in excess of the sequestering capacity of PM phospholipids forms a pool that has been termed “accessible cholesterol” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Expansion of this pool signals cholesterol overaccumulation and triggers flow of accessible cholesterol out of the cell by PM cholesterol efflux proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), or into the cell by cholesterol transporters that move the lipid to organelles such as the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The accessible cholesterol that is transported to the ER interacts with two regulatory membrane proteins, a cholesterol sensor called Scap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and a cholesterol-modifying enzyme called acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Binding of cholesterol to Scap prevents the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors that upregulate genes for lipid production, including those for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The ACAT enzyme converts some of the incoming cholesterol to cholesteryl esters for storage in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional and enzymatic responses induced by accessible cholesterol arriving at the ER combine to reduce cellular cholesterol and protect the PM from cholesterol overaccumulation.</p><p id="P7">While accessible cholesterol in the PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and regulating cell growth, this pool of cholesterol can also be a vulnerability as it is exploited by numerous bacteria and viruses to promote infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Fortunately, animal cells have devised a clever solution to rectify this vulnerability. The solution involves an innate immune response that stimulates the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), an enzyme that attaches a hydroxyl group to the iso-octyl sidechain of cholesterol to generate 25- hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a potent signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). 25HC produced by macrophage cells in response to infection acts in a paracrine manner to induce rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol, but not cholesterol in complexes with SM, from the PMs of nearby cells. Such depletion prevents the spread of infection by bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) as well as cellular infection by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In addition, 25HC acts in an autocrine manner to prevent macrophage lysis by bacterial pore-forming toxins that target accessible cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Establishing the mechanisms of how 25HC rapidly depletes accessible cholesterol from PMs has been complicated due to this oxysterol’s actions on multiple cholesterol homeostatic pathways, including <italic>i)</italic> binding to Insigs, which suppresses the activation of SREBPs and reduces cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>); <italic>ii)</italic> activating Liver X receptors (LXRs), transcription factors that upregulate genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>); and <italic>iii)</italic> stimulating the activity of ACAT, which esterifies cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Each of these actions would lower levels of total cellular cholesterol, which would then be expected to lower accessible cholesterol in PMs. The recent studies on 25HC’s role in restricting pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) have pointed to the involvement of two of these pathways - ACAT and SREBP - in depleting accessible cholesterol from PMs, however several questions remain unanswered. First, what is the primary target of 25HC that initiates depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM? Second, what is the underlying mechanism by which 25HC depletes PMs of accessible cholesterol? Third, how does 25HC sustain low levels of accessible PM cholesterol over long time periods necessary to disrupt the lifecycles of pathogens <italic>in vivo?</italic> Finally, does 25HC inhibit both bacterial and viral infections through a common mechanism?</p><p id="P9">Here, using a panel of oxysterols with diverse structures and cell lines deficient in key components that regulate cholesterol homeostasis, we find that rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs by 25HC is solely determined by ACAT activity. Stimulation of ACAT by 25HC siphons off cholesterol that arrives at the ER for conversion to cholesteryl esters, forcing a redistribution of cellular cholesterol, which ultimately leads to a decrease in accessible PM cholesterol. Once initiated through ACAT, the depletion of accessible PM cholesterol persists for longer periods through 25HC’s inhibition of transcriptional pathways responsible for cholesterol synthesis and uptake. In the absence of ACAT, 25HC no longer protects cells from lysis by cytolysins secreted by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis,</italic> infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> or infection by Zika virus and coronaviruses. Moreover, in an ACAT-deficient animal model, 25HC-mediated protection of the spleen and liver from infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is reduced. Together, these studies unite the disparate reports of anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties of 25HC through a common mechanism orchestrated by ACAT.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Side-chain oxysterols like 25HC trigger rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs</title><p id="P10">To carry out a detailed examination of the effects of 25HC on PM cholesterol, we chose Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a model cellular system since these cells have been used for more than two decades to study cholesterol regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). To detect accessible cholesterol in PMs of live cells, we used domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4), a non-lytic protein sensor that specifically detects this pool of cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). When a line of CHO cells designated CHO-K1 were grown in cholesterol-rich fetal calf serum (FCS), their PMs contained high levels of accessible cholesterol that were readily detected by ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A &amp; 1B</xref>, <italic>lane 1 of top panels</italic>). When these cells were incubated with 25HC for increasing times, ALOD4 binding declined sharply after 1 hour and was eliminated after 4 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>). When treated with increasing concentrations of 25HC, ALOD4 binding was sharply reduced after treatment with 1 μM 25HC and eliminated when 25HC exceeded 2.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>). Thus, treatment of CHO-K1 cells with 25HC rapidly depleted accessible cholesterol from PMs in a dose-dependent manner, as observed previously in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next asked whether 25HC was unique among oxysterols in triggering such rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol. To address this question, we assayed a panel of structurally diverse oxysterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) harboring hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus (<italic>A</italic> – <italic>C</italic>) or the iso-octyl side-chain (<italic>D</italic> – <italic>J</italic>), as well as an oxysterol where the 3ß-hydroxyl was replaced with a sulfate group <italic>(K)</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, ALOD4 binding to the PMs of CHO-K1 cells was markedly reduced by treatment for 4 hours with 25HC <italic>(I),</italic> as well as oxysterols harboring hydroxyl groups at carbons 20 (<italic>D</italic>) or 27 (<italic>J</italic>). Oxysterols with hydroxyl groups at carbon 24 (<italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>) partially reduced ALOD4 binding, whereas oxysterols with hydroxyl groups on carbon 22 (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>F</italic>) had no effect. These data indicate that the location of the hydroxyl modification on the sterol sidechain plays a crucial role in controlling accessible PM cholesterol. Moreover, the ability of a sidechain oxysterol like 25HC (<italic>I</italic>) to reduce ALOD4 binding required the 3ß-hydroxyl group since replacement of this group with a sulfate group <italic>(K)</italic> abolished this effect. No reduction of ALOD4 binding was detected with oxysterols bearing hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus at carbons 4 <italic>(A),</italic> 7 <italic>(B),</italic> or 19 (<italic>C</italic>). While oxysterols <italic>D, G, H, I,</italic> and <italic>J</italic> reduced ALOD4 binding in an all-or- none fashion, they had no detectable effect on the binding of Ostreolysin A (OlyA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), a sensor for the SM-sequestered pool of PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In line with the immunoblot analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D &amp; E</xref>, microscopy imaging with fluorescent versions of ALOD4 (fALOD4-Neon) and OlyA (fOlyA-647) also showed that oxysterols <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> eliminated accessible cholesterol, but not SM-sequestered cholesterol, from the PMs of CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We followed up with dose curve analysis of the effect of each oxysterol on ALOD4 binding. At the highest concentrations tested, oxysterols <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> reduced ALOD4 binding by more than 65%, whereas treatment with oxysterols <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>E, F,</italic> or <italic>K</italic> showed no such reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Detailed time course analyses for the five oxysterols that markedly reduced ALOD4 binding (<italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic>) showed that oxysterols <italic>D</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> reduced binding by more than 50% within 1 hour, whereas oxysterols <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic> required 4 hours for a similar reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). Together, these data indicate that selective depletion of accessible PM cholesterol within 4 hours is triggered by oxysterols harboring hydroxyl groups on the iso-octyl side chain at carbons 20, 24, 25, or 27.</p><p id="P13">To support our interpretation that the reduction of ALOD4 binding by certain oxysterols indicated depletion of accessible PM cholesterol, we carried out flow cytometry analysis of fALOD4-Neon binding to rabbit red blood cells (RBCs), which have an outer limiting membrane with high levels of accessible cholesterol but no internal membranes or mechanisms to synthesize, modify, or internalize cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>, We observed no reduction in fALOD4-Neon binding to RBCs that were treated for 4 hours with the panel of oxysterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas binding was abolished by treatment with hydroxypropyl ß-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a reagent that extracts cholesterol from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). These results suggest that reduction of ALOD4 binding to the PMs of CHO-K1 cells by oxysterols <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> is not due to effects on the lipid bilayer or on ALOD4, but rather due to their effects on cholesterol homeostatic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stimulation of ACAT activity triggers rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs</title><p id="P14">Oxysterols lower cellular cholesterol by targeting multiple cholesterol homeostatic systems, including ACAT, SREBPs, and LXRs. Having established which oxysterols rapidly deplete accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), we sought to determine if one or more of these cholesterol homeostatic systems are regulated by the same oxysterols. We first tested the oxysterol specificity for activation of ACAT’s enzymatic activity using a well-established cellular assay that measures ACAT’s ability to attach [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate, a radiolabeled fatty acid, to cholesterol to generate cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In the absence of oxysterol treatment, ACAT activity in CHO-K1 cells was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <italic>column 1</italic>). Oxysterols <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> stimulated a more than six-fold increase in ACAT activity, whereas oxysterols <italic>A, B, C, E, F,</italic> and <italic>K</italic> did not show a similar stimulatory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This specificity for activation of ACAT exactly matched that for the depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We then assessed the oxysterol specificity for inactivation of SREBPs with an assay that we routinely use to monitor the status of SREBP2, one of the three isoforms of SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In this experiment, CHO-K1 cells were first depleted of cholesterol by treatment with HPCD, which triggered the conversion of SREBP2 from its inactive precursor form (<italic>P</italic>) to its active cleaved nuclear form (N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <italic>lane 1</italic>). When the cholesterol-depleted cells were then treated with each of the oxysterols for 4 hours, we observed that oxysterols <italic>B</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>J</italic>, and <italic>K</italic> suppressed SREBP2 cleavage whereas oxysterols <italic>A</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, and <italic>F</italic> had a reduced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <italic>lanes 2-12</italic>). This specificity profile did not match that for depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">summary table in Figure 1H</xref>). In particular, oxysterols <italic>B</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>K</italic> suppressed SREBP2 cleavage but were unable to reduce ALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that SREBP2 suppression does not drive the rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs.</p><p id="P16">Lastly, we evaluated the extensive previous literature that has addressed the oxysterol specificity for activating LXR transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). These studies showed that oxysterols <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> activate LXRs whereas oxysterols <italic>F</italic> and <italic>K</italic> had no such activating effect (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">summary table in Figure 1H</xref>). Similar to results with SREBP2, the oxysterol specificity for LXR activation also did not match that for reduction in ALOD4 binding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Disruption of ACAT activity abolishes the ability of oxysterols to rapidly deplete accessible cholesterol from PMs</title><p id="P17">The above oxysterol specificity analysis suggested that ACAT, but not SREBPs or LXRs, triggers the rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, we generated a CHO-K1 cell line that lacks ACAT enzymatic activity. Mammalian cells contain two isoforms of ACAT, ACAT1 and ACAT2, however previous studies of CHO cells have shown that ~99% of their ACAT activity arises from the ACAT1 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the ACAT 1 gene in CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). The resulting ACAT1-deficient cells, hereafter designated as ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, had undetectable levels of ACAT1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Moreover, ACAT enzymatic activity, as judged by cholesteryl[<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation, was stimulated by 25HC, one of the five oxysterols that triggered ACAT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), to an expected degree in wild-type (WT) cells but not in ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>, <italic>first two groups</italic>), further indicating that the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells lacked ACAT activity. To ensure that these results were due to loss of ACAT activity, we stably expressed either wild-type human ACAT1 or a mutant version harboring a point mutation (H460A) that abolishes ACAT 1’s enzymatic activity in ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and the resulting cell lines were designated as ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup>; hACAT1(WT) and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup>; hACAT1(H460A), respectively. Compared to the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, these two new cell lines contained high levels of ACAT1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of ACAT enzymatic activity by 25HC was restored by the stable expression of hACAT 1 (WT), but not hACAT 1 (H460A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>, <italic>last two groups</italic>). Thus, these four cell lines provide a framework to study the specific role of ACAT activity in determining accessible cholesterol levels in PMs.</p><p id="P18">We then measured the effects of 25HC on accessible cholesterol cholesterol in the PMs of these four cell lines. As expected, treatment of WT cells with 25HC for 4 hours depleted PM accessible cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lanes 1 – 6, first panel</italic>). In contrast, no such depletion was observed in ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lanes 1 – 6, third panel</italic>). Restoration of ACAT activity by stable expression of hACAT1(WT) reestablished the ability of 25HC to deplete accessible PM cholesterol, whereas 25HC had no effect in cells stably expressing an inactive mutant of hACAT1 (H460A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lanes 1 – 6, fifth and seventh panels</italic>). When each of these four cell lines were depleted of sterols and then treated with 25HC, we observed similar dose dependences for suppression of SREBP2 processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that 25HC entered the cells and reached their ER membranes to bind Insigs and prevent SREBP2 transport. Thus, the inability of 25HC to deplete accessible PM cholesterol in ACAT 1<sup>-/-</sup> cells is not simply due to a defect in cellular entry of 25HC. In all four cell lines, 4HC did not diminish PM accessible cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lane 7, all panels</italic>), consistent with this oxysterol’s inability to stimulate ACAT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, oxysterol A</xref>). Similar to the results with 25HC, the 4 other oxysterols that depleted accessible PM cholesterol in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, oxysterols D, G, H, and J</xref>) were also unable to do so in the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, further underscoring the link between ACAT and accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We also used fluorescence microscopy to analyze the effects of 25HC on the distribution of accessible and SM-sequestered pools of cholesterol in these cell lines. Consistent with immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observed that 25HC treatment for 4 hours eliminated binding of fALOD4-Neon to WT cells, and this effect was abolished in ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>top two rows</italic>). Likewise, expression of hACAT1(WT), but not hACAT1(H460A), in the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells restored 25HC’s ability to deplete fALOD4-Neon binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>third and fourth rows</italic>).In all four cell lines, binding of fOlyA-647 was unchanged by 25HC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), further highlighting that over a period of 4 hours, 25HC specifically depletes the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in an ACAT-mediated manner.</p><p id="P20">To confirm that ACAT is the primary target of 25HC for rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol, we examined two previously described cell lines, one lacking all three isoforms of SREBPs (owing to a deficiency of Scap, which stabilizes SREBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and the other lacking both isoforms of LXRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).

Also, levels of SM-sequestered cholesterol in these cells were unchanged after treatment with either 25HC or 4HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D, right panels, lanes 1 – 7</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Combined, the above sets of studies show that the rapid (1–4 hours) removal of accessible cholesterol from PMs by 25HC is due to its activation of ACAT and not due to its modulation of the SREBP or LXR pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A model for rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs by ER-localized ACAT</title><p id="P22">The concentration of cholesterol in the PM (~40-50 mole% of total lipids) is almost 10-fold higher than that in the ER membrane (~5 mole% of total lipids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). How then can activation of ACAT, a cholesterol-modifying enzyme in the ER membrane, rapidly alter the levels of the accessible cholesterol pool in the PM? Previous studies have suggested that even though the total cholesterol concentrations in the PM and ER are quite different, the concentration of accessible cholesterol in the two membranes may be similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). The equivalence in accessible cholesterol levels between the PM and ER is maintained by rapid bi-directional transport of cholesterol between the two membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Based on these previous insights, we propose that ACAT activation, and the resulting production of cholesteryl esters, would siphon off some of the accessible cholesterol from the ER, thus lowering levels of accessible cholesterol in the ER relative to the PM. Cholesterol transport from the PM to the ER would then rapidly restore the equivalence of accessible cholesterol between the two membranes. As a result, levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM would decline.</p><p id="P23">The above model provides a possible explanation for how ACAT activation by 25HC would lead to a depletion of accessible PM cholesterol in WT cells, but not in ACAT1 <sup>-/</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We further tested this model by activating ACAT not by 25HC but by lipoproteins, which have been shown to generate high ACAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We then took advantage of the sensitivity of flow cytometry analysis to assess levels of accessible and SM-sequestered cholesterol in the PMs of WT and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells with fluorescent versions of ALOD4 and OlyA, respectively. When cells are grown under low cholesterol conditions (lipoprotein-deficient serum, LPDS), ACAT activity is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Under these conditions, both WT and ACAT1 <sup>-/-</sup> cells had the same low levels of accessible and SM-sequestered cholesterol in their PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). By comparison, when cells are grown under high cholesterol conditions (FCS), ACAT activity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In this case, the PMs of ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells had significantly higher levels of accessible cholesterol as compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result is consistent with the model proposed above since the ACAT1”<sup>/-</sup> cells, unlike the WT cells, are unable to siphon away ER cholesterol, leading to higher levels of accessible cholesterol in the PMs of these cells. Importantly, there was no difference in levels of SM-sequestered cholesterol in the PMs of WT and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), highlighting the specific effect of the ACAT pathway on accessible PM cholesterol.</p><p id="P24">An assumption of our model is that rapid bi-directional transport of accessible cholesterol between the PM and the ER was not disrupted in ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. To test this notion, we carried out three different experiments in which the cholesterol content of the PM was varied and changes in ER cholesterol were monitored by assessing the molecular size of SREBP2, which is processed from its precursor form (<italic>P</italic>) to a cleaved nuclear form (<italic>N</italic>) in response to decreases in ER cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). First, we depleted cholesterol from the PMs of FCS-treated cells by incubation with HPCD, which extracts cholesterol from PMs. The reduction in PM cholesterol is rapidly compensated for by drawing cholesterol from the ER, leading to a reduction in ER cholesterol levels and an increase in SREBP2 cleavage. In both WT and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, HPCD treatment reduced ER cholesterol levels with similar time dependences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the pathways that transport cholesterol from ER to PM are not affected in the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</p><p id="P25">Second, we depleted both cell lines of cholesterol by incubation overnight in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient serum along with compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). This treatment lowered ER cholesterol to a similar degree in both cell lines, as judged by similar levels of nuclear SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>lane 1, first and third panels</italic>). We then added back increasing concentrations of lipoprotein-rich FCS and observed a similar dose-dependent increase in ER cholesterol in both cell lines, as judged by reduction of nuclear SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>lanes 2 - 7</italic>). Third, we depleted cells of cholesterol by treatment with HPCD and then added back increasing concentrations of complexes of cholesterol with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (MCD), which deliver cholesterol to the PMs. Analysis of SREBP2 cleavage in both cell lines showed similar reduction in ER cholesterol levels upon depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>lane 1, first and third panels</italic>), and a similar dose-dependent increase in ER cholesterol levels upon replenishment with cholesterol/MCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>lanes 2 - 6</italic>). The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D and 3E</xref> suggest that the pathways transporting lipoprotein-derived or exogenously added cholesterol from PM to ER are not affected in the ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</p><p id="P26">Taken together, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> provide a plausible mechanism for how 25HC and other ACAT-activating oxysterols could rapidly alter the levels of accessible cholesterol in the PMs of cells whose overall cholesterol content varies over a wide range.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>25HC-triggered depletion of accessible PM cholesterol persists long after 25HC removal through suppression of SREBPs</title><p id="P27">We next wondered whether the rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol after a short exposure to 25HC would be sustained over longer periods. To explore this possibility, we first treated CHO-K1 cells with 25HC for a short period of 4 hours, which depleted accessible cholesterol from the PMs in an expected manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>first panel, lanes 1, 2</italic>). We then removed the 25HC and examined accessible PM cholesterol levels over time. Despite the lack of 25HC in the extracellular media and cells being grown in cholesterol-rich FCS, we detected no replenishment of accessible PM cholesterol even after 22 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>first panel, lanes 3 - 8</italic>). In line with our model of equivalence of accessible cholesterol levels in the PM and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), we expected that ER accessible cholesterol levels would also be low 22 hours after 25HC removal, which would be reflected in increased cleavage of SREBP2 to its nuclear form. Surprisingly, we detected no processing of SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>third panel</italic>). Mass spectrometric analysis of intracellular 25HC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>) showed that 25HC was barely detectable (~0.015 ng/μg of cellular protein) in untreated cells (<italic>lane 1</italic>) and rose to 4 ng/μg of cellular protein after 25HC treatment for 4 hours (<italic>lane 2</italic>). After removal of 25HC from the extracellular medium, the intracellular 25HC declined over the time course of 22 hours to 0.35 ng/μg of cellular protein (<italic>lanes 3 - 8</italic>), a level that was 23-times higher than that in untreated cells and sufficient to suppress SREBP2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>lane 8</italic>).</p><p id="P28">In contrast to the sustained action of 25HC, when accessible PM cholesterol was depleted by treatment with HPCD (1 hour), its levels were replenished within 4 hours of HPCD removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>first panel</italic>). Moreover, HPCD depletion triggered SREBP2 cleavage in an expected fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>second panel, lanes 1, 2</italic>), and this cleavage was suppressed at the same time as an increase in PM accessible cholesterol was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>second panel, lanes 3 – 8</italic>). These data further support the notion that 25HC’s long-term effects arise due to its suppression of SREBP cleavage. If this was the case, we would expect 25HC’s effects to be overcome by expression of the cleaved nuclear forms of SREBPs. We tested this possibility in previously developed cell lines where expression of the cleaved nuclear forms of each of the three isoforms of SREBPs – SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2 – can be induced by addition of the small molecule muristerone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). In the absence of muristerone, these cells had detectable levels of accessible cholesterol in their PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>lane 1</italic>). 25HC treatment depleted this pool and no replenishment was observed 22 hours after the 25HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>lanes 2, 3</italic>). We then treated the cells with muristerone to induce the expression of the nuclear forms of each of the three SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>lanes 4 – 6</italic>). Under these conditions, the accessible cholesterol in the PMs of these cells was also depleted by 25HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>lanes 4, 5</italic>). However, when the 25HC was removed, we now detected replenishment of accessible cholesterol on the PMs of cells expressing the nuclear forms of SREBP1a and SREBP2, but not SREBP1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>lane 6</italic>). This isoform specificity for restoring accessible PM cholesterol is consistent with the previous observation that the nuclear forms of SREBP1a and SREBP2, but not SREBP1c, increase cholesterol synthesis and induce expression of the LDL receptor allowing for uptake of cholesterol from the LDL in FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Based on these data, we hypothesized that 25HC acts through two distinct, temporally resolved stages. First, a short pulse of 25HC activates ACAT, which siphons away ER cholesterol resulting in rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM. Second, 25HC suppresses SREBP-mediated uptake and synthesis of cholesterol, resulting in sustained depletion of accessible cholesterol in the PM. We next asked whether initial ACAT activation was required for depletion of accessible cholesterol over long time periods, or whether this could be achieved simply through sustained SREBP inhibition by residual 25HC? To answer this question, we compared the responses of WT and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup> cells to depletion of accessible PM cholesterol. As expected, HPCD treatment (1 hour) induced the depletion of accessible PM cholesterol in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>lanes 1, 2</italic>), and this depletion was fully reversed 22 hours after HPCD removal (<italic>lane 3</italic>), indicating that this mode of cholesterol depletion occurred independently of ACAT activity. A different result was observed after 25HC treatment for 4 hours. In WT cells, 25HC depleted the accessible cholesterol as expected and no replenishment was observed after the 25HC was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>first panel, lanes 4, 5</italic>). However, in ACAT1 <italic>’</italic> cells, 25HC did not deplete accessible PM cholesterol and there was no further change after the 25HC was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>third panel, lanes 4, 5</italic>). Thus, without the initial action of 25HC on ACAT, the lingering intracellular 25HC that inhibits new cholesterol synthesis and uptake through suppressing SREBP activation is not enough to reduce accessible PM cholesterol, even after 22 hours.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>ACAT activation by 25HC protects cells from pore formation by bacterial cytolysins</title><p id="P30">Having determined how ACAT-activating oxysterols trigger both rapid and sustained depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM, we next sought to determine if these mechanisms are responsible for the previously reported immunological effects of 25HC.

The model builds on recent observations that bacteria and viruses exploit a small pool of cholesterol in the host cell’s PM, termed accessible cholesterol, to promote infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We show that 25HC manipulates pathways normally used to maintain cholesterol homeostasis to i) rapidly deplete accessible PM cholesterol; and ii) maintain this depleted state over an extended period of time to deliver long-lasting protection against bacterial and viral infection.</p><p id="P39">A striking feature of 25HC is its ability to act within 30 - 60 minutes to deplete accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that 25HC swiftly depletes accessible PM cholesterol primarily through stimulation of ACAT’s enzymatic activity, and not through its effects on LXR and SREBP transcriptional pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Since ACAT resides in the ER, we were surprised that its activation could rapidly deplete accessible cholesterol from the membrane of a different organelle, the PM. Our studies suggest that such depletion occurs by exploiting the rapid transport pathways that normally move cholesterol between the PM and ER to maintain an equivalence of accessible cholesterol between the two membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Activation of ACAT siphons off some of the ER accessible cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters, which results in an imbalance in accessible cholesterol levels between the PM and the ER. The rapid movement of cholesterol between the two membranes swiftly rectifies this imbalance and leads to a net lower level of accessible cholesterol in both membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, 25HC exploits existing cholesterol homeostatic features to rapidly deplete accessible PM cholesterol. In line with this model, a prescient earlier study showed that 25HC activation of ACAT in macrophages reduces a pool of PM cholesterol that is accessible for modification by the enzyme cholesterol oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>).</p><p id="P40">A potentially confounding observation is that stimulation of mouse macrophage TLRs by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) increases CH25H expression only for a short period of time (~4 hours), after which CH25H expression declines down to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). How then could short-lived production of 25HC protect cells from bacterial and viral infections that occur over much longer time periods? Remarkably, we found that in cells exposed to 25HC for short periods of time (4 hours), accessible PM cholesterol levels remained low even after 22 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This result was surprising since one would expect that depletion of accessible PM cholesterol would also deplete accessible cholesterol in the ER, leading to upregulation of SREBP transcription factors that would increase cholesterol synthesis and uptake and replenish accessible PM cholesterol. Indeed, such replenishment is observed when accessible PM cholesterol is depleted by treatment with HPCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, after cells were exposed to 25HC for 4 hours, the residual amounts of 25HC that remained in the cells was sufficient to maintain SREBPs in their inactive state over an extended period of 22 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, 25HC achieves both rapid and long-lasting depletion of accessible PM cholesterol through its concerted effects on ACAT and SREBPs. Although the panel of oxysterols studied here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) is by no means an exhaustive list, it is worth noting that the four other oxysterols that deplete accessible cholesterol from PMs through stimulation of ACAT activity (20αHC, 24(<italic>P</italic>)HC, 24(<italic>S</italic>)HC, and 27HC) also suppress the activation of SREBP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). It is attractive to speculate that these other oxysterols may also regulate accessible PM cholesterol in other biological contexts.</p><p id="P41">The model we propose for 25HC’s anti-bacterial and anti-viral functions is dependent on ACAT activation as the initiator of rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol. In the absence of ACAT activity, 25HC loses the ability to protect cells from lysis by cytolysins secreted by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), and infection by Zika virus and coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In mammalian cells, ACAT activity arises from two isoforms - ACAT1 and ACAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). While ACAT activity can be completely abolished in cultured cells through CRISPR-mediated deletion of either or both isoforms of ACAT, an animal knockout of both isoforms of ACAT is not currently available. However, 25HC’s ability to protect against infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> was completely lost in ACAT1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further studies are needed to identify the cell types targeted by 25HC since the ACAT1-deficient mice lost ACAT activity in peritoneal macrophages and adrenal tissue, but not in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>).</p><p id="P42">An outstanding question that has yet to be answered is how pathogens exploit accessible PM cholesterol for infection and how 25HC-mediated loss of accessible PM cholesterol provides immune protection. In the case of cytolysins such as Perfringolysin O and Anthrolysin O that bind accessible cholesterol on the outer PM leaflet, oligomerize, and form lytic pores, it is plausible that depletion of accessible PM cholesterol would confer protection by preventing cytolysin binding. However, how depletion of accessible PM cholesterol protects against intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or viruses remains largely unknown. We suspect that accessible PM cholesterol regulates the activities of one or more protein receptors involved in these processes, as has been shown for proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). It is worth noting that cholesterol has been implicated in the regulation of several immune receptor signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). Thus, the principles and tools described in the current study promise to aid in uncovering the mechanisms by which accessible PM cholesterol is exploited by pathogens and is mobilized by the host immune system through 25HC and other functionally related oxysterols.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Experimental Model Details</title><sec id="S13"><title>Mice</title><p id="P43">All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Approval Reference Number: APN102346).

As controls for hemolysis, RBCs (500 μl) were incubated with 1% (v/v) Triton-X100 for 4 h. After incubations, aliquots of the binding assays were transferred to new tubes. One aliquot (200 μl) was transferred to a tube containing 5 μl of a stock solution of fALOD4-Neon (final concentration of 1 μM) and incubated at RT for 30 min. A portion of this mixture (150 μl) was then transferred to a 96-well plate and fALOD4-Neon binding was measured by analyzing 10,000 RBCs for each condition on a Stratedigm S1000 EX Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescently labeled RBCs were analyzed using FlowJo software version 10 (Ashland, OR) and geometric mean fluorescent intensity (gMFI) of each population was calculated to quantify fALOD4-Neon binding. The other aliquot (250 μl) was subjected to centrifugation (350 x g for 15 min at 20°C) and a portion of the supernatant (125 μl) was transferred to 96-well plates.
