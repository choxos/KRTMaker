Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1) is a key regulator of chromatin replication, but how CAF-1 cooperates with the DNA replication machinery is unknown. Here, we reveal that this crosstalk differs between the leading and lagging strand at replication forks. Using biochemical reconstitution, we show that DNA and histones promote CAF-1 recruitment to its binding partner PCNA and reveal that two CAF-1 complexes are required for efficient nucleosome assembly under these conditions. Remarkably, in the context of the replisome, CAF-1 competes with the leading strand DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) for PCNA binding, but not with the lagging strand DNA polymerase Delta (Polδ). Yet, in cells, CAF-1 deposits newly synthesized histones equally on both daughter strands. Thus, on the leading strand, chromatin assembly by CAF-1 cannot occur simultaneously to DNA synthesis, while on the lagging strand both processes are coupled. We propose that these differences may facilitate distinct parental histone recycling mechanisms and accommodate the inherent asymmetry of DNA replication.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">During every cell cycle, a new copy of the genome is made. At the same time, genomic chromatin organization must be replicated to ensure faithful transmission of the parental epigenetic state to both daughter cells after cell division. Therefore, genome and chromatin replication are tightly coupled and regulated by the concerted action of several dozens of proteins. Errors in both processes affect cell function; they can derail developmental programs or cause diseases, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">DNA is replicated by the replisome, which is comprised of a core Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase complex, DNA polymerases and regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Two distinct DNA polymerases function on the two daughter strands: DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) acts on the leading strand, whereas DNA polymerase delta (Polδ) acts on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Because both DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in the 5’-3’ direction, the two strands are replicated via distinct mechanisms. Polε tightly binds the CMG and continuously extends the leading strand, while Polδ discontinuously synthesizes short Okazaki fragments, which are later processed and ligated on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Despite their mechanistic differences, both DNA polymerases require the processivity factor <underline>P</underline>roliferating <underline>C</underline>ell <underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>A</underline>ntigen (PCNA) for their function. PCNA is an essential homotrimeric clamp that encircles newly synthesized double-stranded DNA, tethering the DNA polymerases to DNA. It is abundant at replication forks where, in addition to the DNA polymerases, it binds many other factors involved in genome replication, chromatin assembly and the response to stress and damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Chromatin replication requires proteins that function as histone chaperones, which include replisome components with histone binding properties (i.e. MCM2, Polε, Polα and RPA) and <italic>bona fide</italic> histone chaperones that are recruited to the replisome (i.e. FACT, CAF-1 and ASF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These proteins coordinate the recycling of parental histones to spatially maintain the landscape of histone post-translational modifications. They also promote the incorporation of newly synthesized histones to preserve nucleosome density on the daughter DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Replicated DNA is readily assembled into chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), a process that constitutes the first critical step to the re-establishment of epigenetic modifications on histones genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1) is a key regulator of chromatin assembly during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). CAF-1 deletion is lethal during vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), and transient CAF-1 depletion affects cell cycle progression and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). CAF-1 forms a heterotrimeric complex consisting of Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3 in yeast and p150, p60 and p48 in mammals. The complex chaperones newly synthesized histones H3-H4 and deposits them onto DNA at sites of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). CAF-1 activity at replication forks depends on its interaction with PCNA, which occurs via canonical <underline>P</underline>CNA <underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>P</underline>eptides (PIPs) present on the large CAF-1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). While the function of CAF-1 has been studied in cells and in the SV40 systems, a detailed bottom-up biochemical reconstitution to address the molecular mechanism by which CAF-1 assembles chromatin during DNA replication and its interplays with the replisome is still lacking.</p><p id="P7">Here we developed biochemical systems to study the crosstalk between CAF-1 and key components of the DNA replication machinery, combining our previous CAF-1 histone chaperone assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) with primer extension assays and the recent <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitutions of the eukaryotic replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We find that CAF-1 recruitment to PCNA requires DNA and is modulated by histones. Two CAF-1 complexes bind PCNA and are necessary for PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly. CAF-1 interaction with PCNA inhibits the activity of the leading-strand DNA polymerase Polε, but not of the lagging-strand polymerase Polδ. Yet, in cells, we show that CAF-1 deposits histones equally on the leading and lagging strands during DNA replication. Thus, our work reveals an unexpected difference in the crosstalk between CAF-1, PCNA and the two replicative polymerases, indicating different mechanisms for the coupling of nucleosome assembly to DNA synthesis on the two daughter strands.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>ResultS</title><sec id="S3"><title>CAF-1 recruitment to PCNA requires DNA</title><p id="P8">We first set out to study the interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA in the context of DNA, as this is the context in which the CAF-1-PCNA interaction occur during DNA replication. Therefore, we loaded PCNA onto nicked plasmids using the ATP-dependent clamp loader RFC1-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>), and separated DNA-loaded from free PCNA on a size exclusion column (SEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). When adding CAF-1, we observed that the three CAF-1 subunits co-eluted with DNA-loaded PCNA, suggesting the formation of a CAF-1-PCNA-plasmid complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B-C</xref>). As CAF-1 uses PIPs to bind PCNA in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), we introduced mutations in these domains to test their importance in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). The mutant CAF-1_PIP** no longer bound to DNA-loaded PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>), confirming that our <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution recapitulates the physiological determinants of the CAF-1-PCNA interaction.</p><p id="P9">Next, we investigated how DNA contributes to the CAF-1-PCNA interaction. CAF-1 did not co-elute with PCNA in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>) or when PCNA was not loaded onto DNA (i.e. by omission of ATP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>), suggesting that DNA is required for the CAF-1-PCNA interaction. To confirm that the interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA is DNA-dependent, we crosslinked CAF-1 to fluorescently labeled PCNA on nicked DNA plasmids using glutaraldehyde in the presence or absence of ATP, followed by nuclease digestion and SDS-PAGE analysis to determine if more transient protein-protein complexes are formed in solution, which may be lost during the SEC purification. Again, we observed no significant CAF-1-PCNA complexes when PCNA was not loaded onto DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that DNA is required for a stable interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA.</p><p id="P10">CAF-1 contains two DNA binding regions in its large Cac1 subunit: the Lys-Glu-Arg rich (or KER) region located at the N-terminus, which is flanked by the PIPs, and the winged-helix domain (WHD) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). Either domain is required for CAF-1 function in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), but their relative role in CAF-1 mechanism remains unclear, as both domains must be mutated simultaneously in order to disrupt CAF-1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We thus tested whether these domains contributed to the DNA-dependent interaction of CAF-1 to PCNA. Deletion of the KER domain or its mutation into a neutral unstructured sequence (CAF-1_ΔKER and CAF-1_KER*, respectively) abrogated the interaction between CAF-1 and DNA-loaded PCNA, similarly to the effect of the CAF-1_PIP** mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>). However, mutations in the WHD (CAF-1_WHD*) had no effect on binding to DNA-loaded PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that the CAF-1 KER domain, but not the WHD, is critical for the formation of a stable CAF-1-PCNA complex on DNA.</p><p id="P11">Having established that DNA is required for the CAF-1-PCNA interaction, we investigated whether there is a minimum DNA length required to promote this interaction. We first confirm that CAF-1 binds 10-fold more weakly to a 18 bp DNA (Kd &gt; 2 μM) than to a 33, 43 or 53 bp DNA (Kd = 0,33, 0,23 and 0,18 μM respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1G</xref>), in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). Mutations in the KER domain strongly inhibit the CAF-1-DNA interaction, while WHD mutations have a minor effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1H</xref>). Complex formation was less efficient on the 18 bp DNA fragment, where PCNA can load in the absence of RFC, than on the longer 43 and 53 bp DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1I</xref>). This suggests that a minimum of ±30 bp need to be exposed for CAF-1 to stably bind PCNA on DNA. Notably, the Alphafold model of the Cac1-KER domain (residues 128-226) predicts a long helical structure of <sup>~</sup>145 Å, which corresponds to the length of <sup>~</sup>44 bp of duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1J</xref>). This domain displays a positively charged surface along its helical arrangement, which may structurally explain the link we observe between DNA length and CAF-1 binding, assuming that this surface interacts with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the DNA via electrostatic interactions. Overall, these observations suggest that the CAF-1-PCNA interaction on DNA is stabilized by DNA of at least <sup>~</sup>30 bp via the KER domain in CAF-1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reconstitution of PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly by CAF-1</title><p id="P12">In cells, PCNA directs CAF-1-mediated chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). However, we and others have recently shown that CAF-1 is able to assemble nucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). To determine how the presence of PCNA affects the histone chaperone activity of CAF-1, we set out to develop a nucleosome assembly assay that recapitulates the PCNA dependency of CAF-1 activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The challenge is to differentiate between PCNA-dependent and PCNA-independent (i.e. purely DNA driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>)) activity of CAF-1. To overcome this challenge, we mixed the nicked plasmid where PCNA can be loaded, with a competitor supercoiled plasmid where PCNA-independent reactions take place. Following a PCNA loading step, we added CAF-1-H3-H4 complexes to promote tetramer deposition followed by the addition of fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B, which associate with tetrasomes <italic>in vitro</italic> to form nucleosomes. Fluorescence-based readouts on native gels combined with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion are used to measure nucleosome assembly on each of the plasmids. We named this setup PCNA-NAQ assay, based on our previously established <underline>N</underline>ucleosome <underline>A</underline>ssembly and <underline>Q</underline>uantitation (NAQ) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We first established that the PCNA-NAQ assay measures PCNA-dependent and -independent CAF-1 activity. Efficient nucleosome assembly (monitored by an increase in H2B fluorescence) on the nicked plasmid was observed only when PCNA is loaded on DNA and CAF-1 is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). When PCNA loading was blocked by the omission of ATP, PCNA or RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), the histone fluorescence signal shifted to the supercoiled plasmid, confirming that the signal on the nicked plasmid is dependent on PCNA. As expected, omission of CAF-1 led to a drastic reduction of histone deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), reinforcing that CAF-1 is the nucleosome assembly machinery on both plasmids in our reconstitution. No nucleosomes were formed upon omission of either histones H3-H4 or H2A-H2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Moreover, using labeled H3-H4 instead of H2A-H2B did not affect the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), confirming that our signal is a <italic>bona fide</italic> measure of assembled nucleosomes. Quantification of the histone fluorescence signal on the nicked plasmid compared to total histone signal showed that roughly 50% of the nucleosomes are assembled in a PCNA-dependent manner, when PCNA is loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is reduced to roughly 20% when PCNA was not loaded onto DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These observations were confirmed using next generation sequencing approaches of the MNase products, when we used plasmids with distinct DNA sequences which allowed us to map relative nucleosome assembly and positioning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2C-F</xref>). Thus, we developed a new method to study the PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly function of CAF-1, where we can distinguish and quantify the PCNA-dependent or PCNA-independent activities of this histone chaperone complex.</p><p id="P14">We then used this method to understand how CAF-1 assembles nucleosomes when bound to PCNA. We first tested if mutations in the KER domain or PIPs of Cac1, which are important for recruitment to DNA-loaded PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, 1E</xref>), affected its PCNA-mediated activity. As expected, CAF-1_KER* and CAF-1_PIP** showed a reduction specifically in PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>), while the overall activity of the mutant complexes was not affected as seen by the consistent level of MNase-protected nucleosome fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>). This confirms that CAF-1 recruitment is necessary for PCNA-dependent nucleosome formation in our PCNA-NAQ assay, further validating the role of these domains in the CAF-1-PCNA interaction. Strikingly, the CAF-1_WHD* mutant also showed a decrease in PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>), despite being able to bind DNA-loaded PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) and being fully active in nucleosome assembly in absence of PCNA as shown by the MNase digestion products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>). This demonstrates that the WHD domain is important for PCNA-dependent CAF-1 activity specifically. Our observations explain why WHD mutations affect chromatin assembly during DNA replication in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), and why previous <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitutions that omitted PCNA were unable to recapitulate loss of function of this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). In summary, we show that the WHD domain in CAF-1 is important for the PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly function of the complex.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Two CAF-1 complexes bind PCNA to assemble nucleosomes</title><p id="P15">Two CAF-1 complexes are required to assemble one nucleosome in the absence of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). To understand how CAF-1 assembles nucleosomes when bound to PCNA, we therefore set out to study the stoichiometry of the CAF-1-PCNA complex on DNA. To this end, we used protein-protein crosslinking followed by nuclease digestion and SEC to analyze complexes in solution. These reactions elute with two peaks of equal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We collected fractions from these peaks and analyzed them by mass photometry to determine their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). We found that Peak1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) contained CAF-1-PCNA complexes corresponding to predominantly two CAF-1 per PCNA trimer (<sup>~</sup>430 kDa), and a lower amount of three CAF-1 per PCNA trimer (<sup>~</sup>590 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), while Peak2 contained mostly free unbound CAF-1 (<sup>~</sup>190 kDa) and a small fraction of complexes containing one CAF-1 per PCNA trimer (<sup>~</sup>285 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data indicate that the CAF-1-PCNA complex mainly assembles in a 2:1 (CAF-1 to PCNA trimer) stoichiometry on DNA, and to a lesser extent, can form 3:1 or 1:1 assemblies.</p><p id="P16">To further evaluate the stoichiometry of CAF-1-PCNA-DNA complexes, we monitored complex formation using crosslinking at limiting concentrations of fluorescently labeled PCNA loaded onto DNA, which also allows us to estimate binding affinities. Without CAF-1, PCNA crosslinks with the clamp loader RFC (calculated molecular weight is 310 kDa) to form a complex that runs at the same height as 2xCAF-1-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). This band increases in intensity as we increase CAF-1 concentration above 100 nM while RFC is kept constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Interestingly, above 350 nM, we observed that 3xCAF-1-PCNA complexes formed while the 2xCAF-1-PCNA band became less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>).

Together, these experiments demonstrate that CAF-1 prefers to bind PCNA on DNA with a 2:1 stoichiometry at concentrations around 100 nM. Above 350 nM, additional CAF-1 complexes can associate with DNA-loaded PCNA. Interestingly, only a very small fraction of CAF-1-PCNA complexes at a 1:1 stoichiometry is observed. This is in line with our previous hypothesis that two CAF-1 complexes cooperatively associate on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>), and it shows that it also applies to PCNA-dependent CAF-1 chromatin assembly.</p><p id="P17">To ask if this assembly is important for CAF-1 histone chaperone function, we tested if mutations in the WHD domain affected the stoichiometry of CAF-1-PCNA complexes.

Thus, we set out to investigate if histones affect CAF-1 binding to PCNA. To this end, we investigated the role of histones on the CAF-1-PCNA interaction in the absence of DNA, because in DNA-containing reactions histones would be immediately deposited onto DNA, making it impossible to assess their effect on the CAF-1-PCNA interaction. As shown above, CAF-1 does not bind to PCNA when DNA is missing from the reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>). However, pre-incubation of CAF-1 with H3-H4 promotes the interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA in the absence of DNA in crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Deletion of the N-terminal region in Cac1, which contains the PIPs and KER domain (as in the truncated tCAF-1 construct, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>), prevents the CAF-1-PCNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), confirming that this region is responsible for binding to PCNA within the complex.

We found that adding CAF-1 had minimal effects on DNA synthesis by Polδ in this primer extension assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, CAF-1 had a strong inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis by Polε, at concentrations of 150 nM where CAF-1 binds PCNA with a 2:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This effect resolved at later time points and was dose-dependent, indicative of competitive inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). This suggests a dynamic and steric effect of CAF-1 on Polε-mediated DNA synthesis. To test if this inhibition involved a crosstalk on PCNA, we used CAF-1 mutants that do not bind to DNA-loaded PCNA (i.e. CAF-1_PIP** and CAF-1_KER*). These mutants did not inhibit Polε activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4CD</xref>), demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of CAF-1 on Polε is exerted via PCNA.

We found that CAF-1 binds PCNA on DNA with intermediate binding affinity (<sup>~</sup>100 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>).

While inhibiting Polε even more strongly than WT CAF-1, this mutant still had only a minor effect on Polδ activity when added at 300 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). Therefore, differences in PCNA binding affinities between the two polymerases do not solely explain the differences in their crosstalk to CAF-1, suggesting that steric effects might play a role.

To this end, we combined primer extension reactions with NAQ-based readouts to measure histone deposition (i.e. nucleosome assembly). Because in this assay the substrate is RPA-coated single-stranded DNA, nucleosome formation occurs only after DNA synthesis. In the absence of CAF-1, Polε containing reactions show background levels of nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). These levels are even lower than the histone deposition that we observe with Polδ, which we used as a negative control because it can synthesize DNA but does not bind histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Both reactions contain RPA, indicating that this complex also does not stimulate nucleosome assembly. However, the addition of CAF-1 strongly increases nucleosome assembly in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Cells were passaged using Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) or TrypLE (Gibco). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For genome editing <italic>Chaf1a</italic>-dTAG cells were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 using the SpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 plasmid (addgene #62988) as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>) with sgRNA#1 (Supplementary Table S5), which target the Chaf1a gene at the beginning of the ORF and a Chaf1-linker-dTAG homology donor plasmid. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) using 0.5 μg of sgRNA-plasmid and 2 μg of donor plasmid. Cells were sparsely seeded on a 10 cm dish 24 hours posttransfection and selected with Puromycin (2 μg/mL) for 48 h. Thereafter, cells were expanded and genotyped with primers #1 and #2 (Supplementary Table S5). Positive clones were analyzed by Sanger sequencing with primers #3 and #4 (Integrated DNA Technologies, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) and degradation upon dTAG-13 (Tocris, 6605) treatment was confirmed by Western Blot by a-Chaf1a antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Fractionation cell extracts were prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Western Blotting was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p id="P60">Cells treated with DMSO or dTAG-13 for 4 hours,were pulsed in EdU-containing media (10 μM) for 10 min and immediately fixed for 15 min in 4% PFA at RT and stored in PBST (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100). Primary antibody H4K20me0 was added at the concentration of 1:1000 in PBST with 5% donkey serum and incubated overnight. Incubation was followed by 3 washes in PBS and secondary antibody was then added in PBST. Samples were incubated with the secondary antibody in the dark at RT for 1h. After 3 washes, samples were stained with DAPI (1:10000) in PBST. Images were acquired with a ScanR high-content screening microscope (Olympus). Automated and unbiased image analysis was carried out with the ScanR analysis software (version 2.8.1). Individual cells were identified based on DAPI staining and mean pixel intensity was measured for each channel. Data were exported and processed using Spotfire software (version 10.5.0; Tibco). Statistical analysis and visualization of results was done using using R (v4.1.2) in RStudio (v2021.9.2.382).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>SCAR-seq</title><p id="P61">A step-by-step protocol is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Briefly, nascent SCAR-seq samples were prepared from <italic>Chaf1a</italic>-dTAG cells in three biological replicates for each histone PTM. Cells treated with DMSO or dTAG-13 for 2 hours, were pulsed in EdU-containing media (10 μM) for 30 min and harvested immediately. For sample collection, media was aspirated, plates washed 2x with RT PBS and ice-cold PBS was added to the dishes. Cells were scraped in a cold room and collected by centrifugation, followed by nuclei isolation. Nuclei were aliquoted, snap-frozen and stored at -80° C until further use. For MNase digest, nuclei were counted manually using Kova Glasstic Slides and 2 U MNase (Worthington) were added per 1x106 nuclei. Digests were performed at 30° C for 20 minutes. For native ChIP, 30-50 μg of chromatin was used per sample and incubated with antibodies in a total volume of 600 μL overnight at 4° C with H3K27me3 antibody (Cell Signaling, 9733) or H4K20me0 antibody (Abcam, ab227804). Magnetic beads (anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads, invitrogen) were added the next morning and samples were incubated for 2 hours. After three washes each with ice-cold RIPA buffer and RIPA 0.5M NaCl buffer, DNA was eluted and purified using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen). Mononucleosomal-sized fragments were isolated by double sided size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). EdU-labelled DNA fragments were biotinylated using Click-iT chemistry as reported above but using Biotin-TEG-Azide (Berry &amp; Associates) instead of Picolyl-azide-PEG4-Biotin. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche). Biotinylated fragments were captured using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin (invitrogen) and EdU strands were purified by performing NaOH washes. Libraries were amplified in 9-11 PCR cycles. Libraries with mononucleosomal-sized inserts were isolated by double-sided size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), followed by a second clean-up with 1.0x AMPure XP beads. Fragment distribution of libraries was checked on a a Fragment Analyzer system (Agilent). Stranded input samples were prepared in parallel with SCAR-seq samples. Samples were sequenced single end (75bp) on a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina).</p><p id="P62">Reads were processed, mapped and histone partition signal was computed as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Briefly, for each strand the SCAR normalized signal (CPM) was computed in 1kb bins and smoothed in a uniform blur considering the neighbouring 30 bins on each side. For each 1kb window, the signal from its corresponding SCAR input was subtracted and negative values were set to zero. Input corrected windows with CPM &lt; 0.3 on both strands were filtered out and not considered for further analyses. The final partition score for each 1kb window was calculated as: Partition = (F - R)/(F + R) where F and R correspond to the number of normalized and input-corrected reads for the forward and reverse strand, respectively. The partition value relates to the ratio of histones with a specific modification being segregated to the nascent forward (Partition &gt; 0) or nascent reverse (Partition &lt; 0) strand within each window respectively. Okazaki-seq replication fork directionality (RFD) scores and filtered initiation zones (IZs) for mESC were taken from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>) and used to define replication via leading or lagging strand mechanism. The RFD score in Okazaki-seq is calculated like SCAR-seq partition scores but subtracting the forward (F) strand signal from the reverse (R) strand signal instead: RFD = (R - F)/(F + R).</p><p id="P63">The average partition signal from replicate 1 was used for visualization purposes in Partition line plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). To visualize the total reads in SCAR-seq, total mm10 mouse read counts were spike-in normalized to dm6 drosophila read counts as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) By using the uniquely mapping, deduplicated reads in millions, the EdU-enriched Input samples (“ClickedInputs”) was used as reference for relative spikeIn abundance and EdU labelling efficiency. To visualize global signal in SCAR-seq, number of uniquely mapped, deduplicated mm10 reads of the SCAR sample (in million reads) were normalized to DMSO for each mark and replicate and plotted in replicates using R (v4.1.2) in RStudio (v2021.9.2.382).</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>End-point DNA replication with yeast replisome</title><p id="P64">These were carried out as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), all stock protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis.

Two CAF-1 complexes associate with PCNA on DNA to assemble a nucleosome. CAF-1 competes with the leading strand DNA polymerase Polε for PCNA binding, but not with the lagging strand polymerase Polδ. Nevertheless, CAF-1 deposits newly synthesized histones on both daughter strands. This means that on the leading strand, chromatin assembly by CAF-1 cannot occur simultaneously with DNA synthesis, while on the lagging strand both processes are coupled.
