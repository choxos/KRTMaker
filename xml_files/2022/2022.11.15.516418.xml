However, despite intense interest in their origins, major genomic trends characterising the evolutionary route from a unicellular opisthokont ancestor to derived multicellular fungi remain poorly known. Here, we reconstructed gene family evolution across 123 genomes of fungi and relatives and show that a dominant trend in early fungal evolution has been the gradual shedding of protist genes and highly episodic innovation via gene duplication. We find that the gene content of early-diverging fungi is protist-like in many respects, owing to the conservation of protist genes in early fungi. While gene loss has been constant and gradual during early fungal evolution, our reconstructions show that gene innovation showed two peaks. Gene groups with the largest contribution to genomic change included extracellular proteins, transcription factors, as well as ones linked to the coordination of nutrient uptake with growth, highlighting the transition to a sessile osmotrophic feeding strategy and subsequent lifestyle evolution as important elements of early fungal evolution. Taken together, this work provided a highly resolved genome-wide catalogue of gene family changes across fungal evolution. This suggests that the genome of pre-fungal ancestors may have been transformed into the archetypal fungal genome by a combination of gradual gene loss, turnover and two large duplication events rather than by abrupt changes, and consequently, that the taxonomically defined fungal kingdom does not represent a genomically uniform assemblage of extant species characterized by diagnostic synapomorphies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genome evolution</kwd><kwd>genetic turnover</kwd><kwd>evolutionary transitions</kwd><kwd>osmotrophy</kwd><kwd>phylogenomics</kwd><kwd>Opisthokonta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The evolutionary diversification of lineages into clades of various sizes, some highly successful and species-rich while others less so, is an outcome of complex interactions between ecological opportunity, changing biotic and abiotic environments and the genetic makeup of the organisms representing the lineage. Inferring the genomic footprint of the emergence of kingdom-level clades and, conversely, innovations that underlie their evolutionary success have been hard to assess. Recently, comparative genomic approaches that allow ancestral genome content to be inferred based on extant genomes revealed that complex mechanisms, including novel and co-opted genes as well as gene loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> contributed to the origins various clades, including pro-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, metazoans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> or land plants (Embryophytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>). These patterns are consistent with proposed general trends of genome evolution7, however, whether they are universal across the tree of life is unknown.</p><p id="P4">Fungi are one of the evolutionarily most successful groups. They not only exhibit an extreme diversity in morphological traits, but also in ecological functions, which make them key players in the ecosystem as symbionts, parasites or saprobes, among others. Kingdom Fungi, defined in the broad sense to include Rozellomycota and Microsporidia (also known as Opisthosporidia) and Aphelidomycota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, encompasses at least 10 phylum-level clades, with most of its phylogenetic diversity found in early-diverging fungi (EDF), an informal group comprising Rozello-, Aphelido-, Chytridio-, Sanchytrio-, Blastocladio-, Olpidio-, Zoopago- and Mucoromycota as well as Microsporidia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Irrespective of significant flux in the taxonomic definition of Fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, how the earliest fungal ancestors are characterised and how they evolved from a unicellular opisthokont ancestor has been the subject of intense research. Reconstructions of the last universal fungal ancestor (LUFA) became more and more nuanced with the inclusion of newly discovered and/or classified early diverging lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These results contributed to our current understanding of LUFA as a unicellular phagotrophic parasite of microalgae, possessing motile cell stages with amoeboid and flagellar motility and a chitinous cell wall, at least in part of its life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, derived fungi (i.e., Dikarya) are sessile terrestrial osmotrophs that grow septate hyphae, and their cells are covered by a rigid cell wall throughout their life cycle. However, how LUFA and subsequent ancestors evolved modern fungal traits is poorly known, however, and systematic analyses of the genomic changes during this transformation are missing.</p><p id="P5">In this study we reconstructed gene family evolution in the fungal kingdom using 123 whole genomes and analysed temporal and functional trends in the genomic changes we inferred. We find that early diverging fungi are genetically intermediate between pre-fungal protists and Dikarya and that a gradual shedding of ancient protist gene families happened in parallel with the emergence of fungal novelties and expansion of pre-existing families in Fungi. The tempo and mode of gene turnover and innovation outlines major genomic trends and picture an episodic emergence of modern fungal traits, including multiple waves of gene family expansion and contraction related to key fungal traits. Our results reveal that taxonomically defined fungi don’t match with ‘genomic fungi’ and that early fungal evolution has been highly episodic with continuous gene turnover.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Early diverging fungi are intermediate between protists and the Dikarya</title><p id="P6">To obtain a global perspective on gene content differences between fungi and related opisthokonts, we first clustered protein sequences of 123 species into homologous protein groups (HGs, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). For this, we selected representatives of all, but one currently accepted fungal phyla (including Rozellomycota and Microsporidia, except Sanchythriomycota), as well as 17 Holozoa, Amoebozoa and Heterolobosea species as outgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). We inferred a species phylogeny by maximum likelihood analysis of a supermatrix of 272 single-copy orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Our phylogeny is highly supported and is largely congruent with phylogenies from recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Based on the HG membership data, a Principal Coordinate Analysis resolved phyla into distinct groups, indicating that gene content divergence correlates well with phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Early diverging fungi, especially chytrids and aphelids, instead of occupying distinct positions in the space, grouped with non-fungal protists, with the Blastocladio- and Zoopagomycota being transitional towards the Mucoromycota+Dikarya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, the Dikarya branched into two groups in a tree-like pattern corresponding to the Asco- and Basidiomycota, with secondarily reduced yeast-like lineages of both phyla falling closer to each other. The intermediate placement of early diverging fungi in the genomic space is consistent with a number of phenotypic (amoeboids, flagellated zoospores), ecological (parasites, phagotrophic feeding), biochemical and genetic similarities (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). Some of these have already been studied in detail, like the distribution of flagellar genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, cytoskeletal complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, class V-VII Chitin synthases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, cell-cycle system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, WASH complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> or cobalamin utilisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, whether protist genes are ubiquitous in EDF has not been systematically investigated. Based on these observations we asked whether the presence of protist-like genes is a broad genomic trend in EDF, and if so, how were these replaced by fungal novelties during the evolution of the fungal kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Gradual turnover of protist heritage and synapomorphies in fungi</title><p id="P8">By systematically searching for HGs with &gt;70% conservation in at least one taxonomic group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), present in the Holomycota but absent from Dikarya, we identified 540 families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). This indicates that EDF possesses a considerable number of HGs shared with protists, considerably more than previous anecdotal evidence suggested. For example, LUFA lost 41 of these, but possessed 499 HGs that are conserved in protists but are missing in Dikarya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Analysis of the extinction dynamics of the 540 HGs showed that they were lost in a stepwise manner, with the largest loss events, 76, 64 and 239 HGs inferred in nodes where Blastocladiomycota, Zoopagomycota and Dikarya, respectively, split from the backbone.</p><p id="P9">The 540 HGs included all gene families previously reported to be lost in EDF: subunits of WASH and VASP (lost in LUFA), WAVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the CyclOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> light sensing system (lost after Blastocladiomycota), flagellar genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (lost across the branching of Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, and <italic>Olpidium</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>), cobalamin synthesis proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, the replacement of the E2F cell cycle regulator by the SBF complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, different taxon sampling updated the inferred time point of these loss events in several cases. Moreover, these events covered only a minority (73 HGs, 13.5%) of the 540 HGs. To broadly understand the functions of gene families lost in EDF, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analyses (GO) in the 540 HGs, for each backbone node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). It revealed the significant overrepresentation of GO terms related to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins and members of IP3, DAG, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling pathways. We inferred both a copy number reduction and complete loss of HGs within these pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2-3</xref>). Shared ancestry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in Fungi and Metazoa was known, despite of the remarkable differences among them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, but our results revealed that the full complement of these pathways have been retained in fungi until the Mucoromycota-Dikarya MRCA. Our data set also showed that the gamma-secretase complex, which is involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis for various developmental and signalling processes and was thought to be absent in fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, in fact, was lost only in Dikarya, Olpidium, and the RM clade. Interestingly, several HGs associated with ubiquitination have also been lost during fungal evolution. Other functions highlighted by GO correspond to families annotated in extant holozoa as mechano- and voltage-sensitive channels, receptors (EGF, GPCRs) and mechanical or visual perception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Metazoan annotations of these families are the most precise that exist, but may be hardly informative as to the functions of these families in pre-fungal protists and EDF.</p><p id="P10">We also looked at core fungal novelties, defined here as HGs that evolved in one of the early fungal ancestors and are highly conserved (≥70%) in descendant lineages. Previous studies reported a shortage of fungal synapomorphies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, so we here tested if our genome-wide dataset can recover gene families specific to and conserved within fungi. We identified 163 HGs, considerably less than recent studies have, in animals and green plants (using 95% conservation threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). This suggests that novel core gene families are less prevalent in fungi, possible because fungi comprise several highly reduced clades (e.g. yeast lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, Microsporidia). Nevertheless, the 163 families originated across multiple nodes, with a larger grouping at the split of the Chytridiomycota (n=57, 35%, Node149, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that this node has seen key transitions in genome evolution (see 4<sup>th</sup> chapter). Conserved domain analysis of these 163 HGs revealed that 72 contain protein domains that are predominantly (≥99%) found in fungi, corroborating them as real fungal novelties. These comprise functions in spore formation (e.g. Spo71 and Sur7 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), mating (e.g. Ste3, Prm1 and Rsc7/Swp82 of SWI/SNF complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) or cell polarity (e.g. Spa2/Sph1, SOG2, of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), among others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 4a</xref>). We also detected families related to the cytoskeleton, the fungal cell wall (e.g. the Kre9/Knh1 family), intracellular trafficking, transporters and fungal-type mitosis/meiosis. We found a significant enrichment of transcription factors among novel HGs (Fisher’s exact test, P-value=0.002), including the origins of APSES, Copper fist, Opi1 and Fungal trans 2 families (see 4th chapter). Notably, the Velvet, Gti1/Pac2 and STE-like TF families, which are thought to be fungal specific, had representatives in early-diverging holozoans (<italic>Capsaspora, Salpingoeca</italic> and <italic>Corallochytrium</italic>) or in <italic>Fonticula</italic>. Using a domain-based search logic, we identified 186 HGs comprising fungal specific domains and contained functions relevant to sporulation, mating, intracellular transport, environmental sensing, chromatin remodelling, among others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 4b</xref>). Finally, HGs containing unannotated proteins are prevalent (17.8% of 163 and 14.5% of 186 HGs) among core fungal novelties, highlighting the understudied status of fungal-specific genes.</p><p id="P11">Taken together, our analyses revealed that early-diverging fungi possess a large number of HGs shared specifically with protists, and that these were gradually lost during evolution. The broad conservation of protist HGs may explain the morphological and genetic similarities between EDF and protists reported in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and also clarifies why the genome content of fungi reflects that of ancestral opisthokonts more than metazoan gene content does<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, our data revealed that the retention of protist genes is not restricted to certain gene families, but is a genome-wide trend in early-diverging fungi. At the same time, we identified several conserved gene families that originated in early fungi and were mostly conserved afterwards, as well as 186 less conserved families containing fungal-specific domains. Although most of these can’t be considered synapomorphies in the strict sense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, due to their imperfect conservation, this indicates that beyond losses, considerable novelty has also emerged in early fungal ancestors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>An interplay of gene loss and major bursts of gene duplication characterise fungal evolution</title><p id="P12">To obtain a detailed picture on gene repertoire changes and test if evolution is gradual or rather episodic, as some theories predict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, we reconstructed gene gain and loss dynamics for all HGs containing at least four proteins. Our reconstructions provide information on which genes were duplicated and lost in each of the HGs and at which branches of the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, LUFA was inferred to have had 12,761 genes, gained 913 and lost 295 compared to its immediate ancestor, corresponding to a moderate net expansion. Reconstructed ancestral proteome sizes ranged from 12,761 protein-coding genes in LUFA to 14,891 in the MRCA of Zoopagomycota and derived fungi. If we consider net changes (duplications minus losses), it seems that most of the genomes of early fungal ancestors contracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), with two exceptions. The first is the split of chytrids, while the second expanding ancestor is the MRCA of Zoopagomycota and derived fungi, which is inferred to have expanded by 791 genes (1,114 gains, 323 losses).</p><p id="P13">We find that gene duplication has been highly episodic, with five large burst events, whereas losses were ubiquitous in fungal backbone nodes. Of the five bursts of gene duplication two were inferred along the backbone of the fungal tree (nodes C and D on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), two in phylum-level clades (N-Neocallimastigomycota and L-Leotiomyceta) and one in the Opisthokonta MRCA (O). From the two large duplication events we inferred along the fungal backbone, the first, in the MRCA of chytrids and other fungi (C), was coupled with limited gene loss (2,455 gains, 382 losses), whereas the second, in the Dikarya (D), coupled with more loss (2,875 gene gains, 3,036 losses), suggesting again, it was rather a turnover event. In general, the relative constancy of ancestral proteome sizes, in joint consideration with the losses and pulses of gene duplication indicates high gene turnover in early fungal evolution. Thus, while proteome sizes changed moderately, gene content has undergone significant changes.</p><p id="P14">Duplication events C and D contained a qualitatively similar functional signal, with an enrichment of terms related to extracellular functions (e.g. GO:0005576), transmembrane transport (e.g. GO:0055085), cellulose binding (GO:0030248) and the fungal cell wall (e.g. GO:0016977). These may correspond to the transition from phagotrophy to osmotrophy and the chitinous cell wall, respectively, and reflect the improvement of extracellular digestive functions, as adaptations to the existence of increasingly complex and abundant plant material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. A significant enrichment of transcription factors (TF) was detected among duplicated genes across multiple nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>), consistent with results of novel core families (see above). Based on GO results, we identified an expansion of cyclins that transcends multiple nodes in early fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). In extant fungi, PCL cyclins coordinate the cell cycle with polarised growth in response to nutritional cues (phosphate, amino acid and glycogen metabolism)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, thus their diversification might have provided the basis of evolving sophisticated coordination of nutrient supply and growth. We detected further two bursts of duplication within fungi, one in the Leotiomyceta and one in the Neocallimastigomycota. These may correspond to periods of intense lineage-specific innovation which, in the latter clade, probably also reflects massive gene gains through HGT from bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Episodic genetic changes and major fungal innovations</title><p id="P15">We were next interested if the functional profile of inferred bursts of duplication correspond to hypothesised phenotypic changes in early fungal ancestors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The most dynamically changing (expanding and contracting) gene families and corresponding functions were identified by ranking families by their summed expansion/contraction dynamics across eight nodes from LUFA to the MRCA of Dikarya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). Among the 100 most dynamically expanding families, 51 contained extracellular proteins (mostly CAZymes), transporters or transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The remaining families included diverse functions, such as GPCRs, heterokaryon incompatibility genes, protein kinases and endochitinases, among others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). When we parsed these figures in the context of the two large duplication events, we found that 22.9% of the chytrid and 34.7% of the Dikarya duplication bursts were related to extracellular functions, transporters and transcription factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The importance of these gene families for genomic changes was also confirmed by functional enrichment analyses of HG duplication data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). Based on these observations, we below scrutinise extracellular, transporter and transcription factor families in more detail.</p><p id="P16">Mapping of families with predicted extracellular localisation (hereafter extracellular proteins, EP, for short) revealed a two-stage duplication dynamics, with large expansions in the MRCA of chytrids and rest of the fungi (from 441 to 653 genes) and in that of Dikarya (from 806 to 1,167 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In the first event, EP expansion was driven mainly by CAZYmes, whereas other extracellular functions, including proteases, made a more modest contribution. These expansions resulted in a shift in the CAZYme and SSP content of the EP from 34% in LUFA to 51% in the Dikarya MRCA. Within EPs PCWDE families follow similar patterns, but with a larger expansion at the MRCA of Dikarya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast to PCWDEs, FCW families showed proportionally more diversification in the chytrids than in the Dikarya, and large turnover in the Dikarya MRCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The diversification of EP, especially PCWDEs in the ancestor of chytrids and other fungi, suggests their role in the transition from phagotrophy to osmotrophy, while expansion of FCW-related families here may have contributed to the evolution of the fungal cell wall. The second burst, in the Dikarya, may be concomitant with the radiation of plant lignocellulose degrading lineages, possibly in response to the onset of the radiation of land plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In the ancestors of Blastocladiomycota, Olpidiomycota and Zoopagomycota and other fungi the lack of PWCDE expansion and a moderate expansion of proteases may be explained with the primarily non-plant-based nutrition of these clades.</p><p id="P17">For cell surface transmembrane transporters, we identified 253 HGs based on characteristic domains and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 7</xref>). Similar to CAZymes, transporters show a two-stage expansion, with the highest duplication rate inferred in the Dikarya MRCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Of the three largest transporter families, we found that ABC transporters and P-type ATPases showed contraction, whereas the Major Facilitator Superfamily underwent an extreme expansion in fungi. This makes sense considering that only the latter is able to transport a high variety of small molecules, including sugars, peptides and lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, whereas ABC transporters and P-type ATPases are primarily exporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and specific for cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, respectively. Given the role of transporters in osmotrophic nutrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, the correlated diversification of transporters with CAZymes and the inferred continuous increase of copy numbers in ancient fungal genomes suggest their importance in the refinement of fungal-type heterotrophy.</p><p id="P18">We identified 657 transcription factor (TF) HGs based on domain content and classified them into 52 putative TF families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>) following the work of Sheleste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and Mendoza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Mapping of these 657 HGs revealed a constant change in TFome during early fungal evolution. Looking at broad copy number dynamics, early nodes, such as the splits of chytrids (193 gains 3 losses) and Zoopagomycota (168 gains 5 losses) are almost exclusively dominated by gains with barely any losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) This implies that the TFomes of these clades are similar to those of protists, as suggested by de Mendoza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In contrast, later evolution of EDF is characterised by the high turnover of TFs: at MRCA of Mucoromycota and derived fungi we inferred 87 gains and 43 losses while in the Dikarya MRCA we detected 117 gains 184 losses. Losses in the Dikarya MRCA affected several families (e.g. bZIP, Myb, CBF-NFYA, GATA, Homeobox), and included the complete disappearance of E2F TDP, T-Box, and Tub families. Along the backbone nodes TFome diversity (based on Shannon index) increased, with the highest number of ancestral TFs inferred in the MRCA of Mucoromycota and Dikarya (784 TFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In line with this, extant Mucoromycota contain the most TFs among fungi, with Shannon-based diversities similar to those of EDFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The TFomes of extant Dikarya, especially Ascomycota species show similar sizes but lower diversity, due partly to the expansion of the Fungal trans 2 and Zn cluster TF families, and partly to losses of certain families in the Dikarya.</p><p id="P19">Inferred copy number of TFs in fungal ancestors, outlined three ‘epochs’, within each of which ancestral TF repertoires seemed to be relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Transitions between these epochs are concominant with remarkable historical events, like emergence of—mostly anucleate—rhizoids and osmotrophy, or that of terrestrialization and of aseptate hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Ranking of TF families based on the cumulative net change along the fungal backbone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>) revealed that The most dynamically changing TF families included both pan-eukaryotic (e.g. C2H2-like, bZIP, HLH, HSF, Homeobox, GATA) and predominantly fungal TFs (e.g. Zn cluster, Fungal trans 2, APSES, Velvet and Gti1/Pac2), irrespective of their raw copy numbers. Several families expanded considerably more than the whole proteome, indicating that their copy numbers are decoupled from proteome size. For example, while the proteome size of the MRCA of Chytrids and derived fungi increased by 16.2% relative to the preceding node, the Zn cluster and bZIP families expanded by 738% and 325%, respectively; suggesting expansion driven by adaptation. Interestingly, C2H2 TFs underwent a massive expansion in the Opisthokonta ancestor. This family is highly diverse in both Holozoa and the Holomycota, with clade specific contractions in secondarily simplified clades, such as yeast-like Dikarya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Taken together, the evolutionary dynamics of transcription factors differs from genome-wide patterns, in that, albeit also episodic, showed expansions in different nodes. Nevertheless, these data suggest that broad rewiring of fungal gene regulatory networks has transcended multiple ancestors in EDF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P22">The origins of highly diverse clades across the tree of life are remarkable evolutionary events, but are they remarkable from a genomic perspective or because we attach taxonomic definitions, such as a kingdom, to some of them? Based on systematic analyses we inferred that protein coding gene content has changed drastically during early fungal evolution. However, in contrast to animals and plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, this has not happened abruptly at the taxonomic limit of the kingdom, even if competing taxonomic circumscriptions of Fungi are considered. Rather, we found a significant retention and stepwise loss of protist genes in early diverging fungi, combined with the episodic expansion of novel and ancient gene families. We also identified major functional trends and the most dynamically changing gene families, which allowed us to relate genomic changes to trait evolution during the early evolution of fungi.</p><p id="P23">Our systematic analyses revealed that early-diverging fungi retained hundreds of protist gene families that are missing in the Dikarya. These were lost gradually or replaced by fungal-specific genes (e.g. E2F cell cycle regulator by SBF24) during fungal evolution. We think this explains why EDF gravitate towards protists in gene content-based analyses (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and provides a genome-wide explanation for sporadic evidence for the similarity of EDFs to protists from analyses of single genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, individual genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> or TF-omes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. At the same time, we detected a limited number of gene families that could be considered synapomorphic for fungi, in agreement with previous conjectures on the lack of synapomorphies in the kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">The retention of protist genes and the lack of clear synapomorphies for fungi blur lines between fungi and related protists and may explain why the taxonomic limits of fungi have been challenging to define and are still a matter of debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In other words, taxonomically defined Fungi don’t match with any clade we could define, based on gene content, as ‘genomic Fungi’, a situation that would not change with the exclusion of Opisthosporidia from fungi. Defining ‘genomic Fungi’ is also complicated by patterns of gene turnover, nevertheless, gene content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and novel gene families suggest that, if any fungal clade, the Dikarya comprises species with a broader set of signature gene families.</p><p id="P25">Gene loss has been recently named as a dominant mechanism of metazoan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and plant evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Similar patterns were often observed in ancestral genome reconstructions, which gave rise to the hypothesis of genome evolution comprising periods of genome expansion resulting in complex ancestral genomes, followed by genome streamlining via gene loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, early fungal evolution may be better viewed as a series of turnover events, in which gene loss aided the gradual shedding of protist traits whereas innovation was probably fueled by two bursts and continuous small-scale duplication of genes.</p><p id="P26">Functional analysis of gene duplications and losses outlined major functional trends in the evolution of early fungal genomes. Remarkable lost or contracting gene groups were related to phagocytosis, the flagellum, cell cycle regulation and signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), among others. For highly duplicated gene groups, a dominant functional signal was related to extracellular proteins (e.g. secreted CAZymes) and transporters which can be linked to the transition from phagotrophy to osmotrophy and the subsequent sophistication of extracellular digestive and uptake mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These also explained a considerable portion of the duplication events in the chytrid and Dikarya ancestors, though it should be noted that a myriad other functions were also represented among the most expanding families. For example, transcription factors emerged as one of the most dynamically changing gene groups, suggesting a broad rewiring of gene regulatory mechanisms in early fungi. Another group of dynamically changing regulators were PCL-type cyclins, which link nutritional status of fungal cells with the cell cycle and thus the expansion of this family is perhaps related to balancing nutrient assimilation and growth, an important regulatory mechanism for hyphal osmotrophs. Our genome-wide catalogue of changes revealed a large array of other functions as well, many of which cannot currently be easily linked to phenotypes or ecological functions due to the paucity of knowledge on gene function.</p><p id="P27">Taken together, this study reconstructed the history of genomic change in the fungal kingdom at unprecedented detail and provides a resource for further analyses of fungal genome evolution, also at smaller evolutionary time scales. We conclude that, albeit sharp genetic changes at the border of the fungal kingdom were not inferred, a large turnover of protistan genes and a gradual emergence of fungal novelties in early fungal evolution portray a clear genetic roadmap for the emergence of modern fungi from a unicellular algal parasite ancestor.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P28">Dataset assembly and clustering of proteins To evenly sample clades in the fungal kingdom, we sampled 106 fungal species, consisting of proteomes from all known phylum level clades, with the exception of Sanchytriomycota, which were not published prior to our data collection. In addition, as outgroups, 17 non-fungal species were sampled to represent Heterolobosea, Amoebozoa, Holozoa, and Nucleariids. Proteome sequences were downloaded from the JGI Genome Portal and NCBI/Ensembl (before July 2021;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>). All-vs-all similarity searches of the 123 proteomes were performed with MMseqs251 using three iterations, with sensitivity set to 6.5, max-seqs to 15,000, e-profile set to 0.001, a preliminary coverage threshold set to 0.2, and an e-value threshold set to 1e<sup>-4</sup>. We then performed an asymmetric coverage filtering (requiring 20% coverage for the longer and 80% for the shorter protein) and Markov clustering with an inflation parameter 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. After clustering, we removed contaminating proteins from gene families following the logic of Richter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Further, to achieve better completeness of clusters without increasing noise, we merged clusters based on similarity, using the all vs all output of MMSeqs and the results of HMM search between the consensus sequence and HMM profiles of clusters. Based on the MMSeqs output file, the connection intensity of clusters (i.e a network) was constructed. These cluster networks were iteratively reduced by excluding the weakest nodes-sorted by the number of connections between the two clusters, normalised to cluster size-until the maximum diameter of a network was three. Of these cluster pairs, only those that achieved an e-value cut-off at least 1e-10 in the HMM search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmmer.org/">http://hmmer.org/</ext-link>) with an asymmetric coverage of 75/20% (HMM profile and consensus, respectively) and whose match score reached at least 75% of the self-match were allowed to be merged.

Letters in bold represent the five largest bursts of duplication that comprised more than 2,000 gain events. Pie charts, next to the nodes D and C represent the contribution of four functional categories to gene gains.
