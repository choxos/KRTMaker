However, genome-wide information on deregulated nucleosome occupancy and its implications in primary cancer cells is scarce. Here, we performed a systematic comparison of high-resolution nucleosome maps in peripheral-blood B-cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and healthy individuals at single base pair resolution. Our investigation uncovered significant changes of both nucleosome positioning and packing in CLL. Globally, the spacing between nucleosomes (the nucleosome repeat length, NRL) was shortened in CLL. This effect was stronger in the more aggressive IGHV-unmutated than IGHV-mutated CLL subtype. Changes in nucleosome occupancy at specific sites were linked to active chromatin remodelling and reduced DNA methylation. Nucleosomes lost or gained in CLL in comparison with non-malignant B-cells marked differential binding of 3D chromatin organisers such as CTCF as well as immune response-related transcription factors, allowing delineating epigenetic mechanisms affected in CLL. Furthermore, patients could be better assigned to CLL subtypes according to nucleosome occupancy at cancer-specific sites than based on DNA methylation or gene expression. Thus, nucleosome positioning constitutes a novel readout to dissect molecular mechanisms of disease progression and to stratify patients. Furthermore, we anticipate that the global nucleosome positioning changes detected in our study, like the reduced NRL, can be exploited for liquid biopsy applications based on cell-free DNA to monitor disease progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults in the Western world. Over the past decade novel therapies against specific targets like Bruton tyrosine kinase have emerged in parallel with an increased understanding of its molecular pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Quesada et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ferreira et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Nabhan and Rosen 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosch and Dalla-Favera 2019</xref>). Previous genome-wide studies of CLL (epi)genomics and transcriptomics have focused on DNA mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Landau et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Puente et al. 2015</xref>) and the interplay between gene expression, deregulated chromatin features like DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor (TF) binding as well as long range chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ferreira et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kulis et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Queiros et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Oakes et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rendeiro et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beekman et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. 2021</xref>). However, the primary chromatin structure of CLL with respect to the location of nucleosomes within the genome has not been systematically characterized in patient samples, which is also the case for almost all other tumour entities. Nucleosome positioning affects gene expression by modulating accessibility of TFs to their DNA binding sites as an important part of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Nucleosome maps thus provide insight into the gene regulatory mechanisms in disease and can be used for diagnostics in the new generations of liquid biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shtumpf et al. 2022</xref>). Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions are usually obtained by digesting the linker DNA with nucleases such as MNase and identifying nucleosome positions from sequencing the DNA associated with the histone octamer core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Teif and Clarkson 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shtumpf et al. 2022</xref>). Most previous studies of this kind have investigated genome-wide nucleosome positioning in model systems, human cell lines or non-malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schones et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Valouev et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gaffney et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kundaje et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Diermeier et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ho et al. 2014</xref>). Related methods include single cell-based Strand-seq, which is inherently more stochastic and moderately correlates with bulk MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jeong et al. 2022</xref>), as well as ATAC-seq that is frequently used for cancer cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Grandi et al. 2022</xref>). The latter method is well suited to detect changes in positioning of 1-2 nucleosomes near TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beekman et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>), but does not provide genome-wide nucleosome maps. On the other hand, the need for precisely mapped nucleosome locations across the whole genome of malignant and non-malignant B-cells is becoming very important in view of the increasing use in clinical diagnostics of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which contains nucleosome-protected genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Snyder et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Im et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lo et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shtumpf et al. 2022</xref>). This need goes beyond blood cancers, because even in the case of solid tumours most of the pieces of cfDNA comes from blood cells and only a small fraction originates from tumour tissues. Here, we exploited our high-throughput sequencing experiments with MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>) at a sequencing depth of more than four billion DNA sequence reads to address the following aims: (i) Derive complete genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps at base pair resolution and detect individual nucleosome position change in human primary malignant versus non-malignant B-cells (NBCs) from patients with CLL and healthy donors. (ii) Dissect both the repositioning of individual nucleosomes and the collective behaviour of nucleosomes in CLL genome-wide at the global chromatin reorganisation level, e.g., with respect to the average spacing between nucleosomes. (iii) Compare nucleosome occupancy in two clinically important CLL subtypes that have the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutated (M-CLL) or unmutated (U-CLL) and are associated with favourable and poor prognosis, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CLL is characterized by global changes of nucleosome positioning</title><p id="P4">We determined nucleosome positions in malignant B-cells from CLL patients and NBCs pooled from healthy individuals using high-coverage MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). While individual samples were characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of nucleosome profiles, the averages across groups showed clear differences between non-malignant and malignant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). When 4 billion paired-end reads obtained in our experiments were combined to compare the average nucleosome occupancies in 100-bp bins across the genome in CLL patients versus healthy individuals, the Pearson’s correlation was remarkably high (<italic>r</italic> = 0.95), indicating that only a small fraction of the genome undergoes significant changes of nucleosome occupancy in CLL versus NBCs. Random non-specific regions had very similar profiles of nucleosome occupancy for NBCs and CLL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2A</xref>), while regulatory regions showed punctate changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures S2B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Such regions typically showed distinct nucleosome occupancy changes in nanodomains of size ~1-5 kb. In addition, we observed two global genome-wide effects. Firstly, the length of nucleosome-protected DNA fragments was shorter in CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both CLL subtypes were characterized by shorter DNA fragments than non-malignant controls, with U-CLL particularly enriched with subnucleosomal fragments. Interestingly, cell-free DNA of cancer patients is also known to be enriched with shorter fragments in comparison to healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lo et al. 2021</xref>). To study nucleosome repositioning separately from this effect, in the following analysis we applied filtering to consider only DNA fragment sizes between 120-180 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures S1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). A second global, genome-wide effect was the shortening of the average distance between centres of neighbouring nucleosomes, which is given by the nucleosome repeat length (NRL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The NRL decreased from ~200 bp in NBCs to ~198 bp in M-CLL to ~195 bp in U-CLL, which is quite large change, comparable to changes between different cell types during stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Teif et al. 2012</xref>). Furthermore, this effect became stronger inside differentially methylated regions (DMRs), where NRL decreased from 200 bp in NBCs to 196 bp in M-CLL to 193 bp in U-CLL.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Nucleosome repositioning occurs preferentially in DNA methylation-depleted regions</title><p id="P5">Next, we asked what distinguishes genomic loci with unchanged or changed nucleosome occupancy in CLL. DNA methylation appeared to stabilise nucleosomes, with nucleosomes in highly methylated regions keeping their locations across NBCs, U-CLL and M-CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, nucleosomes that shifted more than 20% between NBCs and CLL were mostly depleted of DNA methylation in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we also detected significant differences of nucleosome occupancy associated with CLL-specific changes of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The difference in nucleosome occupancy was clearly detectable in NBCs versus M-CLL and was even more pronounced in NBCs versus U-CLL. For comparison, we calculated nucleosome profiles around ALU repeats, which are known to stabilize nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Teif et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Nucleosome occupancy around ALUs showed a distinct, stable profile across all conditions, underlining that the variability we detected in CLL cells is coupled to DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Nucleosome relocation correlates with chromatin remodelling activity</title><p id="P6">To characterise regions with increased or decreased nucleosome occupancy in CLL in further detail, we segmented the whole genome into non-overlapping 100-bp bins and calculated the normalized nucleosome occupancy for each bin. We then defined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across all samples from the same group. Stable nucleosome occupancy regions were then compared pairwise between the three conditions. Regions where nucleosome occupancy significantly differed between the two conditions were selected for further analysis and annotated as lost-nucleosome or gained-nucleosome regions correspondingly. This resulted in 4,361 regions that lost nucleosomes in M-CLL vs NBCs, 10,178 regions that gained nucleosomes in M-CLL vs NBCs, 12,161 regions that lost nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs and 7,815 regions that gained nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>). The pairwise comparison of M-CLL and U-CLL revealed 5,117 regions with higher and 307 regions with lower nucleosome occupancy in U-CLL. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E-G</xref> show average profiles of nucleosome occupancy around regions that lost or gained nucleosomes in the two CLL subtypes versus NBCs. The nucleosome occupancy profiles of these regions were more similar between the two CLL subtypes and distinct from NBCs. DNA methylation profiles of these regions showed different behaviour between the two CLL subtypes: regions that lost nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs were enriched with DNA methylation, while those that lost nucleosomes in M-CLL vs NBCs were depleted of DNA methylation. Similarly, regions that gained nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs (but not M-CLL vs NBCs) were depleted of DNA methylation. These DNA methylation profiles were highly reproducible across all samples with the same condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>). To check whether nucleosome repositioning in CLL is an active process driven by remodellers, we compared the nucleosome maps with the binding of a remodeller BRG1 in NBCs assessed previously by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abraham et al. 2013</xref>). Nucleosomes that did not change their locations between conditions were depleted of BRG1 in NBCs, whereas shifted nucleosomes (&gt;20% change of their start/end coordinates) were enriched with BRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). The regions that gained nucleosomes in CLL versus NBCs had more than a 3-fold enrichment of BRG1 in comparison with neighbouring regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). The loci bound by another chromatin remodeller CHD1 in lymphoblastoid B-cells were also enriched in these regions, in particular for gained-nucleosomes in M-CLL with &gt;20-fold enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). Furthermore, the regions that gained nucleosomes in M-CLL also had the largest overlap with loci identified in a recently published ChP-seq dataset as bound by histone deacetylase HDAC1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients (up to 15-fold enrichment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). This suggests that nucleosome relocation in CLL is subtype-specific and the result of active chromatin remodelling.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nucleosome repositioning marks CLL-specific gene regulation</title><p id="P7">Regions with gained nucleosome occupancy in one of the CLL subtypes vs NBCs were enriched with promoters, active enhancers, CpG islands and CTCF sites, while the most pronounced nucleosome loss was at active CLL enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). For CTCF sites, the fold-enrichment increased with the increase of the similarity to the consensus CTCF motif. Regions with gained nucleosome occupancy in CLL were enriched with cancer-related pathways including both generic pathways typically deregulated in cancer as well as CLL-specific pathways such as B-cell receptor signalling (BCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Interestingly, the largest group of genes marked by regions that gained nucleosomes in CLL was related to immune system (&gt;350 genes, P=0.01). A similar pairwise comparison of regions with differential nucleosome occupancy between U-CLL and M-CLL is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5C-D</xref>. In addition, we repeated this analysis including all DNA fragments from MNase-assisted H3 ChIP-seq without size-selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>). This revealed that the largest fraction of nucleosomes repositioned in CLL versus NBCs resides in 700,000 regions of 100-bp size. These loci were termed “variable” because their nucleosome occupancy significantly varied across CLL patients while being stable across all NBC samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S6A</xref>). The most informative group of nucleosome changes that distinguished CLL was the fraction of gained nucleosomes residing in regions where nucleosome occupancy in CLL increased in comparison with NBCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S6D</xref>). The intersection of such gained-nucleosome regions with gene promoters marked the B-cell receptor signalling pathway (BCR) as the top hit (<italic>p</italic> = 1.6e-5), followed by the T-cell receptor signalling pathway (<italic>p</italic> = 3.2e-4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The correlated differences of nucleosome occupancy and gene activity could also be related to a differential activity of cis-regulatory enhancer regions in NBCs and CLL. Active enhancers (defined previously from multi-omics profiling in this patient cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>)) were characterized by nucleosome depletion, whereas all enhancers, which are mostly inactive in each given state, were characterized on average by increased nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). Of note, active NBC enhancers had very similar DNA methylation profiles between U-CLL and M-CLL, whereas the nucleosome occupancy profiles allowed distinguishing the CLL subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Nucleosome occupancy differed between CLL and NBCs even at the scale of ~100,000 bp based on A and B chromatin compartments defined with Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. 2021</xref>). Chromatin domains that are open and active in NBCs (A compartments) were characterized by nucleosome depletion, which disappears in U-CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). On the other hand, the inactive and closed B compartments displayed a flat profile of nucleosome occupancy in all cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, functionally relevant differences in CLL nucleosome occupancy occurred both at the level of promoters and enhancers, as well as on the mesoscale of active chromatin subcompartments.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Nucleosome positioning, CTCF binding and histone modifications are correlated</title><p id="P9">Next, we focused on regions with deregulated CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Sites that were bound by CTCF both in NBCs and CLL were defined as “common”. Nucleosome occupancy profiles around common CTCF sites had the same shape for NBCs and CLL and showed a pronounced depletion in the center surrounded by characteristic oscillations reflecting the regular nucleosome array positioned by CTCF. The average DNA methylation profiles were depleted in a wider area +/-200 bp surrounding common CTCF sites both in NBCs and CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the case of sites that lost CTCF binding in CLL (termed “lost”), NBCs were characterized by nucleosome depletion around CTCF, but both U-CLL and M-CLL had a peak of nucleosome occupancy instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The DNA methylation profiles also gained peaks near lost CTCF sites in CLL. Interestingly, M-CLL and U-CLL displayed different trends: M-CLL had higher nucleosome occupancy around both common and lost CTCF sites. On the other hand, the increase in DNA methylation near lost CTCF sites was higher in U-CLL. We also investigated the effect of CTCF loss in CLL on different histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The largest changes were observed for the active enhancer mark H3K4me1, which went down in CLL, as well as the repressive heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which both went up in CLL. In addition, we evaluated a recently reported pan-cancer set of CTCF sites undergoing consistent changes across several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fang et al. 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S7A-B</xref>). Nucleosome occupancy at these CTCF sites was not significantly different between NBCs and CLL, which means that the effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> is specific for CLL.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Nucleosome repositioning reveals differential TF binding in CLL</title><p id="P10">To study effects of TF-nucleosome interaction we determined enriched TF motifs inside regions with differential nucleosome occupancy in CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), and calculated nucleosome profiles around their binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-C</xref>). This analysis revealed three major cases: (i) For one set of TF binding sites, nucleosome profiles in NBCs, M-CLL and U-CLL had a similar shape but differed in average nucleosome occupancy (e.g., ZNF263, PAX9 and PAX5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). For these motifs, U-CLL and M-CLL were more similar to each other than to NBCs. (ii) In NBCs, M-CLL and U-CLL the shape of nucleosome profiles was similar but NBCs and M-CLL profiles located closer to each other and further away from U-CLL (e.g., TCLF5, HES5 and E2F3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In this group, the different average nucleosome occupancy level likely reflects the change in local nucleosome landscape not related directly to the binding of a given TF but rather determined by the binding of other factors nearby. (iii) The shape of nucleosome occupancy profiles changed between CLL and NBCs. These included the transition from low nucleosome occupancy in NBCs to a peak in CLL, e.g., JUND, PKNOX2, FOSL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Such nucleosome profile changes were accompanied by gene expression differences in CLL versus NBCs, e.g., a ~2-fold reduction for FOSL1. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref> show nucleosome occupancy profiles of TFs enriched in regions with differential nucleosome occupancy defined above but limited to binding sites inside CLL-specific ATAC-seq peaks.</p><p id="P11">In addition to the analysis based on nucleosome-size DNA fragments above, we also performed a similar analysis for all DNA fragments without size-filtering. The analysis of 2,508 promoters with gained-nucleosomes revealed B-cell receptor signalling as the top enriched pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Tables S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>) and the so-called CG-box as the top enriched motif (p-value = 1.1e-37, 591 out of 2,508 sites, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S3</xref>), suggesting that TFs recognizing this motif such as SP1/2 and EGR1/2 can be involved in CLL deregulation. The expression of genes encoding these TFs was only moderately changed in comparison with non-malignant controls (log2 fold change -0.65 for SP1, -2.4 for SP2, -3.0 for EGR1, - 0.26 for EGR2), indicating that nucleosome repositioning can be more informative than gene expression in peripheral blood B-cells for assessing TF activity. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S7C-D</xref> shows that nucleosome occupancy profiles around SP1 change from nucleosome depletion across all SP1 sites to nucleosome occupancy peak for a subset of SP1 sites covered by “variable” nucleosomes in CLL. A less frequent motif present in promoters of these genes can be recognized by SOX11 and SOX4 among other TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). SOX11 was proposed as a prognostic marker in CLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Roisman et al. 2015</xref>), while SOX4 plays a role in other B-cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sarkar and Hochedlinger 2013</xref>). Interestingly, SOX4 was 128-fold down-regulated in CLL vs. non-malignant controls based on our RNA-seq data. A SP1 binding site inside SOX4 promoter was associated with a distinct nucleosome peak appearing at the place of the nucleosome depletion in non-malignant controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2D</xref>), suggesting that differential SP1/2 or EGR1/2 binding might occur upstream of SOX4 deregulation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>CLL patients can be stratified based on nucleosome occupancy</title><p id="P12">We examined the classification of samples based on different epigenetic parameters. First, we asked whether it is possible to distinguish NBCs, M-CLL and U-CLL based on gene expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that principal component analysis (PCA) of gene expression values clearly distinguished CLL from NBCs, but not the CLL subtypes from each other. Second, we attempted the same classification using DNA methylation of gene promoters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> depicts the clear differences in DNA methylation between sample types. However, promoter DNA-methylation did not segregate the three groups very effectively and there was a partial overlap among the three clouds/sample types. Finally, we asked whether the nucleosome repositioning as identified in this study can serve as a novel biomarker. For example, nucleosome occupancy at the 100-bp regions which lost nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs in each of the 26 samples (including 6 NBCs, 4 U-CLL and 16 M-CLL) was informative in PCA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-E</xref>, PCA based on nucleosome occupancy allows distinguishing not only CLL from NBCs, but also M-CLL from U-CLL. Notably, regions with differential nucleosome occupancy defined using only one CLL subtype worked to distinguish the other CLL subtype from NBCs as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-F</xref>). Interestingly, regions that gained or lost nucleosomes in U-CLL vs NBCs or lost nucleosomes in M-CLL vs NBCs allowed good stratification of all studied subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-E</xref>), whereas regions that gained nucleosomes in M-CLL were common between CLL subtypes and less effective in stratifying patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Our additional calculations showed that unlike gained-nucleosome and lost-nucleosome regions, nucleosome occupancy or DNA methylation inside other genomic features such as promoters, enhancers or CTCF sites is not as effective in distinguishing M-CLL, U-CLL and NBCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures S8</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">In CLL, large progress in understanding the contribution of chromatin features to disease pathogenesis has been made in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beekman et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gaiti et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Pastore et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rendeiro et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. 2021</xref>). However, the contribution of nucleosome positioning has not been integrated. This essential knowledge gap was addressed here by compiling occupancy maps at single nucleosome resolution in NBCs, U-CLL and M-CLL. Based on these data, our study introduces nucleosome positioning as a powerful biomarker that reveals novel mechanistic insights of chromatin-mediated deregulation in CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>). We detected changes of the nucleosome landscape at two levels. Firstly, our analysis revealed global genome-wide changes with a striking decrease of the NRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the distribution of nucleosome-protected DNA fragments was skewed towards subnucleosomal fragments in the case of M-CLL, and even more so for U-CLL, while NBCs were enriched with nucleosome-plus-linker particles. This finding has important implications for understanding nucleosome positioning patterns in malignant and non-malignant B-cells for cancer diagnostics based on biopsy approaches that analyse the size distribution of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from body fluids as a tumour marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lo et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shtumpf et al. 2022</xref>). NRL changes at the scale of few bp are known to occur during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Teif et al. 2012</xref>), but have not been evaluated previously in paired normal/cancer cells of the same type. Importantly, NRL changes reported here were visible not only between CLL and NBCs, but also between the two subtypes of CLL, with the more aggressive U-CLL subgroup having the smallest NRL. The effect of NRL shortening in cancer reported here may be not limited to CLL. In a separate work, we found a similar NRL shortening effect in paired tumour versus normal breast tissues from breast cancer patients (Jacob D.R., Guiblet W.M., Mamayusupova H., Shtumpf M., Gretton S., Correa C., Dellow E., Ruje L., Ciuta I., Agrawal S.P., Shafiei N., Vainshtein Y., Clarkson C.T., Thorn G.J., Sohn K., Pradeepa M.M., Chandrasekharan S., Klenova E., Zhurkin V.B. and Teif V.B., <italic>under review</italic>). Thus, NRL changes may be generally informative to identify tumour subtypes that are distinct in their disease course.</p><p id="P14">Our analysis of local changes of nucleosome occupancy showed that DNA methylation correlated with more stably bound nucleosomes, while nucleosomes that shift in CLL are at less methylated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). This relation was also observed in our studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Teif et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wiehle et al. 2019</xref>). Such nucleosome repositioning is likely happening as an active process, which is reflected by the enrichment of histone deacetylases HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>) and chromatin remodellers BRG1 (SMARCA4) and CHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2I-K</xref>). BRG1 is known to be involved in establishing B-cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bossen et al. 2015</xref>) and B-cell proliferation and germinal centre formation depends on enhancer activation by BRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schmiedel et al. 2021</xref>). Mutations in CHD1 homolog CHD2 are among the most frequent mutations in CLL and characteristic of the M-CLL subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rodriguez et al. 2015</xref>). It is of note that this interplay between differential DNA methylation and nucleosome remodelling could also be one of the mechanisms that lead to NRL changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Regions that undergo nucleosome occupancy changes were particularly enriched for CTCF binding sites, enhancers and promoters, and changes at promoters were associated with CLL-specific and immunity-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). On a larger scale, we observed changes of nucleosome occupancy at enhancers and active chromatin compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Sites with CTCF binding loss become covered by nucleosomes and gain methylation in CLL subtype-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Among the seven histone modifications that we profiled, the most dramatic changes were correlated with the active enhancer mark H3K4me1 and the heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The analysis of the interplay between TF binding and nucleosome positioning allowed to reconstruct CLL-specific TF networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The most enriched TF binding sites inside regions with differential nucleosome occupancy were related to immunity (such as IRF8 and IRF1), and specifically the germinal centre establishment (BCL6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Capello et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mlynarczyk et al. 2019</xref>), as well as 3D genome organization (CTCF and its interaction partners, including cancer-specific competitor BORIS (CTCFL) and methylation-dependent factor NRF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Domcke et al. 2015</xref>). Importantly, several deregulated TFs detected in this study have not been previously associated with CLL, although some are involved in other cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Overall, three major groups of CLL-specific TFs were identified: (i) TFs for which nucleosome occupancy profiles around binding sites had quantitatively similar change in the average occupancy level in U-CLL and M-CLL versus NBCs, including PAX9 and PAX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, higher expression of PAX9 was reported for U-CLL and linked to poorer clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rani et al. 2017</xref>), whereas PAX5 is critical for both non-malignant B-cell development and CLL pathogenesis and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Puente et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ott et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Klintman et al. 2021</xref>). (ii) TFs for which nucleosome profiles in M-CLL were closer to NBC, such as TCLF5, HES5 and E2F3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). E2F3 is a miR-34a target and a repressor of the ARF/p53 pathway. miR-34a has been linked to the chemotherapy resistance network in CLL and its low expression is associated with p53 aberrations and Richter transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balatti et al. 2018</xref>). (iii) TFs with different shape of nucleosome occupancy profiles between CLL and NBCs, such as a depletion of nucleosome occupancy in NBCs changed to a peak in CLL (e.g., JUND, PKNOX2 and FOSL1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H-J</xref>). PKNOX2 acts as tumour suppressor in gastric cancer via activation of IGFBP5 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>). JUND is involved in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Papoudou-Bai et al. 2016</xref>), while FOSL1 has been reported to promote carcinogenesis and metastasis in various cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jiang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>), but not in CLL. FOSL1 gene encodes the FRA1 antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jiang et al. 2020</xref>), which forms an AP-1 complex with the protein of the JUN family to exert its oncogenic effect. Thus, it is likely no coincidence that both FOSL1 and JUND change the shape of nucleosome occupancy profiles at their binding sites. Gene expression of FOSL1 is decreased ~2-fold in CLL versus NBCs, which may explain why many of the binding sites occupied by FOSL1 in NBCs become occupied by a nucleosome in CLL. It is also worth noting that AP-1 is known to interact with SWI/SNF chromatin remodellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Vierbuchen et al. 2017</xref>), thus providing possible connection to the involvement of BRG1 in active nucleosome repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-J</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Finally, we asked whether nucleosome positioning <italic>per se</italic> can be used as a biomarker for CLL patient stratification. Principal component analysis (PCA) of nucleosome occupancies in regions that lost or gained nucleosomes in U-CLL versus NBCs allowed identification of not only U-CLL and NBCs, but also M-CLL, which was not included in the initial selection of nucleosome-sensitive regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-F</xref>). A similar analysis based on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) was less effective. In part, this can be explained by the fact that CLL-specific gene expression is mostly occurring in lymph nodes – the primary site of CLL proliferation – while B-cells from peripheral blood are already “primed” for malignant-specific expression by nucleosome positioning, but need in addition a specific microenvironment for this expression to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Herishanu et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, PCA based on DNA methylation was confounded by the developmental trajectory of individual CLL cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), while nucleosome occupancy-based analysis was able to resolve this issue, e.g., when using subsets of regions which lost nucleosomes in CLL. Thus, given the extensive heterogeneity in CLL, the analysis of nucleosome positioning could enhance our understanding for critical malignant transformation events that are subtype-specific, indicative for distinct cell of origin and diverse microenvironmental cues.</p><p id="P18">In summary, nucleosome positioning undergoes large-scale changes in tumour cells, as reflected in the NRL decrease in CLL in addition to specific local changes at functional genomic elements. Thus, the analysis of aberrant nucleosome positions in primary tumour cells is a powerful approach for distinguishing malignant subtypes and, at the same time, informs about associated deregulation mechanisms. One particular area of application of the nucleosome positioning framework described here is patient diagnostics based on cfDNA, using liquid biopsies of peripheral blood samples. In the latter case, even if the condition that is being diagnosed is a solid tumour, the majority of cfDNA comes from nucleosome-protected regions in blood cells, similar to the nucleosome maps studied here. Finally, defining patient subsets using nucleosome positioning is a promising novel approach to stratify patient subgroups which can be exploited for personalized precision oncology.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Generation of normalised nucleosome occupancy profiles</title><p id="P19">The MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq reads in NBCs, M-CLL and U-CLL were from our previous study (EGA archive, access number EGAS00001002518) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mallm et al. 2019</xref>).
