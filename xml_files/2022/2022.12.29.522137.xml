They undergo compositional changes in response to environmental factors, which can profoundly influence their functions. For example, antibiotic treatment can disturb the human gut microbiota, altering its effect on the host metabolism and immune system, and facilitating the invasion of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Such microbiota shifts are difficult to predict as they often occur irregularly and in different contexts. However, when linked to recurrent or predetermined environmental changes, microbial communities can undergo consistent compositional transitions, providing excellent opportunities to study ecological interactions governing community shifts. For example, bacterioplankton communities in the ocean that depend on sunlight intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], or gut microbial communities of animals that have a seasonal diet, or that hibernate during the winter months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], turnover as a function of season. Similarly, the assembly of the human gut microbiota after birth follows a predictable pattern characterized by the succession of different microbial taxa during the first few months of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Compositional changes associated with the turnover of microbial communities have mostly been studied at the genus- or species-level using 16S rRNA gene analysis. However, natural microbial communities usually harbor a large extent of strain-level diversity, with strains of the same species carrying distinct functions. In the human gut, strain-level differences can influence the metabolism of dietary compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] or drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], or modulate their interactions with the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Moreover, several recent studies have suggested that strains of the same species can exhibit different dynamics and govern the eco-evolutionary dynamics in microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, if natural microbial communities undergo consistent compositional transitions at the strain-level in response to environmental changes is less well understood.</p><p id="P4">Honeybees <italic>(Apis mellifera)</italic> can be useful models for studying strain-level dynamics in host-associated microbial communities. They are eusocial animals that live in large colonies composed of a single queen, a few hundred male bees, and thousands of sterile female worker bees. They harbor a relatively simple, but highly specialized microbial community in their gut, composed of &lt;10 bacterial phylotypes (i.e. bacteria sharing &gt;97% sequence identity in the 16S rRNA gene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Most of these phylotypes have diverged into sequence discrete populations (sequence clusters of &gt;95% ANI; hereafter referred to as species), each harboring a high degree of strain-level diversity and variation in functional gene content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Using shotgun metagenomics, we have previously shown that while phylotypes, and species within phylotypes, co-exist in individual bees, strains within species segregate, suggesting that each worker bee harbors a distinct community at the strain-level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. These differences in strain-level composition could not be attributed to any variation in age, time of sampling, or colony affiliation. However, in our previous study, only a few colonies were sampled, and bees were exclusively sampled from within the hive between September and February (i.e. autumn and winter) raising the possibility that most microbiota samples originated from nurse bees or long-lived winter bees. During the summer months, worker bees undergo an age-related behavioral maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Young nurse bees feed on pollen and fulfill tasks inside the hive related to brood care, nest building, and food processing. However, when 2-3 weeks old nurses transition to forager bees, which feed on honey, and collect pollen and nectar outside the hive. Besides the dramatic change in dietary intake, this behavioral maturation is accompanied by a series of physiological changes, such as endocrine secretion, fat body metabolism, and brain activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Community profiling based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that the nurse-to-forager transition is associated with a consistent change in gut microbiota composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. While the microbiota of both bee types is dominated by the same bacterial phylotypes, the composition of the community shifts with a marked decrease in the absolute abundance of most phylotypes in forager versus nurse bees. Here, we tested if the gut microbiota of honeybees during the transition from nurse to forager bees also undergoes consistent compositional changes at the strain-level. To this end, we analyzed shotgun metagenomics data from nurse and forager bees sampled across 15 colonies in Western Switzerland. Our results show that the two behavioral states harbor distinctive bacterial communities across colonies, characterized by consistent shifts in strain composition and functional gene content of major bacterial species. These findings show that strains are ecologically distinct units that undergo a predictable ecological transition when bees turn from nurses to foragers. We speculate that this microbiota shift is driven by nutrient availability disparities or physiological changes in the gut of foragers relative to nurses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bacterial loads and species-level community composition differ between nurse and forager bees</title><p id="P6">To investigate compositional changes with genomic resolution in the honeybee gut microbiota in response to behavioral state, we collected metagenomic samples from larvae-feeding nurses and pollen foragers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Samples consisted of pooled honeybee guts to ensure representative sampling of the strain-level diversity for each colony. In total, we sampled 15 colonies from five different sampling locations (three each), which allowed us to account for possible variation between sites and colonies, not related to behavioral state.</p><p id="P7">Due to the different dietary habits of the two behavioral states, the hindguts of nurses were usually pollen-filled, as indicated by the enlarged gut size, and the opacity and yellow color of the gut content. In contrast, the hindguts of foragers were smaller and contained mostly nectar based on their translucent appearance. Accordingly, nurse guts were on average 2.9x heavier than their forager counterparts (p=3.3e-09, Wilcoxon sign rank test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To estimate the absolute abundance of bacteria relative to the amount of total DNA in each pooled gut sample, we performed qPCR on genomic DNA targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. This revealed that the bacterial loads in the forager samples were on average 2.6x lower than the ones in the nurse samples (p=1.83e-04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), confirming previous results by Kešnerová et al. (2020).</p><p id="P9">Shotgun metagenomics sequencing resulted in 58.4 – 76.7 million reads per sample. To compare the bacterial community composition of nurses and foragers, the metagenomic reads were mapped to a reference database of isolate genomes of strains from the gut microbiota of social bees, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ellegaard et al. (2020)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ellegaard and Engel (2019)</xref>. The non-redundant database was composed of 198 isolate genomes and encompassed all major community members described to be present in the honeybee gut microbiota. Between 19.8 and 57.4 % of all metagenomic reads mapped to the bacterial reference database. Of the remaining reads, 30.6 - 76.0 % mapped to the host genome of <italic>A. mellifera,</italic> and only 4.2 - 20.8 % of the reads could not be assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Forager samples overall had a lower proportion of reads mapping to the bacterial database than the nurse samples (forager average 35.6%, nurse average 50.8%, p=6.1e-05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), which is in line with the difference in bacterial loads between the two behavioral states. Taxonomic profiling with mOTU2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] revealed that a large fraction of the unmapped reads originated from bacteria, especially from <italic>Bartonella, Snodgrassella,</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> suggesting that some of the diversity of these core microbiota members is not covered in our reference database. However, also some accessory community members were detected among the unmapped reads such as <italic>Hafnia, Klebsiella,</italic> or <italic>Enterobacter,</italic> especially in nurse samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next determined the relative and absolute abundance of the major phylotypes and species in each sample based on the read coverage of single-copy core genes and the total number of 16 rRNA gene copies determined by qPCR. We will refer to different species within phylotypes using the previously established SDP (sequence-discrete population) numbering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], for reasons of readability but also because only for a subset of them proper species names have been established to date. A list with all SDPs and corresponding species names can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Both the phylotype and species-level composition were comparable to the community profiles detected in previous shotgun metagenomic analyses based on individual bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Firmicutes (Bombilactobacilli and Lactobacilli) and Bifidobacteria dominated the community, and for the phylotypes Bombilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Gilliamella, different species were detected in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with previous findings that social bees harbor host-specific communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], most reads mapped to the genomes of bacterial isolates from <italic>A. mellifera.</italic> Only a few reads (0.15% - 3.1%) in nine samples mapped to bacteria from other bee species (including Lactobacilli isolated from <italic>Apis cerana,</italic> and Gilliamella isolated from bumble bees and <italic>Apis cerana,</italic> see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), which may be due to spurious mapping.</p><p id="P11">Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the bacterial relative abundances separated nurse from forager samples at both the phylotype-(PERMANOVA, Host – R<sup>2</sup>=0.40279, p-value=0.001) and the species-level (PERMANOVA, Host - R<sup>2</sup>=0.45201, p-value=0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Samples also clustered by location (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). However, it is important to note that our study was not designed to test for this, as only three colonies were sampled per location with two samples per colony.</p><p id="P12">In terms of absolute abundances (as determined by multiplying the proportions of each community member by the total bacterial biomass in each sample, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref>), most community members were less abundant in foragers than in nurse bees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), a direct consequence of the lower total bacterial biomass present in the gut of foragers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, there were clear differences in the strength of these changes between community members, even among species of the same phylotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). For example, the total abundances of Lactobacilli Firm5_1 and Firm5_4 changed to a lesser extent (average log2 fold change = -1.45 and -0.71) than those of Firm5_2 and Firm5_3 (average log2 fold change = -2.82 and -2.99) in foragers relative to nurses. This explains the consistent shift towards a less even species composition of this phylotype in foragers compared to nurses as determined with the Shannon diversity index (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p-value=8.8e-06, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Likewise, Bifido_1.2 was more affected (average log2 fold change = -2.32) than any of the other species of the Bifidobacterium phylotype (average log2 fold change across species of the Bifidobacterium phylotype = -0.37) by the behavioral state transition of the host (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Notably, four community members (Bapis, Snod_1, Com_1 and Lkun) did not change in absolute bacterial load between nurses and forager samples, suggesting that they are not affected in their abundance by the behavioral transition.</p><p id="P13">In summary, although the gut microbiota of forager and nurse bees were composed of the same community members, we found consistent differences in the absolute abundance of many of them, not only at the phylotype-level as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], but also at the species-level. Moreover, some species of a given phylotype were more strongly affected than others suggesting species-specific responses to the nurse-to-forager transition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Consistent differences in strain-level composition between nurse and forager bees</title><p id="P14">Previous studies have shown that most honeybee gut microbiota species harbor high levels of strain diversity and that the strain composition differs between individual bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. To assess strain-level differences between nurses or foragers, we mapped the metagenomic reads against a reduced reference database containing one genome per species and quantified the number of polymorphic sites in the reads mapped onto the single-copy core genes of these reference genomes.</p><p id="P15">We detected between 1.85 and 11.19% polymorphic sites per species per sample, with Firm4_2 showing the lowest, and Firm5_4 the highest average proportion of polymorphic sites per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These differences in proportions of polymorphic sites among community members are comparable to those previously found by Ellegaard et al. (2020) and Ellegaard and Engel (2019). To assess the total amount of strain-level diversity detected per species across all samples, we calculated cumulative proportions of polymorphic sites as a function of the number of bee samples. Firm4_2 showed the lowest (4.91%) and Bifido1_1 the highest (12.8%) level of total diversity across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In all cases, we observed that the slope of the curves rapidly decreased with the addition of new samples, indicating that many of the polymorphic sites are shared across samples.</p><p id="P16">When comparing the two behavioral states, we found that five of the 17 analyzed species showed higher strain-level diversity in nurses than in foragers (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Firm4_1: q-value=4.20e-3, Firm5_1: q-value=6.45e-3, Firm5_2: q-value=1.08e-2, Firm5_3: q- value=3.56e-4, Gilli_1: q-value=6.45e-3) whereas only two species showed lower strain-level diversity in nurses than in foragers (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Gilli_2: q-value=2.91e-2, Snod_1: q-value=2.91e-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The forager samples had on average 2.6 times lower bacterial load than nurse samples, but on average only 1.5 times smaller number of reads per sample. This means that a larger fraction of the total bacterial population was analyzed for forager relative to nurse samples, a difference that could potentially affect diversity estimates. However, no significant correlation was found between the proportion of polymorphic sites detected and the read coverage of our samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that we had sufficiently deep coverage across the study.</p><p id="P17">Next, we assessed the difference in strain profiles between forager and nurse samples by comparing the distribution of single nucleotide variants (i.e. alleles) at the detected polymorphic sites for each species across samples. To do so, we computed the Jaccard distances between all sample pairs based on the number of shared polymorphic sites. Principal coordinate analysis of these similarity indices resulted in clustering of the samples by host behavioral state for 11 of the 17 analyzed species (PERMANOVA, p-value &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), including all species of Bifido_1 and Firm5, except for Bifido_1.5 and Firm5_4, Firm4_1, Gilli_1, Gilli_2, and Snod_1. Notably, we also observed clustering by location in the principal coordinate analysis (PERMANOVA, p-value &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). However, as already stated before, our study was not designed to test for the effect of location as two samples per location came from the same colony.</p><p id="P18">In summary, our analysis shows that nurse bees and foragers have distinct strain profiles for many bacterial species both in terms of the amount of diversity and type of variants detected.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Intraspecific differences in functional gene content between nurse and forager bees</title><p id="P19">Previous studies have shown that most species of the honeybee gut microbiota harbor large accessory gene pools and that individual bees vary in terms of the functional gene content encoded in a given species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Because nurses and foragers have different physiology and diet, we thus hypothesized that the observed changes in strain-level composition between the two behavioral states may be driven by functional differences among strains.</p><p id="P20">To identify strain-specific genes that may be enriched in one behavioral state or the other, we compared the read coverage of all genes assigned to a given species. Strain-specific genes should have a lower read coverage than the single-copy core genes of a given species; and those that predominate in one behavioral state relative to the other should show a consistent coverage discrepancy between forager and nurse samples. To identify such genes, we assembled all reads not mapping to the host genome and binned the resulting contigs into bacterial species bins using our reference database (see methods for details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Then, we clustered the ORFs encoded in the binned contigs into species-specific ortholog groups (OGs) and identified those OGs that showed consistent coverage discrepancy between forager and nurse samples. In total, 81.7% (65.3 – 90.9% per sample) of all assembled bases could be binned and 83.4% (73.2 – 86.1% per sample) of the non-host reads mapped to the binned contigs indicating that we had included most of the bacterial diversity present in the samples. Out of 45,863 species-specific OGs, 1,551 revealed significant differences between the nurse and forager samples (q-value &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and absolute log2 fold change &gt; 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>), which indicated that these genes were more abundant in one host behavioral state versus the other. Notably, the number of differential abundant OGs substantially varied between species ranging from 15 to 231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). For example, in Bifido_1.1, we detected very few consistent gene content differences between foragers and nurses (6 and 9 OGs, respectively). This species had the highest proportion of polymorphic sites across samples, but showed no clustering of the samples by behavioral state based on the number of shared polymorphic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The largest differences in gene content between nurses and foragers were found for three Lactobacillus Firm5 species (Firm5_2: 184 OGs, Firm5_3: 131 OGs, Firm5_4: 177 OGs), two Gilliamella species (Gilli_1: 64 OGs, Gilli_2: 161 OGs), Snod_1 (197 OGs), and Bifido_1.2 (159 OGs). Consistent with these findings, all of these species, except for Firm5_4, also showed clustering by behavioral state based on the number of shared polymorphic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, a larger fraction of the state-specific OGs were found in foragers than in nurses (in total 1019 versus 445 significantly different OGs, respectively).</p><p id="P21">To determine the functions encoded by the behavioral state-specific gene content, we annotated all OGs using eggnog and used COG categories as a first level of functional characterization. Of all behavioral state-specific OGs, 33.1% had no COG annotation, while 17.3% of them fell into the COG category S (unknown function). For the rest of the significant OGs, we categorized 20.6% of them as metabolism-related, 11.7% as linked to cellular processes, signaling and structure, and 18.3% as information storage and processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Among the significant categorized OGs (excluding COG S), category G (carbohydrate metabolism and transport) was the most important category, representing 11.4% of all significant OGs. However, the proportion of different COG categories contributing to the significant OGs varied between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In case of Firm4_1, COG category H (coenzyme metabolism) was specifically enriched in the behavioral state-specific OGs relative to the total number of OGs per species (Fisher’s Exact test q-value=2.5e-06, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.).</p><p id="P22">Behavioral state-specific OGs of COG category G included many phosphotransferase system genes, in particular in Lactobacillus and Gilliamella species, but also glycoside hydrolases, sugar binding and metabolism proteins. In most species, these OGs were more abundant in foragers relative to nurses, except for Bifido_1.2 and Firm5_3, where the enrichment was in the nurse samples, or spread equally between nurse and forager samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The overrepresentation of the COG category H in Firm4_1 corresponded to 27 OGs involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B12), which had a higher coverage in forager than in nurse samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). In the same species, we also found 18 genes for the utilization of ethanolamine among the OGs enriched in foragers versus nurses. Processing of ethanolamine by the enzyme ammonia-lyase is dependent on adenosylcobalamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To further explore the possible link between the identified cobalamin biosynthesis and ethanolamine utilization OGs, we analyzed the available isolate genomes of Firm4. Homologs of the cobalamin biosynthesis and ethanol utilization pathways were only present in two (Hon2 and ESL0449) of the six Firm4_1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) confirming that these genes are strain-specific. Moreover, the genes of both pathways were encoded in the same genomic island, integrated into a conserved chromosomal region, providing further evidence that they are functionally linked and have likely evolved together.</p><p id="P24">Another interesting set of behavioral state-specific OGs was identified in Gilli_1, Gilli_2, and Snod_1, and encoded various components of Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) involved in interbacterial killing. This included genes annotated as effector proteins with PAAR or RHS domains and immunity proteins. In Gilli_2, several genes encoding the structural components of an entire T6SS were among the behavioral state-specific OGs. They clustered in a genomic island which was present in only one (strain A7) out of 17 strains of Gilli_2 in our reference database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Strikingly, all these behavioral state-specific T6SS-related OGs were more abundant in forager than in nurse samples.</p><p id="P25">In Snod_1, we also found other surface structure-related functions than T6SS among the behavioral state-specific OGs, including genes encoding major subunits of Type IV pili, RTX toxins, and proteins involved in capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">There is accumulating evidence that natural microbial communities harbor high extent of strain-level diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].

Our results show that a radical shift in host lifestyle can change the strain composition of a large fraction of the gut microbiota, demonstrating that strains represent ecological distinct units and emphasizing the importance to study diversity in host-microbe associations at the strain level.</p><p id="P29">Previous shotgun metagenomics studies have linked variation in species- and strain-level diversity in the gut microbiota to host traits, such as age, colony origin, or genotype, but not to behavioral state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Some of these studies analyzed individual bees while others focused on pooled gut samples. In the current work, we analyzed pooled samples of 20 bees rather than individual bees. The advantage of pooling is that a larger number of colonies can be surveyed, increasing the statistical power of the study. However, pooling precludes the detection of variants present at low prevalence across the sampled bees explaining the overall lower levels of polymorphic sites observed in our as compared previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, rare strains have likely a minor impact on the whole community or the host.</p><p id="P30">Another possible limitation of our study is that the sampled nurse and forager bees were not age-matched. As foragers are usually older than nurses, age could have been a confounding factor in our study. However, our previous findings have shown that the age of bees has little impact on the strain level composition of the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Therefore, we are confident that most of the observed differences are due to the nurse to forager transition and the associated changes in dietary intake, physicochemical gut conditions, or host physiology.</p><p id="P31">In contrast to nurses, foragers do not consume pollen. This is likely the reason why foragers were found to harbor lower bacterial biomass in the gut than nurses and exhibit a consistent decrease of Bombilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium relative to the other phylotypes. This was already reported by two previous studies based on 16S rRNA gene analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], one of which used age-matched forager and nurse bees, corroborating the results of our shotgun metagenomics analyses. Pollen constitutes an important nutrient source for bee gut-associated Bombilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium explaining their decrease in absolute abundance. All three phylotypes harbor genes to degrade pollen-derived carbohydrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], and they readily grow in minimal media supplement with pollen extract or entire pollen grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Moreover, experimentally colonized bees kept on a sugar water diet harbor substantially fewer bacteria of these phylotypes in their gut than bees that also receive pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P32">As previous studies were based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, their analyses were limited to the phylotype level. Hence, a key finding of our study is that not only phylotypes, but also closely related species within phylotypes, and even different strains of the same species respond differently to the nurse-to-forager transition. For example, one species of Lactobacillus Firm5 was similar in total abundance between foragers and nurses, while others significantly differed significantly (&gt;8 times). Likewise, some species showed consistent changes in strain composition between nurses and foragers, while others did not. This suggests that some species and strains are more successful than others in thriving in the gut environment of one state versus the other. Reasons underlying these differences can be manifold. Some species and strains may be adapted to utilize specific pollen compounds and hence have an advantage in the nurse gut. Others may not depend on pollen nutrients for growth that much; or may be better in withstanding physicochemical changes in the gut as bees transition from one state to the other, explaining why they persist in the forager gut. Also, the fact that we find changes in strain-level diversity in opposite directions between the two host states suggests that different ecological processes are at play in different species. For example, in one species, the reduced nutrient availability in the forager gut may hinder strains to overgrow and dominate the community, resulting in decreased total abundance but increased strain-level diversity in foragers. For another species, the nutrient-rich pollen diet may expand ecological niches or open new ones that can be colonized by functionally divergent strains explaining the observed increase in strain-level diversity in nurses relative to foragers.</p><p id="P33">If the observed shifts in strain composition were due to changes in the ecological niches in the gut, we would expect to find functional differences between strains of the same species dominating in nurses versus foragers. Previous studies have successfully identified such condition-specific genes within host-associated bacterial species by comparing metagenomic datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. For example, strains of the human gut symbiont <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>harbored distinct gene repertoires for drug metabolism and complex carbohydrate degradation in Western and non-Western individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Likewise, strains of an intracellular symbiont of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> deep-sea mussels showed substantial variation in gene content for nutrient and energy acquisition indicating adaptation to the local conditions present in the environment they were sampled from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P34">We detected strain-specific gene sets (i.e. OGs) associated with one of the two behavioral states in almost all species of the gut microbiota. Carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions were prevalent among the behavioral state-specific gene content, which was somehow expected as most species carry large accessory gene sets of this functional category in their genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that carbohydrate transport and metabolism are important for niche partitioning of diet-derived carbohydrates in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and that many of these genes are differentially expressed when bees are fed pollen as compared to sugar water as diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Somewhat more surprising was the finding that vitamin B12 biosynthesis and ethanolamine utilization genes of Bombilactobacillus were specifically enriched in foragers versus nurses. Some of these genes have already been found to be variably present among individual bees in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], but they could not be linked to any host differences. Vitamin B12 is an important co-factor that cannot be synthesized by honeybees (or other animals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], but needs to be taken up from the diet or synthesized by bacterial symbionts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. It is possible that Bombilactobacillus strains synthesizing this vitamin compensate the lack of vitamin B12 in the pollen-deprived diet of foragers. However, a more plausible explanation for the increased abundance of these genes in foragers may be that vitamin B12 is an essential co-factor for a major enzyme of the ethanolamine utilization pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Ethanolamine is derived from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine and constitutes an important bacterial nitrogen and carbon source in the animal gut due to the high turnover of the host epithelium and the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. It is possible that ethanolamine accumulates in the forager gut due to the presence of dead bacterial material or increased epithelial shedding, providing a behavioral state-specific nutrient niche for the gut microbiota. The fact that the genes for utilizing ethanolamine are strain-specific indicates that they are costly to maintain, and that host state-specific nutritional niches may contribute to the maintenance of strain-level diversity in the gut microbiota.</p><p id="P36">We also found genes mediating bacteria-host interactions and interbacterial killing among the behavioral state specific gene content. Of particular interest was the finding of several T6SS genes associated with foragers in two of the three Gilliamella species and in Snodgrassella. The primary niche of these bacteria is the ileum, where they form multispecies biofilms on the host epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Diverse T6SS gene repertoires have been identified in almost all sequenced strains of Gilliamella and Snodgrassella indicating that they play key roles in interbacterial competition and niche establishment for these bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Our findings suggest that the forager gut environment selects for strains with expanded capabilities in interbacterial warfare, possibly as a consequence of the increased competition for nutrients and space. In Snodgrassella, we also found genes encoding other surface structures (Type IV pili, LPS modifying enzymes, RTX toxins) to be enriched in either nurses or foragers. Some of these genes are known colonization factors of Snodgrassella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], likely because they enable host attachment and biofilm formation. However, why these functions are specifically enriched in in one of the two behavioral states remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P37">In summary, using shotgun metagenomics analysis we show that the gut microbiota of honeybees undergoes consistent shifts in strain-level diversity when bees transition between two major behavioral states (i.e. from nurses to foragers). These strain-level differences are associated with changes in intraspecific gene content of several bacterial species suggesting adaptation to host state-specific niches. The possibility to carry out gnotobiotic bee experiments provides excellent opportunities for future research to probe the functional relevance of the link between strain-specific gene content and host state. Since the association of social bees with their microbiota is evolutionary ancient, it will also be interesting to expand these analyses to closely related bee species which show similar division of labor and whose microbiota has diversified to similar extents as in <italic>A. mellifera.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Sampling</title><p id="P38">Adult female worker bees of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> were collected over the Summer 2019 from 15 different colonies in 5 different locations across Western Switzerland (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

R2 values were adjusted using the function adonisOmegaSq implemented in the MicEco package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Russel88/MicEco">https://github.com/Russel88/MicEco</ext-link>, commit 91f8e6f).</p><p id="P56">We generated all plots using R and the following R libraries: ggplot2 (v3.3.6), reshape (v0.8.9), gridExtra (v2.3), ggrepel (v0.9.1), RColorBrewer (v1.1-3) and scales (v1.2.1) and in python (v3.10.11) using the package matplotlib (v3.7.1) and seaborn (v0.12.2). Figures have been generated using Inkscape (v1.1) or Adobe Illustrator.
