Multi-sequence alignment analyses of SCoV2 Wuhan RBD and four strains each from FCoV serotypes 1 and 2 (FCoV1, FCoV2) demonstrated amino acid sequence identity of 11.5% and similarity of 31.8% with FCoV1 RBD, as well as 12.2% identity and 36.5% similarity for FCoV2 RBD. The sera from all three toms and three mated queens cross-reacted with SCoV2 RBD and reacted with FCoV1 RBD and FCoV2 spike-2, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins of FCoV2 whole-virus, but not with FCoV2 RBD. Additionally, the plasma from all six FCoV2-inoculated laboratory cats reacted with FCoV2 and SCoV2 RBDs, but not with FCoV1 RBD. In another study, eight group-housed laboratory cats from a different lineage had a range of serum cross-reactivity to SCoV2 RBD even 15 months later. Such cross-reactivity was also observed in FCoV1-positive group-housed pet cats. The SCoV2 RBD at a high non-toxic dose and FCoV2 RBD at a 60-400-fold lower dose blocked the <italic>in vitro</italic> FCoV2 infection of the feline cells, demonstrating their close structural conformations essential as vaccine immunogens. Furthermore, such cross-reactivity to SCoV2 RBD was also detected by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both transient and chronically FCoV1-infected cats. Overall, the cross-reactivity with SCoV2 RBD by the sera from both serotypes of FCoV-infected cats also suggests that the cross-reactive epitope(s) on FCoV1 and FCoV2 RBDs may be similar to those of SCoV2 RBD and provides essential insights to developing a pan-CoV vaccine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The global prevalence of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection ranges from 6.6%-95% in multi-cat households and catteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. FCoV is distributed into two phylogenic lineages of serotypes 1 and 2 (FCoV1, FCoV2). Both serotype FCoVs infect predominantly epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and cause a mild gastrointestinal disease (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, and transient weight loss) in domestic cats, especially in kittens. Often, upon chronic infection, these viruses can also mutate into pathogenic and fatal variants. These variants, called feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs), infect monocytes and macrophages, spreading throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. No known cases of FCoV infection in humans have been reported. However, the FCoV sequence sections have been found in recombinant coronaviruses infecting humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In comparison, many cases of SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) infection of pet cats have been reported worldwide through transmission from COVID-19-positive owners to their pet cats. These cats displayed mild symptoms or remained asymptomatic, even when found positive for SCoV2 by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Experimental inoculation of laboratory cats with a human isolate of SCoV2 caused infection, ranging from mild to asymptomatic symptoms. These infected cats were diagnosed as RT-PCR positive through nasal and/or fecal swabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. SCoV2 transmission from inoculated cats to non-inoculated cats through contact exposure has been demonstrated by multiple research groups worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Similarly, transmissions of SCoV2 from COVID-19-positive owners to their symptomatic and asymptomatic pet dogs have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Experimental infection of laboratory dogs also confirmed that dogs could be infected with SCoV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Studies have shown that FCoV-infected cats develop antibodies that cross-react with SARS-CoV1 (SCoV1) nucleocapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] but not with SCoV1 spike 1 (S1) glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], where the SCoV1 receptor binding region (RBD) is located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. SCoV1 infection in humans was first discovered in November 2002 in a patient with atypical pneumonia in Guangdong, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. By February 2003, this virus was rapidly transmitted to a large population in Hong Kong, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The intermediate host for SCoV1 was suspected to be a masked palm civet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. SCoV1 preparation isolated from a patient, was inoculated intratracheally into six laboratory cats. This resulted in asymptomatic infection in all four cats, based on positive virus isolation and viral RT-PCR of the pharynx, trachea, and lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, two non-inoculated cats housed together with the SCoV1 inoculated cats became PCR positive starting day 2 of contact exposure with a peak titer at day 6. By day 28, they had seroconverted with a virus-neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer of 40 and 160. One pet cat living in an apartment block with over 100 residents positive for SCoV1 was also positive for SCoV1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Both SCoV1 and SCoV2 belong to genus Betacoronavirus of family Coronaviridae, while FCoV1 and FCoV2 belong to genus Alphacoronavirus based on phylogenetic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Both SCoV1 and SCoV2 RBDs bind with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) to infect hACE2-expressing human cells and serving as the major target of the NAbs generated by the infected hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. In contrast, neither FCoV1 nor FCoV2 use ACE2 as their host cell receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The cell receptors for FCoV2 and canine coronavirus serotype 2 (CCoV2) are reported to be feline and canine aminopeptidase-N (fAPN and cAPN), respectively, which is like the human cold Alphacoronavirus (HCCoV) 229E, using human APN (hAPN) as its primary cell receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The cell receptor for FCoV1 is still unknown and this is complicated by the fact that FCoV1 isolates do not readily replicate in cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. FCoV1 infection is more prevalent worldwide, including the US, while the FCoV2 infection is found predominantly in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. FCoV2 is reported to be a recombinant FCoV1 backbone with CCoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Since hACE2 is the major cell receptor for SCoV2, SCoV2 infections of cats and dogs are reported to be mediated by the feline ACE2 (fACE2) and canine ACE2 (cACE2), respectively, based on their amino acid (aa) sequence similarity of fACE2 and cACE2 to hACE2 and the binding analyses of SCoV2 to species-specific ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The aa sequence comparison between SCoV1 and SCoV2 S proteins demonstrates a considerably high sequence identity of 76%, and their RBDs similarly show a high sequence identity of 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Hence, the aa sequence similarity should be much higher. Since the sera from FCoV1 and FCoV2 infected cats cross-react with SCoV1 nucleocapsid but not with SCoV1 S1 glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], it can be inferred from those reports that sera from FCoV1 and FCoV2 infected cats can cross-react with SCoV2 nucleocapsid but not with SCoV2 S1 glycoprotein, and, consequently, not with the SCoV2 RBD which resides on S1 glycoprotein. Furthermore, a few aa sequence analysis studies demonstrate that the Wuhan SCoV2 S glycoprotein is distinctly different from S glycoproteins of FCoV1 and FCoV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The location for FCoV1 and FCoV2 RBDs has yet to be determined by biological analysis, but it has recently been predicted to be around residues 526-676, based on RBD sequence locations of porcine enteric diarrhea virus (PEDV) RBD at B residues 510-640 and transmissible gastrointestinal enteric virus (TGEV) RBD at D3 residues 500-651 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The TGEV RBD has been reported to bind to the porcine APN as its primary host cell receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], but whether PEDV RBD binds to pAPN as its host cell receptor is still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The RBD sequence prediction of both PEDV and TGEV was based on monoclonal Ab (MAb) studies, identifying the most potent neutralizing MAb(s) to these porcine Alphacoronaviruses reacting to B and D3 residue regions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Although neutralizing MAb (nMAb) studies have been performed against FCoV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], the location and the native conformation of FCoV1 and FCoV2 RBDs have yet to be clearly defined and confirmed by biological analyses required for use as vaccine immunogens.</p><p id="P7">Our laboratory has recently discovered that, shortly after specific pathogen-free (SPF) toms mated with FCoV-positive queens, they developed minor episode(s) of diarrhea with only low production of FCoV antibodies (Abs) but unexpectedly high levels of cross-reactive Abs to human SCoV2 RBD. Consequently, as a confirmation of the original finding, these sera from FCoV infected cats were tested for their cross-reactivity to SCoV2 RBD by more stringent ELISA, immunoblot analyses, SCoV2 RBD blocking assay, and SCoV2 RBD stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Lastly, we further characterized the nature of FCoV transmission in cats at inducing cross-reacting Abs to SCoV2 RBD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Initial serological studies in FCoV naturally infected laboratory cats</title><sec id="S4"><title>FCoV whole-virus (WV) ELISA and SCoV2 ELISA with overnight serum incubation</title><p id="P8">Our studies on FCoV were initiated when four laboratory queens donated by the University of Georgia (UGA) were mated with three SPF inbred toms from our laboratory at the University of Florida (UF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The four juvenile laboratory cats born from two UGA queens (UGAQ3, UGAQ4) had FCoV Abs at 12 and 16 weeks of age based on FCoV2-WV ELISA. The UGA queens were all seropositive for FCoV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>), and the sera from the toms, after mating, were weakly seropositive for FCoV2 but had no neutralizing Abs (NAbs) to FCoV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Since these juvenile cats were to be used for a SCoV2 inoculation study at UGA, their serum was collected before shipment to UGA and tested by SCoV2 RBD ELISA. Three of the four juvenile cats had a serum that cross-reacted moderately with the SCoV2 RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Stringent FCoV-WV ELISA and SCoV2 RBD ELISA</title><p id="P9">The sera from all four UGA queens and three toms were incubated at the same dilution for only one hour instead of overnight, and PBS was used instead of bicarbonate buffer for coating of the antigen on the ELISA plate. In addition, ELISA with bovine serum albumin (BSA) antigen was included since the UGA queens were vaccinated three years ago with commercial vaccines. The veterinary vaccines were often contaminated with BSA. This BSA control was also important because the FCoV2-WV preparation contained about 5% BSA, whereas the RBDs were highly purified and devoid of BSA. Two UGA queens (UGAQ1, UGAQ4) had high levels of serum reactivity with FCoV but without any reactivity with BSA and SCoV2 RBDs, while the other two queens (UGAQ2, UGAQ3) had high serum reactivities with FCoV, which were slightly higher than the serum reactivities with BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). The sera from UGAQ2 also had substantial cross-reactivities with both SCoV2 RBDs (UF and MassBiologics (MB) RBDs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A Fig</xref>), whereas the sera from UGAQ3 had a modest cross-reactivity with MB-RBD and below the threshold cross-reactivity with UF-RBD. All UGA queens were group housed together upon arrival on Oct. 25, 2019. The earliest serum collected from the queens was on Dec. 19, 2019 from UGAQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Hence, they were most likely infected with FCoV, instead of SCoV2 and not from contact with a COVID-19-positive animal caretaker, since the first case of COVID-19 in Florida was reported on March 2, 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The serum collected from 5HQT1 on Jan. 29, 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>; Post-2 mo) cross-reacting with SCoV2 RBD supports FCoV infection, based on the date of the first Florida cases.</p><p id="P10">As expected, the sera from all toms before mating had no reactivity with FCoV, both UF/MB-RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>), and BSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B Fig</xref>). However, post-mating sera from all toms had significant reactivity with SCoV2 RBDs but not with FCoV, compared to the corresponding pre-mating control results. The highest titers to SCoV2 RBDs were observed at the earliest timepoint of serum collection closest to the first exposure to the FCoV-positive queen. Subsequent sera showed declines that were still significantly different from the pre-serum titers (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; pre- and post-exposure paired T-test). The decline suggested that the development of cross-reactive Abs to SCoV2 RBD could have occurred during active FCoV infection. A slight conflict was observed between the substantial reactivity with FCoV for the toms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>) and no reactivity with FCoV for the toms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). This may be due to the technical difference as detailed above. Overall, the stringent ELISA confirmed the sera from all three toms cross-reacted strongly with SCoV2 RBD. Only one long-term FCoV-infected queen UGAQ2 also had a high titer of cross-reactive Abs to SCoV2 RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The lack of S1 and RBD aa sequence identity/similarity between SCoV2 and FCoVs</title><sec id="S7"><title>Sequence analyses of SCoV2 and FCoV structural proteins</title><p id="P11">The aa sequence comparison between Wuhan SCoV2 <italic>versus</italic> FCoV1 and between SCoV2 <italic>versus</italic> FCoV2 demonstrated SCoV2 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane) were shorter than FCoV1 and FCoV2, with the exception of nucleocapsid protein and S2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A Fig</xref>). The least aa identity and similarity were observed between SCoV2 and FCoV1/FCoV2 at the S1 glycoprotein among the five structural proteins composing these viruses. The aa sequence identity and similarity between S1 glycoproteins of SCoV2 and FCoV1 had 13.0% and 40%, respectively, whereas, between SCoV2 and FCoV2, 16.3% and 43.4%. When comparing the cleavage sites separating S1/S2 among SCoV2, FCoV1 and FCoV2, SCoV2 S1/S2 cleavage site appears closer to the FCoV1 S1/S2 cleavage site than that of FCoV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. In contrast, the S2 glycoprotein between SCoV2 and FCoV1/FCoV2 had the highest aa identity of 30.0% and 33.5% with the second highest similarity of 62.2% and 64.5%, respectively, among all structural proteins. Hence, S1 glycoprotein was the most distinctly different structural protein between SCoV2 and FCoV1/FCoV2 among all five structural proteins.</p><p id="P12">When FCoV1 and FCoV2 spike glycoprotein sequences were compared, the S1 glycoprotein sequence had 29.5% and 31.6% identity and 62.9% and 64.5% similarity, which were much lower than the S2 sequence that had 60.6% and 68.7% identity and 84.0% and 89.9% similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A Fig</xref>). The S1/S2 cleavage site for the FCoV2 is proposed to be at the S2’ cleavage site (another cleavage site on S2 glycoprotein) next to the fusion peptide because S1/S2 cleavage motif is absent in the location usually observed for FCoV1 and other coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Note that most coronaviruses, including SCoV2 and FCoV1, have the S2’ cleavage site, but, for brevity, only S1/S2 cleavage site results were used in our analysis. The difference in the aa sequence between FCoV1 and FCoV2 at the envelope (Env), NC, and M ranged from 92.8%-96.3% identity and 97.6%-98.5% similarity, which demonstrated the high conservation between FCoV1 and FCoV2 for those structural proteins. The molecular weight (MW) of the structure proteins without glycosylation was predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B Fig</xref>) to analyze FCoV2-WV immunoblot described later.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Sequence analyses of SCoV2 and FCoV RBDs</title><p id="P13">Next, the Wuhan RBDs of UF and MB were aligned with four known FCoV1 S1 sequences and another set with four known FCoV2 S1 sequences using Clustal O (1.2.1) multiple sequence alignment of JustBio alignment server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://justbio.com/">https://justbio.com/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). The goal of this alignment analysis was to identify the potential FCoV1 and FCoV2 RBD sites for use as the vaccine immunogens. Our logic for using such a comparison is based on the fact that species-specific ACE2 is used by SCoV2 to infect cats, dogs, and humans. The Wuhan SCoV2 RBD sequence is distinctly different in aa sequence from the RBD sequences of FCoV1 (11.5% &amp; 12.3% identity; 31.8% &amp; 33.6% similarity) and FCoV2 (12.2% &amp; 12.3% identity; 36.5% &amp; 37.7% similarity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). The first value is based on UF-RBD, and the second value is based on MB-RBD.

This observation suggests that not all FCoV1-infected cats develop cross-reactive Abs to SCoV2 RBD or the timing of the plasma collection was possibly too late (60 days post-inoculation). These factors, combined with a) low virus inoculation dose (1-mL/cat of 1 TCID<sub>50</sub>), b) oral/nasal inoculation route, and/or c) low S1/RBD immunogenicity of the infection may have contributed to the lack of SCoV2 RBD cross-reactivity, similar to the lack/loss of cross-reactivity of UGAQ1 and UGAQ3 sera to SCoV2 RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The fact that our immunoblots are developed under reducing conditions supports our contention that the cross-reacting epitopes on SCoV2 RBD are either linear aa epitopes and/or glycosylated epitope(s).

Although these cats were unrelated to our inbred cats, SCoV2 RBD cross-reacting Abs developed in laboratory cats purchased from the same commercial cat vendor as the UGA queens, but of different cat lineages.

Group-housing appears to sustain the FCoV infection by reinfection without clinical episode. Our preliminary results indicate that FCoV1-infected pet cats in the field possess cross-reactive Abs to SCoV2 RBD without manifesting clinical signs. These observations may also explain why only some SCoV2-infected pet cats display clinical signs while others remain asymptomatic.

Pfizer SCoV2 RBD mRNA vaccine was not as effective as their S mRNA vaccine perhaps due to the shorter RBD sequence and the T4 foldon used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].</p><p id="P31">The ability of FCoV2 and SCoV2 RBDs to block <italic>in vitro</italic> FCoV2 infection and also induce pan-CoV-specific T-cell responses suggest that these RBDs may be important for developing an effective pan-coronavirus vaccine for pet animals such as cats, dogs, and hamsters. SCoV2 infected hamsters from Europe imported to pet shops in Hong Kong have been reported as a source of two separate hamster-to-human transmissions and subsequent human-to-human transmission of SCoV2 Delta variant, with the sequence found predominantly in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].

This individual was diagnosed with a coronavirus infection resembling a recombinant of predominantly CCoV with sequences similar to CCoV-HuPn-2018. The CCoV-HuPn-2018 appears to be a recombinant of FCoV2 and CCoV isolated from a patient with pneumonia in East Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Based on these findings, pan-CoV vaccine that prevents active FCoV and CCoV infections of cats and dogs will indirectly prevent infection of humans, which is another vital role of such a vaccine.</p><p id="P32">Besides the profound acute severe respiratory syndrome, SCoV2 infection in humans causes gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain), including longer fecal shedding than those detected in the nasopharyngeal samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>].

The high sequence similarity between FCoV2 and CCoV2 RBDs may explain why CCoV2 can infect fAPN expressing feline cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Although FCoV1 and CCoV1 RBDs possess only aa sequence identity of 55.5%, their sequence similarity of 80.8% is remarkably high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9 Fig</xref>), suggesting that they have a common lineage with evolutionary changes and perhaps also by sectional recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Since FCoV infection remained in domestic cats for over three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], the FCoV RBDs must have endured the evolutionary pressure and are unlikely to undergo further mutations at RBD to retain its infectivity. Based on these findings, we propose that pan-CoV vaccine against SCoV2 infection in cats, dogs, and hamsters can be developed by combining FCoV1 RBD (gp52) and FCoV2 RBD (gp59) together with a larger SCoV2 RBD (gp40) for stability, potentially without addition of CCoV1/CCoV2 RBDs. However, the addition of conserved pan-CoV CTL epitopes from highly conserved SCoV2/FCoV protein(s) (e.g., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with minimal mutations among SCoV2 variants) to the triple-RBDs may be required to induce sterilizing immunity (i.e., immunity against infection) in the vaccinated animals. Such pan-CoV vaccine tested in laboratory cats may provide insights on how to develop sterilizing immunity against SCoV2 in humans, while also preventing future zoonotic variant infections and benefiting companion animals.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Animal populations</title><p id="P34">The studies used laboratory cats that were bred and cared for under the UF IACUC protocols 200801838 through 202001838, and the sera from pet cats collected under IACUC protocol 201803990.

The infected culture fluids directly from the culture flask (175 cm) were pooled and clarified free of cell debris by low-speed centrifugation at 2800-3000 rpm for 45 min at 5°C. In addition, the freeze-thawed culture fluids from the frozen flasks with residual media were pooled and then clarified free of cell debris by low-speed centrifugation. They were then combined with a portion of the clarified culture fluid from above, from one part clarified direct culture fluid to two parts of clarified cell-debris fluid. The following two methods partially purified both direct and combined clarified fluids. In the first method, the combined clarified fluid was directly concentrated to 10-50 fold by Vivaspin 20 Centrifugal Concentrators (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) with PES membrane of 100k MW cut off. The concentrated virus fluid underwent an additional 4-6 washes with PBS using the Centrifugal Concentrator until the phenol red from the culture media was faintly pink in color. This method resulted in a preparation that had a reasonably high FCoV2 load (1.2 mg/mL) with detectable levels of 180 kDa S glycoprotein but almost undetectable BSA (67 kDa). This preparation was used for developing immunoblot strips. The second method consisted of direct concentration of direct-clarified fluid using multiple Centrifugal Concentrators with minimal PBS washes. As a result, this preparation retained the phenol red color and about 5% residual BSA from FBS. This method provided a virus preparation at a high concentration (150 mg/mL), needed for use in screening a large number of cat sera with FCoV2-WV ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Transfection and expression of Expi293F Cells with RBD plasmids and purification of RBD proteins</title><p id="P38">The plasmids pVRC containing human codon-optimized RBD constructs were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using the ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).

Summary</title></caption><p>To date, there are no reports on the sera from feline coronavirus (FCoV)-infected cats cross-reacting with either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV2 (SCoV2) receptor binding domains (RBDs). This report describes the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to SCoV2 RBD in the sera of FCoV-infected laboratory cats, even though SCoV2 RBD and each FCoV serotype (FCoV1, FCoV2) RBD had minimal sequence similarity. However, this observation of serum cross-reactivity to SCoV2 RBD was confirmed by more stringent antibody-based assays and viral assays. Furthermore, both serotypes of FCoV-infected cats, including FCoV1-infected pet cats, produced the cross-reactive antibodies, and such cross-reactivity to SCoV2 RBD was also detected, most likely, by the T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both transient and chronically FCoV1-infected cats. Since SCoV2 RBD is essential component for current vaccines against COVID-19 disease, our findings should provide essential insights to developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that induces full-scale immunity to completely prevent SCoV2 infection in humans and pet animals.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Serum Ab reactivity of the FCoV-positive cats to FCoV2 whole-virus and SCoV2 RBD antigens by ELISA.</title><p>Four queens (UGAQ1, UGAQ2, UGAQ3, UGAQ4) were mated at UF with three SPF toms (5HQT1, HOJT2, HOGT3). In the first harem breeding cycle (A), only two of the four queens (UGAQ3, UGAQ4) successfully mated with two different toms (5HQT1, HOJT2) gave birth to kittens. Queen UGAQ3 mated with 5HQT1 and gave birth to Y2B (A), and their bars are represented with slashes (B,C). Queen UGAQ4 mated with HOJT2 and gave birth to D4A, D4D, D4F, and D4B (A), and the bars of D4A, D4D, and D4F are represented with small dots (B,C). At the time of first blood collection, these kittens were juvenile cats at 16 weeks old for D4A, D4D, and D4F and 12 weeks old for Y2B (A). The open bars are the two queens UGAQ1 and UGAQ2 (B,C) that were also harem mated with toms 5HQT1 and HOJT2 respectively but did not give birth to kittens in the first mating as well as in the pair mating for UGAQ2 (A). The serum from FCoV2-seropositive cat UGA1.4 (B) and SCoV2 inoculated cat UGA4.1 (C) were used as positive control serum. The serum from SPF cats HOE (B) and BDN (C) were used as negative control serum. The FCoV2 NAb titers shown below the cat identification code (B) were those measured at first arrival for queens and post-first mating for toms. FCoV2 NAb assays were performed thrice for repeatability. The sera from the later timepoints described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref> were tested twice and had no detectable NAbs (data not shown). Additionally, the serum Ab cross-reactivity of four FCoV<sup>+</sup> queens (D) at post-UF arrival in months (mo) and three toms (E) at pre-mating and post-first mating with the FCoV<sup>+</sup> queens was tested by stringent ELISA. Their sera were tested for reactivity to FCoV2-WV (grey bar), SCoV2 UF-RBD (light blue bar), SCoV2 MB-RBD (blue bar), and BSA (white bar). Significant difference between the pre-mating and post mating sera of the respective bars are shown as p&lt;0.05 (*) or p&lt;0.005 (**) (E). The serum from SPF cat HOE was used as a negative control for all three antigens (D,E). The same sera from the toms tested negative for anti-BSA Ab titers before this set of ELISA assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B Fig</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157632-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Amino acid (aa) sequence alignment of SCoV2 Wuhan RBD along with proposed FCoV1 RBD (A) and with proposed FCoV2 RBD (B) using multi-alignment analysis with four FCoV strains. In order to prevent one strain anomaly, four strains of FCoV1 (A) were aligned with SCoV2 Wuhan RBD by Clustal Omega 1.2.1 of JustBio Server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://justbio.com/">https://justbio.com/</ext-link>). The SCoV2 Wuhan RBD sequence is shown at the top in blue, and the SCoV2 receptor binding motif (RBM) is underlined. Magenta-colored RBD sequence belongs to the proposed FCoV1 UCD-1 RBD sequence (<italic>A</italic>, second FCoV1 sequence) and the proposed FCoV2 79-1146 RBD sequence (B, fourth FCoV2 sequence). The blue-labeled residues below the MB-RBD bracket represent the MassBiologic’s SCoV2 RBD with the extra 12 residues. The identical and similar aa residues are shown with an asterisk (*) for complete identity, strong similarity with a colon (:), and modest similarity with a single dot (.). The gaps are shown with a dash (-). The aa sequence identity and similarity for UF-RBD (without carboxyl-end 12 aa residues) and MB-RBD sequences are summarized (C), starting with arginine (R) on the amino-end of SCoV2 pointed downward with a red arrow and ending with an upward red arrow, with the number of aa for UF-RBD or MB-RBD with gaps. Next, the proposed FCoV1 UCD-1 RBD sequence (aa residues 406-684) and the proposed FCoV2 79-1146 RBD sequence (aa residues 408-675) were aligned similarly using JustBio Server (D). The bolded, underlined sections represent potential RBM regions, based on counterpart SCoV2 RBM regions in Figures S2 for FCoV2 79-1146 and S3 for FCoV1 UCD-1. The FCoV1 UCD-1 RBD has three N-glycosylation sites with a high prediction as shown with bolded red <bold><styled-content style="color:#C00000">N</styled-content></bold> and no O-glycosylation, based on the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server and NetOGlyc 4.1 Server, respectively (network address in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> legend). FCoV2 79-1146 RBD has four predicted N-glycosylation sites (<bold><styled-content style="color:#C00000">N</styled-content></bold>), shown in bold red, and one O-glycosylation site in bold bright-blue (<bold>T</bold>). The aa sequence identity and similarity between the two RBD sequences are summarized (E), starting with asparagine (N) with a start arrow and ending with an end arrow. The six color coded symbols below the FCoV2 79-1146 sequence represent six nMAbs identified by Kida <italic>et al.</italic> in blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and Corapi <italic>et al.</italic> in red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and these nMAbs were produced using FCoV2 79-1146. The three nMAbs of Kida <italic>et al.</italic> do not cross-neutralize FCoV1 virus (T. Hohdatsu, coauthor of this article and reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157632-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Immunoblot analyses of the sera from FCoV<sup>+</sup> queens and SCoV2 RBD-positive toms followed by MW analyses of the RBDs.</title><p>Immunoblots were developed to the SCoV2 UF-RBD (A), the proposed FCoV2 RBD (B), the cross-reactive FCoV2-WV (C), and the proposed FCoV1 RBD (D). Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref>, the time of serum collection from four FCoV<sup>+</sup> queens are shown as time post arrival to UF, and those from the toms are shown as time post-first exposure to a FCoV<sup>+</sup> queen. The MW size range for the RBD bands SCoV2, FCoV2, and FCoV1 are shown next to the control bands. The bands for FCoV2 structural proteins in FCoV2-WV immunoblot (C) are 43 kDa for NC (long arrow), 28-32 kDa for M (long arrow), and 80-90 kDa for spike-2 glycoprotein (S2) (arrow head). The 190 kDa band (short arrow) in the FCoV2-WV immunoblot strips is the S glycoprotein confirmed by a cross-reactivity analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) to SCoV2 S2 (Sigma ABF1063) and to SCoV2 S (Sigma ABF1066) which cross-reacted with FCoV2 S2 and S, respectively (E1). The rabbit pAb to SCoV2 S1 (Sigma ABF1065) did not cross-react with FCoV2 S1 on immunoblot. Consequently, it served as rabbit control pAb to detect non-specific trapping of the rabbit pAb to the FCoV2 S2 band which had the highest antigen load on the immunoblot. The same analysis was performed at three serum dilutions for UGAQ4 and three toms (HOJT2, HOGT3, 5HQT1), with UGAQ2 only at 1:1000 using the immunoblot of the same batch (E2). All immunoblot photographs were adjusted for consistency to 10% brightness and 5% contrast. The actual MW of the RBDs used in the immunoblot analyses was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of RBD gel (F) and Penta-His MAb treated RBD immunoblot (G). The SCoV2 UF-RBD, FCoV1 RBD, and FCoV2 RBD used the same plasmid with cleavage site peptide and two tags (70 aa with MW of 7,454 Da) attached on the carboxyl-end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). The SCoV2 MB-RBD had c-Myc peptide tag and 6x His Tag (16 aa with MW of 1202 Da) besides the additional 12 aa extension of the RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). The predicted MW without attachment (w/o Tag) (F), predicted MW without Tag and glycan (G) and the predicted glycan MW (G) are shown. The blue arrows represent the location of the peptide band within the major glycosylation band (F). The red arrow points to the sharp thin glycosylated band (F), which is an extremely thin peptide line indicated by a red arrow in the immunoblot (G). These results highlighted with the red arrows together with the thin glycosylated band immediately above the major glycosylated peptide band in panel D indicate that FCoV1 infected cats develop antibodies also to the glycosylation component of the RBD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157632-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>The <italic>in vitro</italic> FCoV2 infection blocking activity of the proposed FCoV2 RBD and the SCoV2 RBD followed by the immunoblot analyses of the sera from FCoV-inoculated cats.</title><p>In Plate A (A), the lanes consisted of media control without virus (rows 2-8, lane 1), virus control (rows 2-8, lane 2), SCoV2 RBD starting at 64.2 ug/mL (row 2, lanes 3-4), SCoV2 RBD starting at 42.8 ug/mL (row 2, lanes 5-6), FCoV2 RBD starting at 2.86 ug/mL (row 2, lanes 7-8), 0.075 mL of PBS in first well (row 2, lanes 9-10), and 0.05 mL PBS in first well (row 2, lanes 11-12). Each well in lanes 3-12 starting from row 3 are serial three-fold dilutions of the RBD or PBS. The RBD stocks were suspended in PBS, and the PBS lanes represent the largest volume of the SCoV2 RBD (0.075 mL) and FCoV2 RBD (0.050 mL) used in the wells in row 2. Plate B (B) used the same plating scheme but had duplicate wells of FCoV2 RBD in ten-fold dilution in row 2 as described on the bottom. The 0.05 mL PBS control represents the largest volume of FCoV2 RBD used. The red horizontal double arrow shows where the blocking effect of the RBD stops when directly observed at the plate in plates A and B. The control Plate C (C) are the highest amounts used for SCoV2 RBD and FCoV2 RBD for Plate A tested without virus to determine the potential cell toxicity caused by the RBDs. After scanning the plates at 100% brightness and 70% contrast, the plates were additionally brightened by 25% for plates A and C and 30% for Plate B with all plates at additional 3% contrast. Next, the plasma from five FCoV1 KU-2-inoculated laboratory cats and six FCoV2 79-1146-inoculated laboratory cats were tested for their immunoblot reactivity to FCoV2-WV (D), FCoV1 RBD (E), FCoV2 RBD (F), and SCoV2 RBD (G). The serum from two SPF cats HOE and HOF served as the negative controls (D-G). Additional positive control serum from SCoV2 inoculated cat UGA4.4 was included for SCoV2 RBD immunoblot (G). All immunoblot photographs were adjusted to 12% brightness and 5% contrast for consistency. (H) Lastly, the PBMC of transiently and chronically FCoV1-infected cats (4GC, G-3) were stimulated with either FCoV1 (red), FCoV2 (blue), or SCoV2 (green) RBD. The expression of IFNγ of each stimulated PBMC is presented as the relative transcription of IFNγ mRNA level relative to the GAPDH mRNA level using qRT-PCR. The stimulation of T-cell mitogen ConA served as a positive control, whereas the RPMI media served as a negative control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157632-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
