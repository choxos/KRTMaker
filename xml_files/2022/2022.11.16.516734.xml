Here, we define the genome-wide incorporation and exchange pattern of canonical and non-canonical histone variants in mouse embryonic stem cells by implementing a recently established, genetically encoded exchange sensor. While exchange of all measured variants scales with transcription, we describe variant-specific associations with transcription elongation and Polycomb binding. We found considerable exchange of H3.1 and H2B variants in heterochromatin and repeat elements, contrasting the stable incorporation and little exchange of H3.3 in these regions. This unexpected association between H3.3 incorporation and exchange of canonical variants is also evident in active promoters and enhancers, and further validated by reduced H3.1 dynamics following depletion of the HIRA H3.3-specific chaperone. The sensor system provides a powerful tool for studying regulation of histone dynamics toward understanding its role in shaping the epigenetic landscape <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Nucleosomes, DNA-wrapped histone octamers that contain two H2A-H2B heterodimers and an H3-H4 tetramer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, are the main structural units of eukaryotic chromatin. In addition to their structural function in DNA compaction, nucleosome composition shapes the epigenomic landscape by affecting DNA accessibility to factors related to transcription, replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Nucleosomes are also subjected to post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone tails, deposited through specialized enzymes, which could define position-specific combinatorial codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Conversely, the replacement of the nucleosome subunits, termed histone exchange, effectively resets position-dependent histone PTMs by replacing them with histones evicted elsewhere and carrying associated modifications, or with histones carrying general modifications added to yet unbound newly-synthesized histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Unlike the deposition of histone modifications, which is gradual and depends on the concerted activity of <italic>trans</italic> factors, histone exchange resets all modifications carried by the associated histones, thus significantly shaping the epigenomic landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Histone variants represent another key factor influencing local and genome-wide nucleosome organization. For example, the histone variant H2A.X is incorporated onto DNA damage sites, and multiple testis-specific histone variants dynamically regulate chromatin accessibility during spermatogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Nucleosome composition in turn affects the binding dynamics of distinct histone subunits in specific regions. For instance, H2A/H2B heterodimers exchange more readily as compared to H3/H4 tetramers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, the replacement of core histones by intrinsically less stable histone variants reduces nucleosome stability and influences exchange rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Most histone variants are expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle, providing the main supply of histones during replication, and are termed “canonical” (also known as core) variants. Others – known as non-canonical variants – are expressed throughout the cell cycle and differ in protein structure and function from their canonical counterparts (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P5">Locus-specific deposition of histones is mediated by associated chaperone complexes. For example, H3.3 is a widely studied non-canonical H3 variant that utilizes two distinct chaperone systems to incorporate into open chromatin and heterochromatin regions (HIRA, and ATRX/DAXX, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In the context of histone exchange, H3.3 is currently the prime mammalian variant to be deeply characterized genome-wide, with high exchange shown to be associated with active promoters and distal regulatory regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Currently, a comprehensive mapping of the exchange landscape associated with other histone variants is largely lacking, mainly due to technical challenges in measuring exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Such maps will not only provide a more detailed view of the mammalian epigenomic landscape, but also allow dissection of potential interactions between histone variants in regulating gene expression.</p><p id="P6">Most current methods used to study histone exchange implement pulse-chase labeling to detect the incorporation of newly synthesized histones as a proxy for histone exchange rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Such systems require multiple time-resolved samples, exhibit inherent measurement delays, and limit perturbation studies necessary for determining causal relationships between histone exchange, <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, and local epigenetic changes. Here, we utilized a histone exchange sensor recently established in yeast that is modified at each genomic position, depending on local exchange rates. An attractive aspect of the sensor system is that it allows separating between incorporation of histones (affecting histone occupancy) from their exchange rates, in which occupancy could remain unchanged, using a single measurement of an unperturbed sample at steady-state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Implementing the sensor system in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) facilitated detailed mapping of the exchange landscape associated with canonical (H3.1 and H2B) and non-canonical (H3.3) histone variants. In addition to high-exchange rates in open chromatin and transcribed regions, we found transcription-independent dynamics of core H3.1 histone variant at bivalent promoters. Replacement of H3.1 and H2B variants at repeat elements of heterochromatin regions is associated with stable incorporation of H3.3. In agreement with these findings, knockout of HIRA, a histone H3.3 specific chaperone at open chromatin, affected exchange levels of canonical histone H3.1 at enhancer and promoter regions. The experimental system described here can be broadly used to study histone exchange during development and in adult tissues.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>A sensor system for charting non-canonical histone H3.3 exchange in mESCs</title><p id="P7">To measure histone exchange dynamics in mESCs, we adapted a sensor system that has been established and validated in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The system constitutes a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) cleavage sequence placed between myc and HA tags (hereafter termed sensor) and fused to a histone variant of choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The TEV protease is fused to a complementary histone subunit. Of note, the formation of nucleosomes is a two-step process in which the assembly of the H3-H4 tetramer on DNA is followed by the binding of two H2A-H2B dimers. Therefore, tagged histone variants come into proximity only upon binding to DNA, where cleavage of the TEV recognition site and release of the myc tag can occur. In this framework, the dual tagging system allows computing endogenous histone occupancy and exchange dynamics. Specifically, the HA tag remains intact regardless of TEV cleavage and as such, reports on total histone occupancy. On the other hand, the myc tag depends on the co-residence time of the tagged subunits at the given locus. Long co-residence results in productive cleavage and is characterized by a low myc signal relative to HA. In contrast, a high myc signal indicates short residence time and hence rapid replacement of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). The ratio between the levels of myc and HA, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), reports on region-specific levels of histone exchange. Apart from exchange, individual myc and HA tags provide information on alternative modes of histone dynamics, that is, histone incorporation and eviction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). When new histones are incorporated into a free DNA, both myc and HA signals are expected to increase, whereas eviction of histones is characterized by reduced HA but invariant myc levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To validate the system in mammalian cells, we first focused on the well-studied non-canonical H3.3 variant, which has been previously examined using pulse-chase methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To this end, we targeted a transgene stably expressing histone H3.3 fused to a sensor alongside H2B fused to the TEV protease into the <italic>Hipp11</italic> (<italic>H11</italic>) safe harbor locus in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We generated cell lines expressing alternative forms of the TEV-cleavage site that either allow or prevent cleavage, termed cleavable and non-cleavable (NC) versions, respectively. The latter also serves as a control for potential technical differences between myc and HA antibodies in ChIP experiments. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting validated the expression and proper cleavage activity of the sensor system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Importantly, transgene expression did not seem to affect the self-renewal and differentiation potential of mESCs, as demonstrated by spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies and robust contribution to mouse chimeras upon injection into host blastocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid exchange of histone H3.3 at transcription start sites and active enhancers</title><p id="P9">Genome-wide ChIP-seq detected comparable read coverage of both myc and HA signals at distinct genomic regions in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). This analysis also confirmed a high correlation between HA and myc signals across the genome in cells expressing the non-cleavable sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We further detected high correlation between non-cleavable HA and myc signals within previously annotated histone H3.3 peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, indicating that the tagged histones are properly incorporated into native nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). Yet, analyzing the same regions in the cleavable sensor cell lines identified a significant proportion of regions with high myc to HA ratios indicating rapid exchange, that partially overlap with transcription start sites (TSSs) of the top 1% of highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This observation prompted us to further explore the association between exchange patterns of histone H3.3 and gene transcription. Consistent with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, exchange levles around transcription start sites (TSSs) for protein-coding genes grouped by expression levels revealed a strong correlation between H3.3 exchange and RNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). Notably, transcription also positively correlated with H3.3 occupancy, as demonstrated by increasing HA signal, confirming the high deposition of H3.3 at promoters of expressed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Finally, and in agreement with the above results, exchange rates at TSSs positively correlate with active marks (H3K4me3), and anti-correlate with repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next focused on distal enhancer elements, where H3.3 was also reported to be highly deposited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In mESCs, enhancers exhibit various regulatory states defined by the combination of associated histone marks and are often classified as active, primed, or poised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Active enhancers are typically co-marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me1, while enhancers primed for activation contain only H3K4me1-marked histones. Lastly, a subset of H3K4me1-marked enhancers termed poised also contain Polycomb-derived H3K27me3 repressive marks and are not associated with active genes. Nevertheless, poised enhancers were shown to be bound by <italic>trans</italic>-activators and exhibit DNase-I hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We observed the highest exchange within active enhancers, which positively correlated with increased expression of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). In contrast, primed enhancers showed overall stable incorporation of histone H3.3 (indicated by lower myc to HA ratios), similar to background control regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, although lacking active H3K27ac marks, poised enhancers exhibit lower but evident exchange levels, potentially reflecting the binding of chromatin remodelers or transcription factors at these sites. Taken together, the sensor system largely validated and further extended previous exchange measurements of histone H3.3 associated with enhancer and promoter elements.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Variant-specific histone exchange patterns in open reading frames</title><p id="P11">We next set out to compare genome-wide exchange dynamics of canonical histone variants. Despite constituting the bulk of histones, genome-wide exchange of canonical variants has not been systematically charted. We therefore generated two additional sensor cell lines for the canonical histones H3.1 or H2B. For the former, the sensor was fused to histone H3.1 and the TEV-protease to H2B, and for the latter, the sensor was fused to histone H2B and the TEV-protease to histone H3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Both systems were stably integrated into the <italic>H11</italic> locus, and proper expression and cleavage activity were validated at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, controls containing non-cleavable myc showed the expected high correlations between myc and HA signals, and comprehensive read coverage in all samples analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b,c</xref>). To identify exchange patterns associated with functional genomic regions for the three histone variants, we used a broad classification of regulatory elements, previously defined based on combinatorial patterns of histone marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). All three variants show high exchange within active promoters and enhancer regions that are also enriched in H3.3 and H2B variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). In heterochromatin regions (marked by H3K9me3), we detect high H3.1 exchange, whereas H3.3 and H2B histones are significantly more stable. Interestingly, pronounced differences between histone variants were observed in regions associated with transcriptional elongation (marked by H3K36me3), where histone H2B exhibits rapid exchange while the other two variants showed little or no dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Focusing on the association between exchange and transcription, we compared the exchange levels in the vicinity of TSSs, clustered by gene expression. First, this analysis revealed that similar to histone H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), exchange of both H3.1 and H2B scales with transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Second, this analysis confirmed variant-specific exchange patterns within gene bodies. While H3.3 histones showed restricted exchange upstream of the TSSs, H3.1 exchange occurs adjacent to TSSs - both upstream and downstream. Additionally, H3.1 shows low exchange within gene bodies. Finally, histone H2B exchanges at similar levels at the TSS and in the gene-body. These results are consistent with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in <italic>S</italic>.<italic>cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, demonstrating that RNA polymerase promotes the replacement of the more labile H2B histones in gene bodies, whereas H3 variants are mostly retained. While the functional significance of this observation remains to be elucidated, it is possible that retention of histone H3 within gene bodies might serve to stabilize an expression-promoting epigenetic landscape such as H3K36me3.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Exchange of histone H3.1, but not H3.3 and H2B, at bivalent gene promoters is transcription-independent</title><p id="P13">Though most strongly associated with gene transcription, histone exchange was also proposed as a mechanism mediating gene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next sought to study histone exchange in association with gene repression. Polycomb protein groups (PcGs) – multicomponent protein collection that forms two complexes termed Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 and mediate gene repression through deposition of trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) (reviewed in refs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>). At first, analysis of all gene promoters confirmed binding of PcGs components to be weakly associated with gene expression and exchange levels in the three variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Amongst analyzed Polycomb proteins, SUZ12, EZH2, and JARID2 were shown to bind promoters of developmentally regulated genes, co-marked by both active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications (termed bivalent promoters), and associated with H3.3 dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Given this observation, we focused the analysis on bivalent genes.</p><p id="P14">To study exchange at bivalent promoters, we first binned previously defined bivalent regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> by increased binding of SUZ12, EZH2, and JARID2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3e,f</xref>), utilizing individual myc and HA signals to distinguish between additional modes of histone dynamics that included histone incorporation and eviction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Bins with low PRC2 enrichment score (&lt; 2) showed elevation in both H3.3 HA and myc levels, demonstrating increasing H3.3 incorporation at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Similarly, increasing HA and myc levels were also detected for H3.1 and H2B variants within bins with low PRC2 enrichment scores (&lt; 2 and 3.5, respectively). However, unlike H3.3, in these variants myc levels elevated more than HA, suggesting that incorporation is coupled with increased replacement at these sites. On the other hand, bins with mean PRC2 enrichment (from 2 to 3.5 for H3.3 and H3.1 variants and &gt; 3.5 for H2B variant) show constant histone occupancy and largely invariant myc-to-HA ratio, demonstrating that after a certain level, increased binding of PRC2 does not lead to higher exchange. Finally, bins with high PRC2 binding showed decreased HA signal for the H3.3 and H3.1 variants. As myc level of H3.3 is also decreasing this suggests reduced incorporation of H3.3 at these sites. Contrary, myc levels of H3.1 remained mostly invariant, suggesting either increased eviction of this variant or of tagged histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), perhaps due to direct competition between histones and PRC2 for DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">We next binned promoters of bivalent genes by their expression levels and compared their associated exchange levels to those of non-bivalent genes with a similar expression. This analysis showed that exchange levels of H3.3 and H2B variants at bivalent genes increased with transcription, but to a lesser extent compared to the non-bivalent genes. Contrary, exchange level of H3.1 remained constant and largely independent of increased transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Together, our data is most consistent with H3.3 and H2B exchange at bivalent genes correlating with increased transcription rather than with PRC2 binding, further extending previous analysis of chromatin properties at bivalent genes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Asymmetric exchange surrounding CTCF binding sites, irrespective of high-order chromatin organization</title><p id="P16">In eukaryotes, gene activity is largely influenced by its spatial positioning and genomic architecture that are controlled by structural regulatory elements of intergenic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.

As expected, we observed a dramatic reduction of H3.3 occupancy at enhancers and promoter regions in HIRA mutant cells.

In this study, we used novel sensors that continuously report on histone occupancy (measured by HA tag), incorporation (myc tag), and exchange (myc/HA ratio), at each genomic locus, providing a comprehensive genome-wide view of nucleosome occupancy and dynamics. Applying the sensors to H3.3, H3.1, and H2B histone variants, identified both transcription-associated and transcription-independent exchange. Though transcription-associated exchange was expected, we found variation in the exchange patterns between the three variants: H3.3 exchanges exclusively in the promoters, H3.1 in the vicinity of TSSs, and H2B equally in promoters and open reading frames. These results are consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, demonstrating that transcription and RNA polymerase promote the replacement of the more labile H2B in gene bodies, whereas H3 variants are mostly retained. Nucleosome remodeling was previously shown to facilitate transcriptional elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>. However, whilst disruption of nucleosomes is necessary for passage of RNA polymerase within gene bodies, it opposes chromatin integrity and retention of histone marks. We therefore speculate that the restricted eviction of H2A-H2B dimers serves to loosen the DNA while retaining modification-enriched H3-H4 subunits in place.</p><p id="P26">Histones are also exchanging within regulatory elements in a transcription-independent manner, albeit at lower levels, as in the case of H3.3 exchange at poised enhancers and H3.1 exchange at bivalent promoters of lowly expressed genes. Exchange at these regions could result from competition between repressors and histones for binding to the same regions, resulting in decreased histone occupancy as exemplified for H3.1 and H3.3 variants within bivalent promoters of high PRC2 binding. Since in mESCs poised enhancers and Polycomb regulated promoters are implicated in cell differentiation potency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup>, exchange within these sites potentially poises local chromatin for binding of lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs). Yet, perturbation studies on factors regulating exchange at these sites and their effect on differentiation are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p id="P27">Despite the high exchange levels of histone H3.3 in active genes and distal regulatory elements, depletion of H3.3 was shown to introduce little effect on the overall gene expression program in mESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

Here, depleting HIRA in mESCs resulted in a significant reduction in histone exchange at open chromatin, suggesting that H3.3 deposition promotes nucleosome dynamics at these sites.

Hence, exchange in these sites is probably occurring prior to, and not as a consequence of, TF binding.</p><p id="P28">Intriguingly, we detected exchange dynamics for H3.1 and H2B variants in repetitive sequences embedded within lamin-associated, H3K9me3 marked heterochromatin regions. Silencing of repeat sequences takes place in a dynamic chromatin environment in which nucleosomes are disrupted and re-assembled by complex protein machinery involving chromatin remodelers, TFs, and histone chaperons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that such chromatin resetting is associated with continuous exchange of canonical H3.1 and H2B histones but stable deposition of H3.3 histone. The interdependancy between canonical and non-canonical variants in this context is less clear, but it is likely that replacement of core histone variants creates DNA-accessible regions that promote binding of H3.3 and its associated silencing complex involving ATRX/DAXX chaperones and methyltransferases. In the case of IAP elements, DAXX appears to play a major role in silencing and involves interaction with H3.3, whose function is to stabilize DAXX protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>.

1</label><caption><title>Novel sensor of histone exchange successfully reports on replacement levels of non-canonical H3.3 variant in mESCs</title><p>a) Schematic representation of the sensor system. TEV protease is fused to H2B while H3.3 contains a sensor consisting of HA and myc epitopes separated by a TEV cleavage site. TEV-catalyzed cleavage of histone tags occurs only in the context of nucleosomes depending on the residence time of histone subunits such that histones with long residence time will have cleaved-off myc but preserved HA tag. myc is therefore present only on newly deposited histones.</p><p>b) Schematic representation of different modes of histone dynamics: exchange, integration and eviction as inferred by myc and HA signals. In case of histone exchange, occupancy (as measured by HA) remains constant but myc level is increasing. On the other hand, increasing myc and HA levels indicate incorporation of new histones on free DNA. Finally, eviction is characterized by decreased HA level.</p><p>c) Western blot analysis on whole cell extract validates kinetics of TEV cleavage for H3.3 tags with cleavable and non-cleavable TEV cleavage site. Cleaved (20kDa) and non-cleaved (35kDa) version of histone H3.3 were shown. Anti-GAPDH was used as a loading control.</p><p>d) Genome-wide comparison of myc and HA ChIP-seq signals in cell expressing NC sensor variant was performed by tiling genome into 5kb windows. Mean read count is calculated for each window and represented as density plot. Shown is Pearson correlation calculated for all windows. Dashed is 1:1 reference line.</p><p>e,f) myc and HA signal comparisons over annotated H3.3 peaks from ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> for cells expressing NC (e) and cleavable sensor variant (f). Black dots represent H3.3 peaks overlapping with TSSs of top 1% expressed genes. Represented is 1:1 reference line.</p><p>g) H3.3 exchange levels surrounding TSSs.
