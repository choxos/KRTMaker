There are however several cellular and physiological responses to auxin that occur within seconds, far too rapid to be mediated by transcriptional changes, for which no molecular mechanism has yet been identified. Using a phosphoproteomic strategy in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> roots, we identify an ultra-rapid auxin response system that targets over 1700 proteins, many within 30 seconds. Auxin response is chemically specific, requires known auxin-binding proteins, and targets various pathways. Through exploring its temporal dynamics, we infer auxin-triggered kinase-substrate networks and identify apoplastic pH changes as a target of signaling and as part of a relay mechanism. By generating a variety of phosphoproteomic datasets, integrated with structural information in a web-app, and by demonstrating analysis and inference strategies, we offer a resource to explore rapid and dynamic signaling in plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Auxin</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>protein phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>kinase networks</kwd><kwd>apoplastic pH</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Since its discovery nearly a century ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, the plant signaling molecule auxin has been the focus of intensive investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The naturally occurring indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) is widespread in nature and found in essentially all plants studied to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Its biological activity as a signaling molecule, acting at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations, is extremely profound. When applied to plants or plant cells, auxin can trigger a wide range of physiological, cellular and molecular changes that likely underly the long-term effects on plant growth and development. Classical examples of auxin activity include mediating tropic growth (e.g. phototropism or gravitropism) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, as well as the promotion of vascular cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and the induction of adventitious or lateral roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Molecular and cellular responses to auxin include rapid changes in membrane chemical potential, associated changes in ion transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, changes in the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, changes in cellular growth rate and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and importantly, reprogramming of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">To identify the mechanisms underlying the responses to auxin that control plant growth, genetic screens have led to the isolation of a range of Arabidopsis mutants that are insensitive to auxin’s growth-inhibiting action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Cloning of the affected genes, followed by detailed molecular, biochemical and structural analysis have revealed a simple, yet powerful mechanism for auxin response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In what is referred to as the Nuclear Auxin Pathway (NAP), auxin enables interaction of Aux/IAA transcriptional inhibitors with a ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup>) to promote their degradation. This liberates DNA-binding ARF transcription factors from Aux/IAA inhibition and allows transcriptional control of their many target genes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). This NAP can account for many of the observed auxin activities across land plants and in many developmental contexts, including responses to environmental signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, the time required to bring about changes in cellular physiology through transcriptional control is substantial, and limited by the velocity of transcription, translation, protein folding and targeting. Hence, even if the first IAA-induced transcripts are visible between 5-10 minutes after IAA treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, it is extremely unlikely that the NAP can account for the changes in e.g. ion fluxes, cellular growth and subcellular traffic that have been observed to occur within seconds to minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It is therefore inevitable that there exists a second auxin response system that is kinetically suited to mediate such rapid responses. Indeed, several “non-canonical” auxin responses have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> that do not rely on a (complete) NAP, but that may involve one of its components. For example, fast inhibition of Arabidopsis root growth and changes in membrane polarity involve the AFB1 receptor of the NAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Other rapid responses including the activation of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases at the plasma membrane for growth regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and cytoplasmic streaming, possibly related functions in endocytic trafficking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> require a cell surface auxin signaling mediated by the ABP1 auxin receptor and its associated TMK receptor-like kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, the existence of fast responses to auxin is evident, but it is unclear what mechanisms and response system(s) might underlie such fast responses.</p><p id="P6">Here, we explore the role that reversible protein phosphorylation may play in fast responses to auxin. Protein phosphorylation is a widespread mechanism for enzymatically modifying the structure and function of pre-existing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, thus eliminating the need for <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. Given that phosphorylation depends only on the (allosteric) activation of a protein kinase, the reaction is intrinsically rapid. Several well-known examples of phosphorylation-based signaling exist across the kingdoms of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Among these, some are particularly rapid, with Insulin and EGF ligands triggering initial phosphorylation changes by receptor kinases within seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, followed by relays and amplification steps with additional protein kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation-based signaling is also widespread in plants, and mediates responses to peptide ligands in development and immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, as well as to Brassinosteroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Whether phosphorylation-based signaling is a meaningful component in auxin response is an open question. There is ample evidence for phosphorylation-based events in the control of activity and localization of PIN auxin transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Whether however, these events are part of a rapid signaling system is an open question. The TMK1 receptor-like kinase mediates IAA-triggered phosphorylation changes, even within two minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, but the scope or dynamics of this response is unclear, given that the number of targets reported is limited.</p><p id="P7">Here, we used a phosphoproteomics strategy to address if a fast response system to IAA built on protein phosphorylation, exists. Prior phosphoproteomic analysis of auxin response has been reported in both Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In rice, a 3-hour treatment was reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, while in Arabidopsis, treatments used the synthetic auxin analogue 1-NAA for either 2 hours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> or 11 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, leaving the question of whether naturally occurring auxin can trigger phosphorylation changes at the same scale. We recently reported that IAA can trigger changes in protein phosphorylation in Arabidopsis roots within 2 minutes and that this response requires ABP1 and TMK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, it is entirely unclear what the specificity, kinetics, scope and targets of this response are.</p><p id="P8">Here, we show that auxin triggers changes in the phosphorylation of hundreds of proteins in Arabidopsis roots well within 30 seconds. An extended time series showed that over two thousand proteins are differentially phosphorylated within 10 minutes, with a range of temporal dynamics. Analysis of mutants suggests these responses to involve both intracellular and extracellular auxin perception. We leveraged the rich datasets to identify pathways and functions that are triggered by rapid auxin signaling, predict signaling hub kinases and demonstrate a very rapid effect on apoplastic pH. Lastly, we compiled the datasets in a searchable web tool, integrated with protein structural information. We thus identified a novel layer in auxin response with profound impact on many cellular pathways and functions, and created a resource that will form the starting point for renewed mechanistic investigation in the underexplored area of fast auxin response.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of a specific, rapid, phosphorylation-based auxin response</title><p id="P9">To explore the ability of Arabidopsis roots to respond to auxin by changing protein phosphorylation levels, we initially treated roots with a concentration (100 nM) of the naturally occurring auxin Indole 3-Acetic Acid (IAA) that is sub-maximal with regards to physiological responses. The earliest recorded transcriptional responses to auxin treatment occur after 5-10 minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Also given theoretical considerations related to gene expression and protein synthesis, we chose a 2 minute treatment time for mapping phosphorylation changes, assuming that any changes seen at that time are not influenced by changes in transcription. Using statistical analysis across 4 biological replicates, we next identified differential phosphosites (note that these are mapped to protein groups – not necessarily individual proteins, if there are multiple close homologs). We optimized the treatment and sample preparation procedure and measured samples on multiple mass spectrometers, and found the results to be very robust. Two minutes IAA treatment on Arabidopsis roots changed the abundance of 1048 phosphosites (FDR ≤ 0.01), where 666 were more and 382 were less abundant after IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We performed shotgun proteomic MS measurement on equivalent samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which suggest that observed changes in phosphosite abundance are not generally caused by altered protein levels. Likewise, the differentially phosphorylated proteins showed little overlap with transcriptionally regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). We therefore regard these changes as hyper-/hypo-phosphorylation events.</p><p id="P10">The vast effect of a 2-minute IAA treatment on the phosphoproteome to this low IAA concentration is striking, and suggest this to be a hormonal response. However, auxin is a weak organic acid derived from Tryptophan, and it is possible that (part of) the response observed is an unspecific response to weak organic acids or auxin-like molecules. To test chemical specificity, we therefore used a panel of related chemicals (all at 100 nM) in the same set-up, and measured phosphoproteomes after 2 minutes treatment. None of the synthetic auxin analogs 2,4-Dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4D), 1-Naphtaleneacetic Acid (1-NAA) or 2-Naphtaleneacetic Acid (2-NAA) trigger phosphorylation changes that showed any correlation to those induced by IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; Spearman’s rank correlation [R]: 0.12 for 2,4-D; 0.07 for 1-NAA and 0.01 for 2-NAA). Likewise, neither Benzoic Acid (BA; R=0.25) nor Formic Acid (FA; R=0.20) induced IAA-like phosphorylation changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). As a control, two entirely independent IAA treatments and measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) showed strong correlation (R=0.77). Thus, IAA response is chemically specific. Synthetic auxins have auxinic activity in several physiological assays, and it is therefore striking that 2,4-D, 1-NAA and 2-NAA failed to trigger IAA-like phosphorylation changes. To test if these can act like IAA in this response, albeit less efficiently, we measured phosphoproteomes at a 10-fold higher concentration (1 μM). Indeed, at this concentration, 1-NAA (R=0.90) and 2-NAA (R=0.88) could induce IAA-like phosphorylation changes, but BA could not (R=0.12; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, IAA induces a rapid, chemically specific, hormonal phosphorylation response in Arabidopsis roots.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Auxin phospho-response is ultra-rapid and dynamic</title><p id="P11">To explore the temporal dynamics of the newly identified phosphorylation response, we generated a time series of IAA treatments on Arabidopsis roots, ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. To ensure that this time series was not confounded by auxin-independent effects of submerging roots in growth medium, we also sampled solvent mock controls for each time point, and subtracted the phosphosite abundance in the mock treatment from each IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This led to a set of unique phosphoproteomes that could be clearly resolved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, even at 30 seconds, lAA triggered changes in abundance of hundreds of phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), underlining the rapid nature of the response. Compiling all differentially phosphorylated sites across the entire time series, a total of 2962 phosphosites is regulated by lAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), corresponding to 1770 proteins, representing ~5% of the proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis genome.</p><p id="P12">We next used the Minardo-Model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> to order groups of phosphopeptides that show similar trends of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In each cluster, generalized linear models are derived from individual profiles which, together with Z-scores and post hoc Tukey test, infers event windows at which the majority of profiles show half-maximal amplitude response. From this analysis, the earliest events likely occur well within 30 seconds after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; Clusters 1-9). This analysis clearly identified a range of temporal patterns in IAA-dependent phosphorylation. These ranged from transient, early or late hyper- or hypophosphorylation to gradual hyper- or hypo-phosphorylation, and oscillatory hyper- and hypophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Phosphorylation events are often counteracted by regulatory dephosphorylation in enzymatic feedback loops. Given the highly dynamic phosphorylation patterns upon IAA treatment, it is possible that such feedbacks are operating here. To test the reversibility of the widespread IAA-induced differential phosphorylation, we performed a 2-minute IAA treatment, followed by 5-minute washout treatment with IAA-less medium. If the response were reversible, the profile after washout should resemble that after 2 minutes, or even before IAA treatment. Instead, PCA analysis of the washout treatment, along with the time series, grouped the washout treatment with the 10-minute treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that the IAA response is not globally reversible and persists for minutes even after removal of the signal.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genetic requirements of rapid auxin response</title><p id="P14">The widespread phosphorylation response to IAA treatment is novel, and a key question therefore is what mechanism mediates it. We initially explored the likely location of the receptor or binding site for IAA. As a weak acid, IAA tends to be protonated in the apoplast, and can enter the cell to some degree. Import into the cytosol is however facilitated by the AUX1 permease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. To ask if the binding site for IAA is intracellular or apoplastic, we measured a time series phosphoproteome in the <italic>aux1-100</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In case auxin is perceived intracellularly, one would expect a delay in the response. The <italic>aux1</italic> mutant did show a substantially different phosphorylation pattern, and PCA analysis showed clear separation of wild-type and mutant, irrespective of IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly however, the <italic>aux1</italic> mutant showed a profound response to IAA, even at 30 seconds, which suggests that facilitated IAA influx is not strictly required for fast response. Hence, at least some of the IAA binding capacity for this fast response likely resides in the apoplast.</p><p id="P15">Two auxin binding sites have been studied in detail: the nuclear TIR1/AFB receptors mediate auxin-dependent gene regulation, as well as some rapid non-transcriptional responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For the latter, the cytosolic AFB1 protein appears to play a prominent role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The ABP1 protein resides both in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the apoplast, and has been connected to non-transcriptional responses, likely through interactions with the TMK1 receptor-like kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We compared previously recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> phosphoproteomes in <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> mutants with one generated of the <italic>afb1</italic> mutants after a 2-minute IAA treatment.</p><p id="P16">Strikingly, each of the three mutants showed profound changes in their auxin-induced phosphoproteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). In all three mutants, a significant fraction of the auxin-triggered changes in phosphorylation were lost, or in cases, oppositely regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To address that effect of each mutation on the level of phosphorylation of IAA-regulated sites in the absence of external IAA treatment, we compared mock-treated mutants with wild-type and evaluated the phosphorylation level of the entire set of IAA-triggered differential sites. This analysis showed that IAA-induced phosphosites are strongly hypophosphorylated in untreated <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>afb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> accumulate phosphorylation defects during their normal growth, while this is not the case for <italic>afb1</italic>. Quantitatively, the number of IAA-triggered differential phosphosites was strongly reduced in all three mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). When clustering mutants according to the similarity of the changes in phosphorylation levels across the entire set of IAA-dependent phospopeptides (in wild-type), we found that <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> clustered together, and <italic>afb1</italic> showed a distinct effect on the global IAA-triggered phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Strikingly, a large set of phosphosites was similarly affected in <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> mutants, and oppositely affected in the <italic>afb1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This behavior is clearly illustrated by examples of individual phosphosites a range of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). This demonstrates that ABP1, TMK1 and AFB1 are all required for normal auxin-triggered phosphorylation, and that ABP1 and TMK1 act coordinately, while AFB1 generally opposes ABP1/TMK1 action.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Auxin-dependent phosphorylation targets multiple cellular pathways</title><p id="P17">To explore the range of cellular functions potentially targeted by IAA through phosphorylation, we initially mined the full set of differential phosphosites for overrepresented functions, families and pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differential phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) showed that a broad range of cellular functions is subject to regulation. These include a plethora of processes at the plasma membrane or endomembranes, such as endocytosis, vesicle fusion and ion transport, but also prominently featured nuclear processes such as transcription, chromatin structure and splicing. While there is very strong enrichment of plasma membrane, cytosolic and nuclear proteins, most cellular locations are targeted by auxin-triggered phosphorylation. Based on this GO analysis, the prediction is that many aspects of cell function are targeted by IAA-triggered phosphoregulation.</p><p id="P18">We next surveyed the dynamic phosphorylation of proteins within functional groups that had been linked to auxin action, phosphorylation or were clearly enriched in the GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). PIN phosphorylation is a well-known regulatory step in transporter activation or polar localization. We identified a range of phosphosites on PiN1, 2, 3 and 7. While most were rapidly hyperphosphorylated, those on PIN1 were hypophosphorylated. interestingly, these all represent sites that have not previously been connected to PIN regulation. We likewise found rapid hyperphosphorylation on the ABCB19 auxin transport protein.</p><p id="P19">Auxin profoundly regulates gene expression, a function that has thus far been connected to the NAP system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We noticed that there is a very rapid hypophosphorylation on a range of proteins involved in chromatin structure and activity. This includes BRM and SYD SWI/SNF ATPases and nearly all members of the TPL/TPR family. The function of these events is not known, but there it is likely that early phosphorylation events prime or condition later transcriptional responses.</p><p id="P20">A third functional group that is strongly affected by auxin is cell wall and cytoskeletal proteins. We found many differential phosphosites on Cellulose Synthases, Microtubule Associated Proteins, Myosins, and Dynamin Related Proteins. There was no clear pattern in hyper/hypo-phosphorylation among these, and in some cases, the same protein was oppositely affected at different residues.</p><p id="P21">Lastly, IAA appears to trigger a range of phosphorylation events in mediators of signaling for other plant hormones. For example, multiple proteins in the ethylene pathway (ACS8, CTR1, EIN2) are targeted, as are multiple brassinosteroid (BES1, BZR1, BSL2, BSK2) and ABA (ABF4, PYL1), and the jasmonic acid component MYC2. Thus, while most of these sites are not yet connected to activity of these factors, it is evident that rapid lAA signaling has the potential to influence the response to other plant hormones.</p><p id="P22">The phosphorylation changes reported here offer a rich source of data that allows developing hypotheses for future studies. To facilitate the use of this rich dataset and to help interact with the data, we designed a webtool (AuxPhos; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weijerslab.shinyapps.io/AuxPhos">https://weijerslab.shinyapps.io/AuxPhos</ext-link>) and user interface. AuxPhos allows to search individual proteins by their unique identifier, and visualize the quantification of its phosphopeptides across the various datasets (wild-type with IAA and various related chemicals; time series; <italic>aux1, abp1, tmk1</italic> and <italic>afb1</italic> mutants). in addition to offering a searchable interface for navigating phosphoproteins, we have implemented AlphaFold2-based protein structural models to visualize on predicted protein structures, where differential phosphorylation occurs. An examples of such visualizations on the EIR1/PIN2 protein are shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). As further phosphoproteomic data will become available, these will be integrated in the tool.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identification of kinases in auxin-triggered phosphoresponse</title><p id="P23">Given the availability of a densely sampled time series and the identification of nearly 3000 phosposites, we asked if the dataset could be used to infer phosphorylation relationships. To this end, we filtered the entire phosphoproteome dataset for phosphosites in the (predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>) activation loop of the full set of Arabidopsis kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This identified 26 kinases that were differentially phosphorylated in their activation loop during the IAA-triggered time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), most of which were hyperphosphorylated, likely signifying activation of kinase activity. We next performed a regression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) where we identified phosphorylation sites that temporally matched or followed the dynamics of activation of each kinase, obeying several statistical criteria. This led to the generation of a kinase-target network encompassing all 23 regulated kinases and 2140 phosphotargets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>). To test the validity of this inference approach, we asked if protein kinases with known phosphotargets were correctly predicted. This analysis is challenging because of the relatively small number of well-documented kinase-substrate relationships with information about the exact phosphosite. Nonetheless, we found several such pairs to conform to their predicted relationship in our dataset: A RAF kinase was connected to its OST1 target, and this OST1 kinase to a bZIP target. In addition, D6PK was connected to PIN7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with PIN phosphorylation by this kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">We next ranked the 23 kinases according to their weight and position in the phosphonetwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicated by their degree and their betweenness centrality. These two parameters were correlated in this network. This identified several kinases as potential hubs in this network. These include the D6PK kinase, as well as the LRR-RLK protein LRR1, a group of closely related RAF kinases and PIP5K2. The latter is a phosphoinositide kinase, and it is an open question if the PIP5K activity or the membrane changes it induces are correlated with downstream phosphorylation. In any event, this network analysis offers a prioritized set of auxin-regulated kinases that are strong candidates for mediating rapid responses.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Rapid auxin response controls membrane polarization</title><p id="P25">The many functions enriched in the IAA-dependent phosphoproteome include the control of intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which we explored further given that membrane polarity and apoplastic pH have been shown to be subject to auxin control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. To explore this regulation in more detail, we analyzed phosphorylation dynamics of the family of Arabidopsis H+-ATPase (AHA) proton pumps. These directly transport protons across membranes and tend to be localized to the plasma membrane, thus directly controlling apoplastic pH and membrane polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. One AHA is directly phosphorylated by TMK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and we indeed found both TMK1 and AHA1/2 phosphorylation to be rapidly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Likewise, most AHA proteins are differentially phosphorylated within 30 seconds, followed by protein-specific temporal dynamics. This suggests a family-wide regulation of AHA pumps, and predicts that IAA treatment triggers profound and very rapid apoplastic pH changes. Previous pH imaging showed that IAA acts on apoplastic pH within minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, but did not allow to dissect early kinetics. We therefore used the pH-sensitive HPTS dye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> to measure root surface pH changes in a line expressing the cytosolic calcium sensor R-GECO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We imaged roots in a microfluidic device mounted on a vertical microscope to record the apoplastic pH response in the seconds immediately following auxin application. We found that IAA treatment led to an almost instantaneous apoplastic alkalinization, represented by an increase in HPTS fluorescence excited by 488 nm laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). After reaching a peak at 90 seconds, the surface pH decreased to a new plateau which was more alkaline than the pre-treatment levels. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that auxin causes a proton influx into cells, which is counteracted by the activation of proton extrusion from the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and this two-phase process is reflected in the dynamics of AHA phosphorylation. Their complex phosphorylation pattern likely results from a direct activation by the TMKs as well as indirect activation by auxin-induced ion fluxes.</p><p id="P26">The finding that IAA treatment triggers very rapid pH changes, raises the possibility that the pH changes are themselves causal to some of the later phosphorylation events observed after IAA treatment. To address this question, we treated seedlings with the fungal toxin Fusicoccin (FC), a compound that causes continuous activation of H+-ATPases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and recorded phosphoproteomes on dissected roots. A 5-minute FC treatment indeed induced differential phosphorylation on 1097 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). When comparing these phosphosites to those triggered by IAA, we found that more than of half the FC-induced changes are also triggered by IAA, and about 20% of the IAA-induced changes are also triggered by FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that IAA triggers a unique and specific early set of phosphorylation changes, that includes regulatory changes to the H+-ATPases. The changes in pH that ensue from this ATPase regulation then themselves in part trigger a second wave of phosphorylation changes. The FC &amp; IAA-triggered phosphosites include the AHA proteins themselves, suggesting feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), but also include PIN and ABCB auxin transporters and ACA Calcium ATPases. Accordingly, IAA treatment also led to near instantaneous calcium influx, which reached a peak after 60 seconds and then reverted to a new plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>), which, similarly to the surface pH, was higher than the pre-treatment level. This is consistent with the tight connection between the regulation of pH and calcium signaling in plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In conclusion, IAA triggers a highly dynamic, and likely feedback-regulated set of changes in membrane ion fluxes and the dynamics of these events is well reflected in the phosphoproteome dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Through phosphoproteomic profiling, we have identified a previously unknown and unsuspected branch of auxin activity. Strikingly, Arabidopsis root cells are capable of changing the phosphorylation state of more than 1700 proteins within 10 minutes of treatment with the natural auxin IAA, many of which respond within 30 seconds. We have not explored yet earlier timepoints, as these become technically impractical to harvest and perhaps effectivity will also be limited by the speed of IAA diffusion into roots. Computational inference suggests that the earliest responses occur around 20 seconds, a timeframe that is consistent with the kinetics of insulin-triggered phosphorylation in animal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This auxin-triggered phosphorylation response is remarkably chemically specific, with natural IAA being substantially more effective than synthetic analogs, and related – but physiologically inactive – compounds being unable to trigger the response. This suggests a specific auxin binding site for this response. We explored the role of the cytoplasmic and nuclear AFB1 receptor, as well as the extracellular ABP1 protein, along with its interaction partner TMK1. These analyses show that matters are not simple: all three proteins are required for IAA-dependent phosphorylation, but in different ways. Globally, the <italic>afb1</italic> mutation has essentially opposite effects to either <italic>abp1</italic> or <italic>tmk1</italic> mutants, which are highly similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Genetically speaking, these could therefore be interpreted as antagonistic components converging on a shared downstream process. At what level these intersect is a question for future investigation, but it is striking that also with regards to controlling apoplastic pH, the nuclear auxin response and TMK1-dependent response have opposite activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">One caveat of the analysis is that it relies on adding exogenous IAA for observing changes in phosphorylation. One could argue that these treatments do not reflect regulatory events that occur in the absence of external auxin. However, even untreated <italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic> mutants show hypophosphorylation of many of the sites that are hyperphosphorylated upon IAA treatment in wild-type. This suggests that this same set of sites is controlled by these proteins under normal growth conditions, likely by endogenous IAA, and that defects in their phosphorylation accumulate over time in mutants. The further identification of components in auxin-triggered phosphorylation will likely help to connect these regulatory events to cellular physiology.</p><p id="P29">The scope of this auxin response is vast, and targets a multitude of proteins, pathways, organelles and functions. Several known or suspected auxin-related proteins are among these, for example PIN and ABCB auxin transporters. Identifying these sites now allows the formulation of specific hypothesis regarding their regulatory role. As a proof of concept in using this resource, we have explored the proton and Calcium fluxes across the plasma membrane that are predicted by the phosphoproteome data. In addition to validating such predictions, we also demonstrate a causal role of apoplastic pH changes in triggering further phosphorylation changes.</p><p id="P30">A key question is what the impact of this response is on cellular physiology, structure, growth and development. From the many pathways affected, one could expect disruption of the response to have strong phenotypic consequences. It is therefore surprising that the three mutants that strongly affect this response (<italic>abp1, tmk1</italic> and <italic>afb1</italic>) all have largely normal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Each of these mutants has phenotypic defects in germination (<italic>afb1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, regeneration (<italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> or cytoplasmic streaming (<italic>abp1</italic> and <italic>tmk1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, these are subtle. One interpretation is that the phosphorylation network is highly non-linear, with multiple sites being targeted on proteins, phosphatases counteracting kinases, and complex functional redundancies. Given the speed of phosphorylation, it is well possible that the ease of perturbation is balanced by biochemical robustness. It will be interesting to discover the key hubs in the phosphorylation network to understand both the physiological function and the mechanisms underlying robustness. It should be added that this set of mutants has been studied mostly, if not exclusively, under lab-grown, controlled conditions. It is possible that this response system mediates a function that is required in the ecologically relevant setting, and less so in well-controlled conditions.</p><p id="P31">In relating the phosphorylation response to biology, an important consideration is where this response occurs. We have sampled only roots, for purposes of reproducibility and limiting tissue complexity. It does raise the question of whether similar changes occur – and pathways are affected – in other plant parts. Limitations to sensitivity of mass spectrometry currently make it essentially impossible to capture phosphoproteomes of root cell types, even if just because such analysis require tissue dissociation which would preclude studying rapid responses. When examining the proteins targeted, many are expressed beyond roots, and it would appear reasonable to assume that a response as profound as this is not limited to a single cell type or organ.</p><p id="P32">When exploring the proteins and functions targeted by IAA-triggered phosphorylation, several stand out. Firstly, mediators of other hormone pathways are prominently regulated. One interesting example is the EIN2 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This protein is known to be phosphorylated by the CTR1 kinase on two Serines (645 and 924) to control nuclear localization in response to ethylene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Both these sites are hypophosphorylated rapidly following IAA treatment, which predicts that IAA rapidly alters EIN2 localization and ethylene response. Another interesting case is the coordinated hypophosphorylation of a slew of chromatin regulators. This includes BRM and SYD SWI/SNF ATPases and TPL/TPR co-repressors that are all involved in mediating IAA-regulated transcriptional responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. The functional impact of these phosphorylations – if any – is unknown. However, it is very likely that the rapid response system interacts with subsequent transcriptional responses, perhaps by priming cells for gene regulation upon prolonged exposure. In any case, our findings reveal the tremendous molecular changes occurring in cells treated with auxin in the minutes prior to the time window during which transcriptional activity is normally recorded.</p><p id="P33">Lastly, we would like to emphasize the strength of combining ultra-rapid, dense and successive sampling in this approach. We are not aware of other studies using a similar approach to infer the dynamics of any form of rapid signaling in plants. Here, we have leveraged the data to predict kinase-substrate relationships based on regression of temporal profiles. These are successful in capturing known relationships, and help to predict a set of strong candidate kinases that may mediate aspects of auxin-triggered rapid signaling, and will be subject of future investigation. In the accompanying paper (Kuhn, Roosjen et al., accompanying manuscript), we report the identification of a key mediator of rapid phosphosignaling in part through this inference strategy. We expect that similar strategies as reported here will be instrumental in resolving causalities and identifying regulators in responses to other signals, whether hormones, endogenous peptides or environmental or microbial signals.</p><p id="P34">With reporting this novel, unsuspected and vast response, we offer a new avenue in studying a profoundly important plant signaling molecule. Not only is auxin a major regulator of “normal” plant growth and development, it is also a potent herbicide and growth regulator in agricultural and horticultural practice.

Images were acquired using VisiView software (Visitron Systems, v.4.4.0.14). We used a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×10/0.45 objective. HPTS was excited by a 488 nm laser and R-GECO1 by a 561 nm laser. The signal was detected using a PRIME-95B Back-Illuminated sCMOS camera (1,200 × 1,200 pixels; Photometrics).

HPTS signal intensity was measured using rectangular selection in an area on the outer surface of the root, individually along both sides of the root elongation zone. The intensity of the background was measured using rectangular selection in areas not affected by root response and subtracted from the root sides values. For analysis, the average of the values from both root sides was used. The signal intensity of R-GECO1 was measured in a rectangular selection inside the root at the root elongation zone. Due to the high heterogeneity of the samples, the datasets were normalized using division by initial fluorescence intensity values (F/F0). As initial value F0, we used the average fluorescence intensity at five time points before treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Figure S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Figure_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Figure S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Figure_S2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Figure S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Figure_S3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Figure S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Figure_S4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Source Data File</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Source_Data_File.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d32aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figures Caption</label><media xlink:href="EMS157712-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_Caption.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Mark Estelle for making the <italic>afb1</italic> mutant available, our team members for discussions and suggestions.
