Despite numerous detailed OMICS studies, information about small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins (SEPs) is largely missing, because sORFs are poorly annotated, and SEPs are hard to detect experimentally. However, given that SEPs can fulfill important functions, cataloging the full complement of translated sORFs is critical for analyzing their roles in bacterial physiology. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) can detect translated sORFs with high sensitivity, but is not yet routinely applied to bacteria because it must be adapted for each species. Here, we established a Ribo-seq procedure for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 based on RNase I digestion and detected translation for 60% of the annotated coding sequences during growth in minimal medium. Using ORF prediction tools based on Ribo-seq data, subsequent filtering, and manual curation, the translation of 37 non-annotated sORFs with ≤ 70 amino acids was predicted with high confidence. The Ribo-seq data were supplemented by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from three sample preparation approaches and two integrated proteogenomic search databases (iPtgxDBs). Searches against a standard and a 20-fold smaller Ribo-seq data-informed custom iPtgxDB confirmed many annotated SEPs and identified 11 additional novel SEPs. Epitope tagging and Western blot analysis confirmed the translation of 15 out of 20 SEPs selected from the translatome map. Overall, by applying MS and Ribo-seq as complementary approaches, the small proteome of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> was substantially expanded by 48 novel SEPs. Several of them are conserved from <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic> to Bacteria, suggesting important physiological functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>proteogenomics</kwd><kwd>small proteins</kwd><kwd>small open reading frame</kwd><kwd><italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic></kwd><kwd>rhizobia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Over the last two decades, using next-generation sequencing and high throughput OMICS profiling technologies, the genomes of thousands of bacteria have been assembled, and the transcriptomes and proteomes of many of them have been analyzed under different conditions, with the aim of gaining insights into the genetic and molecular basis of their biology. Despite this wealth of data, information about small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins (SEPs), which are proteins with less than 50 or 100 amino acids (aa), is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Duval and Cossart 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Gray et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hemm et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Orr et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>). Recently, the small proteomes of eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses have been focused on, as a growing number of small proteins have been demonstrated to fulfill important physiological functions, such as in cell division, metabolism, transport, signal transduction, spore formation, cell communication, cellular stress responses, and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aoyama et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Duval and Cossart 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hemm et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Melior et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Khitun and Slavoff 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Patraquim et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Song et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, cataloging the full complement of small proteins is critical in achieving a more comprehensive and accurate description of the proteomes of bacterial model organisms and their potential functions.</p><p id="P4">Small protein identification is difficult due to several technical challenges. For instance, SEPs are difficult to detect using SDS-PAGE or mass spectrometry (MS) for various technical reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahrens et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fijalkowski et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>). Limitations of standard shotgun proteomics workflows at the sample preparation, protease digestion, liquid chromatography, MS data acquisition, and bioinformatic data analysis steps affect comprehensive MS-based SEP identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahrens et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cassidy et al. 2021</xref>). Furthermore, variable length thresholds were used in the genome annotation step to minimize the number of spurious ORF predictions. As a result, sORFs encoding truly expressed small proteins are often missing from genome annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hahn et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, various strategies to achieve extensive proteome coverage of the notoriously under-represented classes of small and membrane proteins (novel small proteins are often membrane associated) have been applied for prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Omasits et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Wiśniewski 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>). Methods to enrich bacterial SEPs in samples are further improved, for example, with the use of small pore-sized solid-phase materials ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bartel et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cassidy et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Petruschke et al. 2020</xref>), and digestion with alternative/multiple proteases has been performed to increase the number of identified SEPs ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bartel et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kaulich et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Petruschke et al. 2021</xref>). The obtained mass spectra are usually assigned to peptide or protein sequences by matching the determined fragment ion masses to the predictions derived from a sequence database (DB). Therefore, only peptides with sequences available in the protein search DB can be identified. Consequently, custom protein search DBs that try to capture the entire coding potential of prokaryotic genomes have been proposed, such as integrated proteogenomic search DBs (iPtgxDBs). They integrate and consolidate the differences among existing reference genome annotations, <italic>ab initio</italic> gene predictions, and a modified six-frame translation by considering alternative start sites, thereby enabling the detection of novel proteins, including SEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Omasits et al. 2017</xref>). Thus, proteogenomic studies that combine results from SEP-optimized MS data searched with iPtgxDBs or other custom search DBs and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) have great potential to detect highly comprehensive and accurate compendia of novel small proteins.</p><p id="P5">Ribo-seq has developed into a powerful method to study and annotate translatome globally, including sORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ingolia 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Vazquez-Laslop et al. 2022</xref>). Compared with MS-based proteomics, Ribo-seq has the advantage of higher sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahrens et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Duval and Cossart 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Gray et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hemm et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Orr et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Venturini et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>). Ribo-seq relies on deep sequencing of approximately 30-nt-long “footprint” regions of the mRNA bound by the ribosome during translation and protected against nuclease digestion. In addition to providing a global picture of actively translated mRNAs in the cell, Ribo-seq also reveals the specific location on the RNA where the ribosome was bound, allowing the mapping of ORFs. For this, cells are lysed under certain conditions, allowing for the “freezing” of ribosomes on mRNAs. mRNA parts that are not protected by the ribosomes are then digested to generate ribosome footprints that are sequenced and mapped to the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ingolia et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ingolia 2016</xref>). While Ribo-seq-based detection of translated mRNA works well for eukaryotic cells at a single codon resolution, this method is difficult to utilize for prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Glaub et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Mohammad et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Vazquez-Laslop et al. 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, adapting and refining the Ribo-seq method has enabled the detection of many new, translated sORFs and corresponding SEPs not only in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> but also in several other bacterial species and in halophilic archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gelsinger et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Meydan et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Mohammad et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Vazquez-Laslop et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Weaver et al. 2019</xref>). However, for many bacterial model organisms, Ribo-seq data are still missing, as the protocols typically have to be adapted and optimized for each bacterial organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Duval and Cossart 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Gray et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hemm et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Orr et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Venturini et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Storz et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P6"><italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> is an agriculturally important bacterial species that lives in soil and can fix molecular nitrogen in symbiosis with legume plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Jones et al. 2007</xref>).

In addition, its relatively close relationship to pathogens of the genus <italic>Brucella</italic> makes <italic>S. meliloti</italic> an attractive model for host–pathogen research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Marlow et al. 2009</xref>). Several OMICS datasets are available for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 and its sibling, <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 1021, which is the first sequenced strain of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Galibert et al. 2001</xref>).

The <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 6.7 Mb genome harbors a 3.66 Mb chromosome and two megaplasmids, the 1.35 Mb pSymA and the 1.68 Mb pSymB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sallet et al. 2013</xref>). As a proof of principle, an iPtgxDB created for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 has allowed the detection of the 14-aa-long leader peptide peTrpL in the proteomic data, in which a function in resistance to multiple antimicrobial compounds can be subsequently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Melior et al. 2020</xref>). However, the identification of additional functional SEPs in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and related Alphaproteobacteria has been limited by the lack of studies specifically targeting the small proteome and translatome.</p><p id="P7">Here, we developed and then applied Ribo-seq on <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 to map its translatome globally, with a focus on the small proteome (data available at our interactive web-based genome-browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/ribobase">http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/ribobase</ext-link>). The use of RNase I in our Ribo-seq showed successful trimming of mRNA regions that were not protected by ribosomes, allowing differentiation between translated and untranslated regions. Besides detecting the translation of annotated sORFs (some of which are available in recent updates of the genome annotation), we also uncovered 37 translated novel, non-annotated sORFs located on different replicons. The translation of several annotated, as well as novel, sORFs was further validated by MS-based proteomics using iPtgxDBs and/or epitope tagging and Western blot analysis, thereby confirming predictions based on Ribo-seq coverage. Eleven novel SEPs were uniquely identified by MS, showing that using both methods when mapping the small proteome is advantageous. Overall, our combined approach provided a set of 48 novel <italic>S. meliloti</italic> sORFs, many of which are conserved, as a resource to further elucidate their roles in bacterial physiology and symbiosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Growth and harvest of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> for Ribo-seq</title><p id="P8"><italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Casse et al. 1979</xref>) was first cultivated on TY (5 g of BactoTryptone, 3 g of Bacto-yeast extract, and 0.3 g of CaC<sub>2</sub> per liter) agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Beringer 1974</xref>). The plate cultures were used to inoculate liquid cultures, which were grown semi-aerobically (routinely, 30 ml of medium in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask under constant agitation at 140 rpm) at 30 °C in GMS minimal medium (10 g of D-mannitol, 5 g of sodium glutamate, 5 g of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 g of MgSO<sub>4</sub> × 7H<sub>2</sub>O, and 0.04 g of CaCl<sub>2</sub> per liter; trace elements: 0.05 mg of FeCl<sub>3</sub> × 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.01 mg of H<sub>3</sub>Bo<sub>3</sub>, 0.01 mg of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> × 7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.01 mg of CoCl<sub>2</sub> × 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.01 mg of CuSO<sub>4</sub> × 5H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.35 mg of MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.01 mg of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> × 2H<sub>2</sub>O per liter; 10 μg of biotin and 10 mg of thiamine per liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Zevenhuizen and van Neerven 1983</xref>). As the strain exhibits chromosomally encoded streptomycin resistance, 250 µg/ml streptomycin was added to the media. For Ribo-seq sample preparation, cells corresponding to 40 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalent units were harvested after rapid chilling in an ice bath to halt cell growth and translation. In brief, cultures in the exponential phase (OD<sub>600nm</sub> 0.5) were rapidly placed in a pre-chilled flask in an ice-water bath and incubated with gentle shaking for 3 min. Cells were then immediately pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 6000 ×g) before snap-freezing in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Before centrifugation, a culture aliquot was withdrawn for total RNA analysis, mixed with 0.2 vol stop mix (5% buffer-saturated phenol [Roth] in 95% ethanol), and snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Even though translation elongation inhibitors have been extensively used in both eukaryotic and bacterial Ribo-seq workflows, using such chemicals can introduce bias into Ribo-seq coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gerashchenko and Gladyshev 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Mohammad et al. 2019</xref>).

In brief, cell pellets were resuspended with cold lysis buffer (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 150 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4% Triton X-100, 150 U DNase I [Fermentas], and 1000 U RNase Inhibitor [MoloX, Berlin] at pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication (constant power 50%, duty cycle 50%, and 3 × 30 s cycles with 30 s cooling on a water-ice bath between each sonication cycle to avoid heating of the sample). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. Approximately 15 A<sub>260</sub> of lysate 200 U of RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added. Polysome digestion was performed at 25°C with shaking at 650 rpm for 90 min. A mock-digested control (no enzyme added) was performed in parallel to confirm the presence of polysomes in the lysate. To analyze polysome profiles and recover digested monosomes, we layered 15 A<sub>260</sub> units onto a linear 10%–55% sucrose gradient prepared in 4X gradient buffer (10X gradient buffer: 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and 20 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] at pH 8.0) in an ultracentrifuge tube (13.2 mL Beckman Coulter SW-41). Gradients were centrifuged in a SW40-Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2 h and 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge. Gradients were processed using a gradient station (IP, Biocomp Instruments) fractionation system with continuous absorbance monitoring at 254 nm to resolve ribosomal subunit peaks. The 70S monosome fractions were collected and subjected to RNA extraction to purify the RNA footprints. RNA was extracted from fractions or cell pellets for total RNA using hot phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Roth) or hot phenol (Roth), respectively, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Sharma et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Venturini et al. 2020</xref>). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was depleted from 5 µg of DNase I-digested total RNA by subtractive hybridization with the Pan-Bacteria riboPOOLs (siTOOLs, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen). Total RNA was fragmented with an RNA fragmentation reagent (Ambion). Monosome RNA and fragmented total RNA were size selected (26–34 nt) on 15% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ingolia et al. 2012</xref>) using RNA oligonucleotides NI-19 and NI-20 as guides. RNA was cleaned and concentrated by isopropanol precipitation with 15 μg of GlycoBlue (Ambion) and dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O. cDNA libraries were prepared by Vertis Biotechnologie AG (Freising, Germany) using the adapter ligation protocol without fragmentation. First, an oligonucleotide adapter was ligated to the 3′ end of the RNA molecules. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and the 3′ adapter as the primer. The first strand of cDNA was purified, and the 5′ Illumina TruSeq sequencing adapter was ligated to the 3′ end of the antisense cDNA. The resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified to approximately 10–20 ng/μl using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase.

The 5′ UTR regions of translated mRNAs generally had a mean TE of ≥ 1, which possibly resulted from protection from RNase I trimming of the −16 nt region upstream of the start codon by the initiating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This feature was particularly prominent in the leader regions of mRNAs with short 5′ UTRs, indicating that they are partially protected from digestion by initiating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). In addition, some 5′ UTRs might contain translated upstream sORFs, such as <italic>trpL</italic> upstream of <italic>trpE</italic> (marked in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Melior et al. 2020</xref>). Although less pronounced than at the start codon, the translation-terminating ribosome also protects a certain 3′ UTR region from RNase digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Oh et al. 2011</xref>), explaining the slightly higher mean TE of 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

For example, Ribo-seq, RNA-seq data, and our computational ORF predictions based on Ribo-seq all indicated that the start of the sORF SM2011_c05019 (50 aa) is likely located downstream of the current annotation, implying a shorter sORF of 38 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additional sORFs whose annotation should be adjusted are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S7</xref>. Moreover, our data revealed additional ORFs that should be added to the genome annotation. For example, the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq read coverages indicate active expression (transcription and translation) upstream of the <italic>nnrU</italic> gene. However, no gene was predicted in this region of the GenBank 2014 annotation. HRIBO’s prediction tools indicated the potential for two non-annotated ORFs encoding 51 and 132 aa proteins upstream of the <italic>nnrU</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The 51 aa ORF is annotated in the related <italic>Sinorhizobium medicae</italic> and <italic>Ensifer adhaeren</italic>s, and in the latter, a homologous 142 aa ORF is annotated between the 51 aa sORF and <italic>nnrU</italic>.

Given that these ORF prediction tools neither consider RNA-seq data nor TE but only utilize ribosome occupancy, we decided to filter the predictions for those with RNA-seq and Ribo-seq RPKM values of ≥10 and mean TE of ≥ 0.5. In addition, we applied a stringent cut-off for the DeepRibo score (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>) that allowed the ORF candidate ranking, which led to 266 candidates of translated non-annotated sORFs. Manual curation of all candidates based on their Ribo-seq coverage left us with a list of 54 non-annotated sORFs, which we proposed with high confidence to be translated during growth of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S7</xref>).

Only a few were located in 3′ UTRs, on antisense transcripts and in an operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Moreover, the majority of the 54 sORFs (63%) were located in the chromosome, 22% on pSymA, and 15% on pSymB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), a distribution comparable to that of the annotated sORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).

Cells were cultured either in minimal GMS medium (same as for Ribo-seq) or in rich TY medium, and three complementary sample preparation approaches were used: 1) tryptic in-solution digest of all proteins (a standard proteomics approach), 2) solid phase enrichment (SPE) of small proteins with subsequent Lys-C digestion, and 3) SPE of small proteins without subsequent digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Approaches 2 and 3 can identify SEPs whose peptides are not within the detectable range (approximately 7 aa to 40 aa) upon a tryptic digest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Tyanova et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P36">For the DB searches, we first relied on a standard (full) iPtgxDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Omasits et al. 2017</xref>) that hierarchically integrates reference genome annotations, <italic>ab initio</italic> gene predictions, and <italic>in silico</italic> ORF predictions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). The overlap and differences of all annotation sources were captured and consolidated in a composite gene identifier. Moreover, a large but minimally redundant protein search DB (for more details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iptgxdb.expasy.org/creating_iptgxdbs/">https://iptgxdb.expasy.org/creating_iptgxdbs/</ext-link>) is created, as well as a GFF that allows researchers to overlay experimental evidence, such as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, or proteomics data. Individual iPtgxDBs must be prepared for different proteases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). For trypsin, the standard iPtgxDB contained close to 160k protein entries of approximately 103k annotation clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3.1</xref>), that is, genomic loci that share the stop codon but have different predicted protein start sites. Approximately 92% of the peptides unambiguously identify one protein entry, which are called class 1a peptides that facilitate downstream data analysis and allow to swiftly identify novel proteoforms or SEPs. Although standard iPtgxDBs are very large, when combined with stringent FDR filtering, they have provided convincing results in the past, that is, for the identification of novel SEPs that withstood independent validation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Omasits et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Melior et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bartel et al. 2020</xref>).

The SPE-based small protein enrichment steps uniquely identified 160 of these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Notably, the search against the small custom DB accounted for 112 unique identifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>), presumably due to improved search statistics.

Similar to the overall results, the two SPE approaches also added unique SEPs: while 45 of the 58 MS-detected SEPs were identified with standard trypsin-based digestion, 13 SEPs were uniquely identified after processing the samples with SPE and either a Lys-C digest (9 of 38 not covered by trypsin) or no proteolytic digest (6 of 30 not covered by trypsin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Most MS-identified SEPs were between 60 and 70 aa long (67%), and the smallest detected SEP was 20 aa long.

For SEP1 and SEP5, on top of the expected SEP-SPA bands, slow migrating bands at approximately 25 kDa (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>) were detected, which probably corresponded to a non-specific signal, as they were also detected in some EVC samples after lysate fractionation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p><p id="P41">The bands of the tagged SEP1 and SEP5 ran similarly, although SEP1 is smaller than SEP5, as indicated above the panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Probably, the aberrant migration of SEP1 is due to its acidic aa composition (pI of 4.18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Guan et al. 2015</xref>). SEP17 showed multiple bands, with a weak and fast migrating band at approximately 15 kDa, which probably corresponds to the monomeric SEP17-SPA protein, and three strong and slow migrating bands, which could indicate protein oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Overall, the translation of SEPs with alternative start codons, that is, GTG (SEP10 and SEP14) and TTG (SEP7), and of the five candidates missed in the GenBank (2014) annotation but included by Refseq (2017) (SEPs Nr. 4, 7, 10, 17, and 18), was validated. Importantly, this analysis confirmed the translation of six novel SEPs (SEPs Nr. 1, 6, 11, 13, 14, and 16), including two of the three SEP candidates shorter than 30 aa. Finally, our observation that 11 (out of 16) sORFs without MS support but with high confidence Ribo-seq data were validated in the Western blot analysis shows the power of Ribo-seq to detect novel translated sORFs.</p><p id="P42">Since the analysis of exclusive or predominant subcellular localization is valuable for linking hypothetical proteins without any annotation to some potential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Stekhoven et al. 2014</xref>), we decided to investigate the subcellular localization of the validated SPA-tagged SEPs by Western blot analysis of the supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). As expected, the predicted TMH-containing proteins SEP4, SEP6, SEP13, SEP16, and SEP20 were detected exclusively or predominantly in P100, which contains ribosomes and membranes, whereas the predicted cytoplasmic proteins SEP5 and SEP12 were detected exclusively in the S100 fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). The remaining eight SEPs were detected exclusively or partially in the P100 fraction, suggesting that they could be associated with membrane complexes or ribosomes (SEP10 and SEP18 show similarities to the ribosomal proteins S21 and L7/12) or be prone to aggregation in their recombinant, tagged form.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Conservation and potential functions of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> novel small proteins</title><p id="P43">As described above, we detected the translation of 48 sORFs missing in the GenBank 2014 and Refseq 2017 annotations (37 identified by Ribo-seq and additional 11 by MS), which we refer to as novel. Since conserved SEPs are likely to be functional, we used tBLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gertz et al. 2006</xref>) to examine the conservation of the proteins encoded by the 48 novel sORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S8</xref>). The tBLASTn searches were conducted in bacteria with parameters previously established to identify conserved bacterial sORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Allen et al. 2014</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). We found a wide range of conservation, from an sORF detected in only four <italic>S. meliloti</italic> strains overall, to sORFs conserved at different higher taxonomic levels, to highly conserved sORFs present in different bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Among the 14 sORFs encoding SEPs with &lt; 30 aa (excluding the tmRNA sORF64), four are conserved beyond <italic>S. meliloti</italic>. One of the most widely conserved novel SEPs is a 64-aa-long small protein detected only by MS (sORF61 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). It was identified as a product of an <italic>in silico</italic> predicted sORF, with 3 PSMs in lysates from MM cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). However, no expression at the level of RNA was detected at its locus, possibly suggesting high protein stability. sORF61 has homologs in several bacterial phyla and multiple paralogs, with a maximal aa sequence identity of 64% on each replicon in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011. Despite its wide distribution and strong conservation, its function is unknown. Overall, excluding the tmRNA, we detected seven sORFs conserved beyond the family <italic>Rhizobiaceae,</italic> suggesting that the corresponding SEPs may have important general functions.</p><p id="P44">Furthermore, we used TMHMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Krogh et al. 2001</xref>) and PSORTb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Yu et al. 2010</xref>) to predict the presence of transmembrane helices and the subcellular localization of the 48 novel SEPs. Localization in the cytoplasmic membrane was predicted for seven SEPs using at least one of the tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S8</xref>). Among them are the Ribo-seq-identified and Western blot analysis-validated SEP6 (prediction by both TMHMM and PSORTb) and SEP16 (prediction by TMHMM only), which were detected with strong signals predominantly in the P100 fraction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). The corresponding sORF6 and sORF16 are conserved in <italic>Hyphomicrobiales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). No proteins with predicted membrane localization were found among the 11 MS-detected SEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, two of the 48 novel SEPs harbor a predicted SpII cleavage site and are thus probably lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Lipoproteins play important roles in physiology, signaling, cell envelope structure, virulence, and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Kovacs-Simon et al. 2011</xref>); however, as we had previously reported, they are often missed in prokaryotic genome annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Omasits et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Moreover, we used Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kelley et al. 2015</xref>) to gain insights into the potential functions of novel SEPs with ≥ 30 aa by analyzing their similarity to proteins with known tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S8</xref>). Best hits with a confidence homology of ≥ 30% were obtained for eight novel SEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The highest confidence homology suggesting a function was obtained for the SEPs encoded by sORF38 (DNA binding; 18 of the 43 aa residues were modeled with 66% confidence homology; conserved in Alphaproteobacteria) and sORF34 (bleomycin resistance; 37 of the 39 aa residues were modeled with 92% confidence homology; conserved among Bacteria). The HmuP extension (sORF65 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) was modeled with 98% confidence along 59 of its 60 aa residues; however, according to Phyre2, the function of the hit was unknown. Overall, obtaining clear functional predictions was not possible even for conserved SEPs, most probably due to their small size.</p><p id="P46">We also suggest the functions for three annotated sORFs/SEPs with validated translation. SEP5 (added in the RefSeq 2017 annotation) is conserved only in <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic>. Its translation was detected with Ribo-seq and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). The SEP5 sORF contains a cluster of six threonine and three lysine codons near its 3′ ‘end and is located in the 5′ UTR of the aspartate dehydrogenase-encoding gene. Since aspartate is a part of the threonine and lysine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Vitreschak et al. 2004</xref>), our observation suggests that this sORF can be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the aspartate dehydrogenase gene in <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic>, and SEP5 is possibly a leader peptide. Furthermore, among the annotated SEPs with functional assignment, which were detected by MS, an entericidin A/B family lipoprotein was found (CP004140.1:2141558-2141716:-, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). The 52-aa-long protein has a predicted TMH and is conserved in Alphaproteobacteria. Its <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> homolog, the lipoprotein Atu8019, is involved in specific cell–cell interactions as a part of outer membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Knoke et al. 2020</xref>). Finally, an annotated small protein validated in this work by Ribo-seq and Western blot analysis (1 PSM in the MS) is the abovementioned SEP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). It contains a predicted TMH and is conserved in the Alphaproteobacteria, and its sORF is part of an uncharacterized cytochrome oxidase operon. This synteny suggests that SEP20 can participate in the assembly and/or function of the corresponding cytochrome oxidase complex, as previously shown for SEP CydX and cytochrome bd oxidase in <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sun et al. 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P47">In this work, we have developed and applied a Ribo-seq workflow to comprehensively map the translatome of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 under free-living conditions in a minimal medium.

However, in contrast to eukaryotic model systems, codon resolution has not yet been achieved in Ribo-seq analyses of bacteria (Cianciulli Sesso et al. 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Mohammad et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Vazquez-Laslop et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Venturini et al. 2020</xref>). Trapping ribosomes on mRNA and generating ribosome footprints have remained challenging, requiring careful optimization for each bacterial species. Our Ribo-seq workflow for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> includes ribosome trapping by rapid cooling of the culture without using antibiotics and cell lysis in an adapted buffer, followed by digestion of unprotected RNA by RNase I, which is not inactivated by the ribosomes of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). RNase I has the advantage of precisely cleaving at both 5′ and 3′ ends of ribosome-protected mRNA without sequence specificity, in contrast to the routinely used MNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bartholomäus et al. 2016</xref>).

The translated sORFs were found on all three replicons and had similar preferences for start and stop codons independently of whether they were annotated or novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The novel sORFs were generally shorter than the annotated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>), clearly showing the advantage of the Ribo-seq method for SEP discovery. Many of the novel sORFs were probably not annotated due to their location in short transcripts considered as non-coding RNAs or asRNAs or in 5′ and 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Several translated novel sORFs internal to annotated genes (nested ORFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Gray et al. 2022</xref>) were also predicted by our Ribo-seq data. However, they were excluded from the analysis as additional evidence is needed to confirm their existence. Targeted detection of translation initiation sites is useful in uncovering such sORFs by Ribo-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Meydan et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Weaver et al. 2019</xref>), a strategy beyond the scope of our study. However, the existence of an internal sORF predicted by Ribo-seq was supported by the MS detection of a novel, 34-aa-long SEP translated in a different frame in the genomic region encoding SM2011_b20335 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G</xref>; sORF59 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P51">A challenge in defining novel sORFs for any genome is that annotations from different reference genome annotation centers can differ substantially for an identical sequence and change over time; that is, CDS are being added but are also removed in more recent annotations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and the “master” <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). Accordingly, two of the 48 novel SEPs are now bona fide-predicted CDS in the latest RefSeq 2022 annotation, with MS-evidence of a single PSM found with the custom iPtgxDB, whereas two other Ribo-seq-identified sORFs have variable pseudogene status in different annotation releases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). iPtgxDBs, which integrate existing reference annotations and add <italic>in silico</italic> predicted ORFs in all six frames to virtually cover the entire protein coding potential of a prokaryote, can be used to overcome such problems and enable MS-based detection of novel SEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Omasits et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P52">Here, in addition to a standard large iPtgxDB of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Melior et al. 2020</xref>), we applied the concept of a small, custom iPtgxDB lacking <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and including the top predictions from our experimental Ribo-seq data. This custom iPtgxDB is approximately 20-fold smaller and benefits statistics and FDR estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Li et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Blakeley et al. 2012</xref>). Notably, although the identification of 11 <italic>in silico</italic> predicted novel sORFs was possible only with the standard iPtgxDB, the small iPtxDB contributed substantially to the validation of annotated sORFs, increasing the number of SEPs with experimental support by 10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The detection of more SEPs was also facilitated by applying three experimental approaches, two of which included enrichment of small proteins. The MS detection of enriched SEPs without a proteolytic digest, including, for example, the 12 aa proteolysis tag encoded by tmRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), shows that this method can be useful for the identification of SEPs.</p><p id="P53">The validation of translation by Western blot analysis for 15 out of 20 analyzed novel SEPs with Ribo-seq support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B–6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S7</xref>), only three of which were detected by MS with at least 2 PSMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>), underlines the power of the Ribo-seq technique for identification of translated sORFs. The example of SEP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; 59 aa, restriction endonuclease-like, conserved in <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic>), which was added to the RefSeq annotation 2017 and was detected by 2 PSMs using the small, custom iPtgxDB, illustrates the added value of the latter. Detection of translation for the novel SEP1 (23 aa, conserved in <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic>) by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>) and Ribo-seq (highest TE among the non-annotated translated sORFs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S7</xref>), even though it was identified by only 1 PSM in the MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E</xref>), suggests that putative SEPs with 1 PSM can be truly expressed, real small proteins. Similarly, the annotated SEP20 (46 aa, conserved in Alphaproteobacteria) was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>), although it had only 1 PSM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>) and did not pass the stringent manual evaluation of the Ribo-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S7</xref>). We suggest that the conservation analysis of putative SEPs, which have minimal MS evidence (e.g., 1 PSM) and/or correspond to sORFs that did not pass the very stringent manual curation of the Ribo-seq data, can help define SEP candidates with potentially important functions that can be validated and analyzed in the future.</p><p id="P54">Despite the lower sensitivity of MS compared with Ribo-seq, using MS we detected 16 additional SEPs that were not identified as translated by Ribo-seq. Eleven of them were novel, showing the importance of complementary methods for comprehensive analysis of bacterial small proteomes. The reported numbers of validated and novel sORFs and their encoded SEPs are affected by the somewhat arbitrary cut-off of 70 aa. In fact, our data provide evidence for the translation of three additional, non-annotated proteins below 100 aa, which are considered small in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Baumgartner et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kaulich et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">VanOrsdel et al. 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P55">The functions of small proteins are difficult to predict <italic>in silico</italic>, often because they are too small to harbor known protein domains or motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahrens et al. 2022</xref>). In addition, for SEPs smaller than 30 aa <italic>in silico</italic> analysis by Phyre2 is still impossible. Keeping these limitations in mind, we present a list of putative functions corresponding to Phyre2 best hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S8</xref>). Since modeling of a partial SEP sequence by Phyre2 may provide a hint of potential interactions with other proteins or protein complexes, we mention predictions based on greater than 30% confidence homology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, including the predicted DNA-binding function of the 43 aa SEP38 and a potential role in bleomycin resistance of the 39 aa SEP34. SEP function can also be predicted based on gene synteny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahrens et al. 2022</xref>), as mentioned above, for SEP5 (potential leader peptide encoded by a regulatory upstream sORF) and SEP20 encoded in a cytochrome oxidase operon. Our findings show that, excluding the tmRNA sORF, 13 out of the 48 novel SEPs (sORFs) are conserved in <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic>, seven in <italic>Hyphomicrobiales</italic>, and three in at least two bacterial phyla, which likely suggests physiological relevance. Most of the translated sORFs or SEPs were detected in logarithmic cultures grown in a minimal medium, where bacteria synthesize virtually all metabolites for cell reproduction.

LH established Ribo-seq for <italic>S. meliloti,</italic> performed the Ribo-seq analysis, manually examined the implied novel sORFs, explored evolutionary conservation, and predicted the function of novel SEPs. RG performed the bioinformatic processing of the Ribo-seq data. SM conducted the mass-spectrometry experiments, database searches and manually evaluated spectra implying novel SEPs. BH and CHA contributed to the proteogenomic analysis to identify the known and novel SEPs, explored the value of iPtgxDBs for Ribo-seq data, consolidated experimental results in a master table, and identified annotation differences. RS, SA, and SBW performed the cloning and Western blot analyses. LH, CHA, and EEH mainly wrote the manuscript with input and feedback from the other authors. DB, RB, CMS, CHA, and EEH supervised the research and provided resources and funding.

Ribo-seq workflow to map the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> 2011 translatome. Translating ribosomes (indicated by the polysome fraction) were first captured on the mRNAs. Unprotected mRNA regions were digested by RNase I, converting polysomes to monosomes. Approximately 30-nt-long footprints protected by and co-purified with 70S ribosomes were then subjected to cDNA library preparation and deep sequencing to identify the translatome under the used conditions. The small proteome was identified using HRIBO automated predictions and manual curation. Mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis of recombinant, tagged small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins were used to validate the translated sORFs. <bold>(B)</bold> Sucrose gradient fractionation of the lysates. Cells were harvested at the exponential growth phase by a fast-chilling method to avoid polysome run-off. RNase I digestion led to enrichment of monosomes (70S peak in the green profile) in contrast to the untreated sample (Mock, black profile). Absorbance at 254 nm was measured. <bold>(C)</bold> Integrated genome browser screenshots depicting reads from Ribo-seq and RNA-seq libraries for two annotated ORFs: <italic>rpsO</italic> encoding ribosomal protein S15 and <italic>icd</italic> encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase.

Standard iPtgxDB: Three peptides imply a 14 aa longer proteoform (60 aa) for HmuP than annotated; four peptides of the tmRNA-encoded proteolysis tag were identified; one peptide (3 peptide spectrum matches [PSMs]) implied a novel SEP (34 aa) internal to the genomic region that also encodes SM2011_b20335 but in a different frame.
