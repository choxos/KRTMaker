However, due to the coronavirus’s intrinsic nature, new variants emerged, such as Delta and Omicron, refractory to the vaccines derived using the original Wuhan strain. We developed an HERV-enveloped recombinant baculoviral DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV2 (AcHERV-COVID19S). A non-replicating recombinant baculovirus that delivers the SARS-CoV2 spike gene showed a protective effect against the homologous challenge in a K18-hACE2 Tg mice model; however, it offered only a 50% survival rate against the SARS-CoV2 Delta variant. Therefore, we further developed the AcHERV-COVID19 Delta vaccine (AcHERV-COVID19D). Cross-protection experiments revealed that mice vaccinated with the AcHERV-COVID19D showed 100% survival upon challenge with Delta and Omicron variants and 71.4% survival against prototype SARS-CoV2. These results support the potential of the viral vector vaccine, AcHERV-COVID19D, in preventing the spread of coronavirus variants such as Omicron and SARS-CoV2 variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 vaccine</kwd><kwd>Baculoviral DNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 Variants</kwd><kwd>AcHERV-COVID19 Delta vaccine</kwd><kwd>Cross protection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. SARS-CoV2 vaccines were rapidly developed following the global emergence of this pandemic, and the vaccine benefit has been shown to significantly lower mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, the emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VOC) reduced potency of existing prototype vaccines are driving the development of vaccines that could provide protection against VOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P3">We previously developed a SARS-CoV2 prototype vaccine using a baculoviral vector system and evaluated the efficacy of the developed AcHERV-COVID19S prototype vaccine in Syrian golden hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In this study, we confirmed the efficacy of the AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Additionally, we developed the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine that delivers the spike gene of the SARS-CoV2 Delta variant. The primary focus of this study was to assess the efficacy of the AcHERV-COVID19D against the SARS-CoV2 Delta variant. Given the rising prevalence of the Omicron variant, we further assessed the cross-protection ability of the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine against this variant in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice.</p><p id="P4">Developing customized vaccines against new variants has a limitation in that it cannot keep up with new VOCs due to the need for long-term vaccine development. Therefore, we also performed a cross-protection evaluation against the SARS-CoV2 prototype, Delta, and Omicron variants to study the potential of AcHERV-COVID19D as a vaccine against emerging VOCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction and immunogenicity of AcHERV-COVID19 vaccines</title><p id="P5">A baculovirus-based COVID19 DNA vaccine, the AcHERV-COVID19 prototype vaccine (termed AcHERV-COVID19S) was constructed to deliver the spike gene of the SARS-CoV2 prototype (Wuhan). To develop the recombinant baculovirus containing the SARS-CoV2 Delta variant, the RBD-to-S1 sequence of the AcHERV-COVID19 prototype was replaced with that from the Delta variant termed AcHERV-COVID19D. To enhance the immunogenicity of the spike protein, we substituted two prolines at residues K986 and V987 and removed the polybasic cleavage site by R685N (RRAR to RRAN), as suggested in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). A schematic diagram of the recombinant baculoviruses encoding SARS-CoV2 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. To characterise S antigen expression, Vero E6 cells infected with AcHERV-COVID19S or AcHERV-COVID19D were evaluated by immunofluorescence assay and Western blotting using spike-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AcHERV-COVID19S protects against SARS-CoV2 challenge in K18-hACE2 mice</title><p id="P6">To evaluate the immunogenicity of the AcHERV-COVID19S (prototype), Six-week-old female K18-ACE2 mice were immunized with AcHERV-COVID19S twice intramuscularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>). Two weeks after boosting vaccination, all vaccinated mice showed induction of SARS-CoV2-specific total IgG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). But the level of neutralising antibodies was not as high as seen in the serum of an individual who had received commercial vaccines (positive control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To test the prophylactic effect of the AcHERV-COVID19S, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV2 (prototype). After SARS-CoV2 infection, the mice from the non-treatment control (NTC) group lost more than 17.4% of their initial body weight, and all died on the 9th day. The AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine group showed mild weight loss and symptoms but recovered rapidly over 13 days and exhibited 100% survival with good health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D–E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The results of histopathological analysis of mouse lung tissues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F–G</xref>. Seven days after infection, lung tissues of the AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine group showed a significantly milder pathology upon SARS-CoV2 infection. Unlike the vaccine group, NTC mice showed severe lesions, perivascular and alveolar infiltration, and severe inflammation compared to the lungs of normal mice. On day 13 post-challenge, viral titres were measured from the lung tissues of all surviving mice using qRT-PCR. The virus was weakly detected in mice at this point but was below the lower limit of detection in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Thus, although AcHERV-COVID19S vaccinated mice did not show complete sterile protection, all such mice recovered and survived.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the recovery after SARS-CoV2 infection</title><p id="P9">To measure the cellular immunity-inducing effects of the vaccine, an additional experiment was performed using C57BL/6 mice. An ELISPOT assay revealed that the level of IFN-γ-secreting splenocytes was significantly higher in AcHERV-COVID19S vaccinated mice compared to control mice (*: <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig A</xref>). We also measured the induction of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines by qRT-PCR. TNF-α and IL-2 were used to assess Th1-type levels, while IL-4 was used to assess Th2-type cytokines. We found that the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-4 were higher in the immunized group than in the NTC group. The vaccinated group showed greater Th1 cell immune responses and maintained higher Th1 cytokine mRNA levels than the NTC group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig. B</xref>). This finding demonstrated importance of the Th1-skewed immune response in protecting against infection and reducing the clinical severity of subsequent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the ability of AcHERV-COVID19S to induce strong cellular immunity plays an important role in the recovery of vaccinated K18-hACE2 transgenic mice after SARS-CoV2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Immunogenicity comparison of AcHERV-COVID19S prototype and AcHERV-COVID19D delta vaccine</title><p id="P10">To compare the immunogenicity of the AcHERV-COVID19D delta vaccine with that of the AcHERV-COVID19S (prototype vaccine), SARS-CoV2-specific humoral immune responses were evaluated in K18-ACE2 mice. K18-ACE2 mice were immunized twice intramuscular injection into the hind legs with AcHERV-COVID19S or AcHERV-COVID19D at a 4-week interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Table</xref>). Compared to the AcHERV-COVID19S, the AcHERV-COVID19D delta vaccine showed significantly improved SARS-CoV2 S-specific IgG titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; AcHERV-COVID19S vs. AcHERV-COVID19D *: P &lt; 0.05). Two weeks after the second vaccination, the neutralizing antibody titres of sera from AcHERV-COVID19D and AcHERV-COVID19S-immunised mice were evaluated against SARS-CoV2 prototype and Delta variant viruses. As expected, the sera of AcHERV-COVID19D immunized mice had a high neutralizing antibody titre against the homologous Delta virus, which was higher than that of AcHERV-COVID19S immunized mouse sera. In contrast, the heterologous neutralizing antibody titre of delta vaccine-immunized mice was much lower (by about 4-fold) for the prototype SARS-CoV2 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>AcHERV-COVID19D can protect against the homologous pathogenic SARS-CoV2 Delta variant</title><p id="P11">To test the prophylactic effects of the AcHERV-COVID19D, mice immunized with AcHERV-COVID19S or AcHERV-COVID19D were challenged with the SARS-CoV2 Delta variant. After the challenge, the mice of the NTC group lost more than 22.35% of their initial body weight, and all died by day 9. In contrast, the mice from the AcHERV-COVID19D delta group (N=14) appeared healthy, with maintained weight, and all survived SARS-CoV2 Delta infection until the study endpoint (day 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D–E</xref>). The AcHERV-COVID19S group (N = 14) exhibited weight loss, symptoms, and 50% mortality (7 of 14 mice). This suggests that the AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine did not effectively offer cross-protection against SARS-CoV2 Delta infection.</p><p id="P12">On day 13, all surviving mice were humanely euthanized, lungs were isolated, and the virus titre was measured (Lungs of NTC were isolated on day 9). Notably, there was no detectable virus in the lungs of mice immunized with AcHERV-COVID19D. In contrast, high virus titres were present in the lungs of mice from the AcHERV-COVID19S and NTC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Additionally, histopathological analysis of lungs from vaccinated mice showed reduced histopathological symptoms, and histological scores also showed a similar decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G–H</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Together, these results indicate that AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine showed perfect protection against the homologous pathogenic SARS-CoV2 Delta variant without the lung inflammation and/or injury associated with SARS-CoV2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cross-protection evaluation of AcHERV-COVID-19D DNA vaccine in K18-ACE2 Tg mice</title><p id="P14">As new SARS-CoV2 variants emerged, we performed Omicron cross-protection tests using the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccines. For this experiment, replication-incompetent adenoviral vector vaccines were constructed as a control to deliver the spike genes for the SARS-CoV2 prototype or Delta variants. The principle underlying this vaccine is the same as that of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and its characterization is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>.</p><p id="P15">To examine the cross-reactivity to the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine, 112 mice were divided into 13 groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, and an experiment was carried out. Groups 2, 7, and 11 (total n=28) were immunized with the AcHERV-COVID19D delta vaccine and challenged with three different SARS-CoV2 viruses. Groups 3 and 8 (each n=7) immunized with adenovirus vectored COVID19S vaccine were challenged with SARS-COV2 Delta and prototype, respectively. Groups 4, 9, and 12 (each n=7) immunized with adenovirus vectored COVID19D vaccine were challenged with SARS-CoV2 Delta and Omicron, respectively.</p><p id="P16"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the neutralizing antibody titres against the prototype, Delta, and Omicron viruses in the sera of 28 mice immunized with the AcHERV-COVID19D (Groups 2, 7, 11).

In contrast, titres of 640 and 320 were obtained for the prototype and Omicron SARS-CoV2 strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To measure the cellular immunity of the vaccine against various SARS-CoV2 strains, an additional experiment was performed using the ELISPOT assay. Mice vaccinated with AcHERV-COVID19D showed significantly higher levels of IFN-γ secreted from splenocytes against three SARS-CoV2 strains without a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P17"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C–4H</xref> shows the body weight and survival rate against the prototype, Delta, and Omicron viruses in mice immunized with the AcHERV-COVID19D.

The pathological results of lung tissue in the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccinated group were weaker lesions and significantly reduced viral load compared to the NTC group. The body weight, survival rate, histological analysis, and viral load results confirmed that our AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine provided perfect protection against the Delta virus. We also confirmed a high level of protection against the prototype virus. In the case of the Omicron variant, the mice in the NTC group died on day 14, showing heavy viral load and lesions in histological analysis. The AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine group showed a 100% survival rate against the Omicron virus. The histological examination showed a low lesion phenomenon and a significantly low viral load.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">We had previously developed MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, and Zika virus vaccines using a baculovirus-based DNA vaccine (AcHERV) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that AcHERV-COVID19D could be a potential SARS-CoV2 vaccine against pathogenic Delta and Omicron variants. Polybasic cleavage site-modified AcHERV-COVID19D elicited stronger humoral and cellular immunity than the AcHERV-COVID19S. Although the AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine induced low NA, vaccinated mice showed 100% survival against homologous SARS-CoV2 virus challenge. These findings suggest that the cellular immunity conferred by AcHERV-COVID19S played a vital role in the recovery of mice after SARS-CoV2 infection. This ability to induce cellular immunity can be an advantage of mRNA and viral-vector DNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, the non-modified AcHERV-COVID19S vaccine showed a 50% survival rate against highly pathogenic heterologous SARS-CoV2 Delta. This indicates that humoral immunity is also very important against the virulent Delta variant, emphasizing that vaccines should seek to induce both cellular and humoral immunity.</p><p id="P20">The continuous emergence of VOCs has become the biggest problem in efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Notably, AcHERV-COVID19D conferred 100% protection in mice challenged with the Omicron variant, whose spike protein differs from that of Delta by 34 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We speculate that the cross-protection ability of AcHERV-COVID19D may be related to the virulence of a given virus. The ability of the AcHERV-COVID19D to cross-protect against Omicron is beyond the level expected for the observed neutralizing antibody activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that cellular immunity is involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Although weight loss was observed, the adenoviral delta vaccine (Ad-COVID19D) group also showed 100% survival following the Omicron challenge. The Ad-COVID19D is replication-incompetent in mice, it expresses all adenoviral genes except for the IE3 gene and thus exerts viral toxicity. In contrast, a baculovirus vector vaccine is non-toxic; most baculoviral gene promoters are not recognized by RNA polymerase II, and thus the virus-derived proteins cannot be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Also, because of this silence, there are no challenges associated with vector antibodies. Thus, the AcHERV vaccine system could be implemented for developing a booster vaccine.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, AcHERV-COVID19D elicited higher humoral and cellular immunity and showed perfect protection against SARS-CoV2 delta strain and Omicron challenge. The broad and robust cellular immunity of the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine appears to have played a significant role in the cross-protection of the Omicron variant. Our AcHERV-COVID19D can be a potential vaccine against emerging SARS-CoV2 variants.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Viruses and cells</title><p id="P23"><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> 9 (Sf9, Invitrogen, USA) cells were propagated in Sf-900II medium (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, USA) at 27°C.

For SARS-CoV2-N, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed by heating the slides in a pressure cooker on the steam setting for 10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer and subsequently blocking the endogenous peroxidase using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The slides were incubated with primary rabbit anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody(NB100-56576, Novus, USA) overnight at 4°C and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (Abcam, UK) for 1 hr. Thereafter, 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (Takara, Japan) was added. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin according to our experimental protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series to xylene.

We developed a baculoviral COVID19 DNA vaccine for the Delta variant (AcHERV-COVIS19D). Compared to AcHERV-COVID19S, designed to protect from the prototype of SARS-CoV2, AcHERV-COVID19D elicited higher humoral and cellular immunity and showed perfect protection against SARS-CoV2 delta strain and Omicron challenge. The broad and robust cellular immunity of the AcHERV-COVID19D vaccine appears to have played a significant role in the cross-protection of the Omicron variant.
