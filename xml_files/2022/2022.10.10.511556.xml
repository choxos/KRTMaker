Although the primary sequence and phosphorylation pattern of GPCRs are poorly conserved, the downstream functional responses mediated by βarrs such as receptor desensitization, endocytosis and signaling are broadly applicable across GPCRs. A conserved principle of βarr activation, if any, upon their interaction with different GPCRs harboring divergent phosphorylation patterns remains to be visualized, and it represents a major knowledge gap in our current understanding of GPCR signaling and regulatory paradigms. Here, we present four structural snapshots of activated βarrs, in complex with distinct phosphorylation patterns derived from the carboxyl-terminus of three different GPCRs, determined using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures of activated βarrs elucidate a “lock-and-key” type conserved mechanism of βarr activation wherein a P-X-P-P phosphorylation pattern in GPCRs interacts with a spatially organized K-K-R-R-K-K sequence in the N-domain of βarrs. Interestingly, the P-X-P-P pattern simultaneously engages multiple structural elements in βarrs responsible for maintaining the basal conformation, and thereby, leads to efficient βarr activation. The conserved nature of this lock-and-key mechanism is further illustrated by a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human GPCRome, and demonstrated in cellular context with targeted mutagenesis including “loss-of-function” and “gain-of-function” experiments with respect to βarr activation measured by an intrabody-based conformational sensor. Taken together, our findings uncover previously lacking structural insights, which explain the ability of distinct GPCRs to activate βarrs through a common mechanism, and a key missing link in the conceptual framework of GPCR-βarr interaction and resulting functional outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GPCRs</kwd><kwd>Arrestins</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>biased-agonism</kwd><kwd>cellular signaling</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are characterized by their universal seven transmembrane architecture, and agonist-induced coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins and β-arrestins (βarrs). Of these, βarrs are multifunctional cytosolic proteins critically involved in regulating the signaling and trafficking of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>). Their interaction with GPCRs involves a major contribution from receptor phosphorylation, which not only drives the affinity of receptor-βarr interaction but also imparts functionally competent active conformation in βarrs driving downstream functional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maharana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ranjan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). Additional interaction of βarrs with the receptor transmembrane core and membrane lipid bilayer induces further structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Eichel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Eichel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shiraishi et al., 2021</xref>), which also fine-tune the functional capabilities of βarrs and possibly spatio-temporal aspects of their regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Asher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">John Janetzko, 2022</xref>). Despite a poorly conserved primary sequence of GPCRs in terms of the number and spatial positioning of the putative phosphorylation sites, the near-universal nature of βarr interaction, ensuing signaling and regulatory responses, remain to be fully understood at molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen and Tesmer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Seyedabadi et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, differential receptor phosphorylation by different subtypes of GPCR kinases (GRKs), and possibly other kinases, in cell-type specific manner adds further complexity to GPCR-βarr binding modalities and context-specific functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kawakami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Matthees et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">There are two isoforms of βarrs namely βarr1 and 2, also known as Arrestin 2 and 3, respectively, and despite a high degree of sequence and structural similarity, they often exhibit a significant diversity in their functional contribution towards GPCR signaling and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drube et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). There are only a very few structures of βarr1 in active conformation, either in complex with receptor-derived phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>), or, in complex with agonist-bound, phosphorylated GPCRs (Cao; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Staus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). The structural coverage for βarr2 is even more sparse with the structural snapshots limited to either a complex with CXCR7-derived phosphopeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Min et al., 2020</xref>) or in IP6-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). While these structures provide useful information about βarrs’ interaction with the receptors, there is only a limited information available about the phosphorylation patterns either due to chimeric constructs used in these studies or the lack of visualization of multiple phosphorylation sites resulting from insufficient structural resolution. Thus, the quest to decipher precise molecular details of βarr activation, especially a potentially conserved mechanism by which they can interact with a large repertoire of receptors harboring different phosphorylation patterns, remains open. This represents a major knowledge gap in our current understanding of GPCR signaling and regulatory paradigms governing and fine-tuning the signal-transduction through this versatile class of receptors.</p><p id="P5">In this backdrop, here we present cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of full length βarr1 and 2 activated by defined phosphorylation patterns encoded in the form of phosphopeptides, which are derived from three different GPCRs namely the complement C5a receptor subtype 1 (C5aR1), the CXC chemokine receptor subtype 4 (CXCR4) and the vasopressin receptor subtype 2 (V2R). These structural snapshots reveal that a P-X-P-P pattern of phosphorylation in GPCRs engages a K-K-R-R-K-K sequence in the N-domain of βarrs forming a “lock-and-key” type interaction interface that directs βarr activation. Interestingly, a large repertoire of GPCRs encode putative P-X-P-P motif either in their carboxyl-terminus, or, the 3<sup>rd</sup> intracellular loop (ICL3), suggesting the conserved nature of this activation mechanism. We validate this mechanism in cellular context on a set of distinct receptors using conformational biosensors and structure-guided modification of the P-X-P-P key leading to “gain-of-function” and “loss-of-function” with respect to βarr activation. Collectively, our data reveal conserved principles of βarr activation, and provide a structural mechanism that guides phosphorylation-dependent βarr activation by GPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">Although cryo-EM has been used to determine the structures of GPCR-βarr1 complexes (Cao; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Staus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), all the previous structures of βarrs in basal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>), bound to phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>) or IP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) have been determined using X-ray crystallography. Therefore, in order to test the feasibility of structure determination of βarrs in complex with different phosphorylation patterns encoded in GPCR phosphopeptides by cryo-EM, we first reconstituted V2Rpp-βarr1 complex together with a set of conformationally selective Fabs, which recognize activated βarr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequently, we analyzed these complexes using negative-staining single particle EM, which revealed monodisperse particle distribution and 2D class averages where the densities of βarr1 and Fabs were clearly discernible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Based on these observations, we synthesized and characterized a set of phosphopeptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminus of the human complement C5a receptor subtype 1 (C5aR1) and the CXC chemokine receptor subtype 4 (CXCR4), and assessed their ability to activate βarr1 measured in terms of Fab30 reactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B-S1E</xref>). We identified the phosphorylation patterns from C5aR1 (C5aR1pp2; referred to as C5aR1pp hereon) and CXCR4 (CXCR4pp2; referred to as CXCR4pp hereon), which elicited maximal Fab30 reactivity as a measure of βarr1 activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B-S1E</xref>). Subsequently, we reconstituted C5aR1pp-βarr1-Fab30 and CXCR4pp-βarr1-Fab30 complexes, validated their monodispersity and architecture using negative-staining EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F and S1G</xref>), and subjected these complexes to cryo-EM. We successfully determined the structures of C5aR1pp-βarr1 -Fab30 and CXCR4pp-βarr1 -Fab30 complexes at global resolutions of 3.4 Å and 4.8 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>βarr1 structures in complex with C5aR1 and CXCR4 phosphorylation patterns</title><p id="P7">Both structures revealed a dimeric arrangement with the two βarr1 protomers making dimeric contacts through the C-edge loops and finger loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). βarr1 protomers exhibit nearly-identical overall structures with each other (RMSD, 0.08 Å for C5aR1pp-βarr1 and RMSD 0.15 Å for CXCR4pp-βarr1) with clear densities of the phosphopeptides visible in the EM map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A and 3B</xref>). C5aR1pp and CXCR4pp are positioned in a positively-charged groove on the N-domain of βarr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>), and the phosphate moieties make extensive contacts with Arg/Lys residues at the binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). Interestingly, three phosphate groups arranged in a P-X-P-P type pattern, where P is a phosphorylated residue and X is another amino acid, in both the phosphopeptides engage a nearly-identical set of Lys/Arg residues in βarr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). Specifically, pT<sup>336</sup>-R<sup>337</sup>-pS<sup>338</sup>-pT<sup>339</sup> pattern in C5aR1pp and pS<sup>344</sup>-E<sup>345</sup>-pS<sup>346</sup>-pS<sup>347</sup> pattern in CXCR4pp engages K<sup>294</sup>-K<sup>11</sup>-R<sup>25</sup> -R<sup>7</sup>-K<sup>10</sup>-K<sup>107</sup> in βarr1. The other phosphate groups present in the phosphopeptides are either not involved in a direct contact with Arg/Lys, sparsely linked with Arg/Lys, or, positioned outside the binding groove. The N- and C-domains of βarr1 exhibit an inter-domain rotation of approximately 20° when compared to the basal state of βarr1, in both the structures, which is a hallmark of βarr activation upon binding of phosphorylated GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, the three major loops in βarr1 namely the finger, middle and lariat loop also exhibit significant reorientation upon binding of C5aR1pp and CXCR4pp compared to the basal state although their positioning is almost identical between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Finally, the three-element interaction and polar-core network in βarr1 are also disrupted upon binding to C5aR1pp and CXCR4pp when compared to the basal state structure through the displacement of carboxyl-terminus of βarr1 from the N-domain and repositioning of the lariat loop through the interaction of K<sup>294</sup> with a phosphate moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>). These structural features and interaction interface are analogous to that observed in V2Rpp-βarr1-Fab30 crystal structure determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>), although the primary sequence and phosphorylation patterns encoded by C5aR1pp and CXCR4pp are distinct from V2Rpp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structure-guided engineering yields structures of activated βarr2</title><p id="P8">As mentioned earlier, the structural coverage of active βarrs, either in complex with full GPCRs or GPCR-derived phosphopeptides, is limited primarily to βarr1. Activated structures of the other isoform i.e., βarr2 are represented only by an IP6-bound crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and a complex of truncated βarr2 with a phosphopeptide derived from a βarr- biased 7TMR (CXCR7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Min et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we set out to reconstitute and determine the structure of βarr2 in complex with the phosphopeptides derived from different receptors, i.e., C5aR1pp and CXCR4pp using cryo-EM. Surprisingly however, we did not observe a significant Fab30 reactivity to C5aR1pp/CXCR4pp-bound βarr2 while it robustly recognized V2Rpp-βarr2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the Fab30 interaction interface on C5aR1pp-bound βarr1 structure to identify a potential reason for the lack of Fab30 reactivity with βarr2. Interestingly, we observed that Fab30 epitope is conserved between βarr1 and 2 except two residues i.e., instead of F<sup>277</sup> and A<sup>279</sup> as in βarr1, βarr2 contains L<sup>278</sup> and S<sup>280</sup> in the corresponding positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, we generated a βarr2 mutant, referred to as βarr2<sup>DM</sup>, and tested its reactivity to Fab30 upon activation by distinct phosphopeptides. In line with our hypothesis, we observed a robust interaction of Fab30 with C5aR1pp-βarr2<sup>DM</sup> and CXCR4pp-βarr2<sup>DM</sup> complex, and we also noticed that the interaction of Fab30 with V2Rpp-βarr2<sup>DM</sup> was further enhanced compared to βarr2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also confirmed that βarr2<sup>DM</sup> exhibits a similar pattern of interaction as βarr2<sup>WT</sup> with V2R and C5aR1 in cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and shows near-identical endosomal trafficking as βarr2<sup>WT</sup> upon stimulation of V2R and C5aR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, βarr2<sup>DM</sup> provides us an excellent handle to reconstitute stable complexes with receptor phosphopeptides suitable for cryo-EM. In fact, we successfully managed to reconstitute monodisperse V2Rpp-βarr2<sup>DM</sup>-Fab30 and C5aR1pp-βarr2<sup>DM</sup>-Fab30 complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C and S5I</xref>) and determine their cryo-EM structures at 4.2 Å and 4.4 Å resolution, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D-S5H, S5J-S5N</xref>). In order to simplify the discussion, we refer to βarr2<sup>DM</sup> as βarr2 from here onwards unless specified otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structures of βarr2 in complex with V2Rpp and C5aR1pp</title><p id="P9">The V2Rpp-βarr2 and C5aR1pp-βarr2 structures exhibited a trimeric assembly of βarr2 with the individual protomers arranged through N- to C-domain contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). The overall structural features of the individual protomers in each structure were nearly identical as reflected by low RMSD (0.005 Å for V2Rpp-βarr2 and 0.038 Å for C5aR1pp-βarr2) with the phosphopeptide densities clearly visible in the EM maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3C and S3D</xref>). Like βarr1 structures, V2Rpp and C5aR1pp are positioned in a positively-charged groove on the N-domain of βarr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E and 4F</xref>), and the phosphate moieties make extensive contacts with Arg/Lys residues at the binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). Remarkably, we observed that three phosphate groups arranged in a P-X-P-P pattern in the phosphopeptides, engaged an analogous set of Lys/Arg residues as in βarr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures5A and 5B</xref>). Specifically, pT<sup>360</sup>-A<sup>361</sup>-pS<sup>362</sup>-pS<sup>363</sup> in V2Rpp and pT<sup>336</sup>-R<sup>337</sup>-pS<sup>338</sup>-pT<sup>339</sup> in C5aR1pp engage K<sup>295</sup>-K<sup>12</sup>-R<sup>26</sup> -R<sup>8</sup>-K<sup>11</sup>-K<sup>108</sup> in βarr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). Similar to βarr1 structures, the other phosphate groups present in the phosphopeptides are either not involved in a direct contact with Arg/Lys or positioned outside the binding groove. The N- and C-domains of βarr2 exhibit an inter-domain rotation of approximately 25° when compared to the basal state of βarr2 in both the structures, which is relatively higher from that observed in phosphopeptide bound βarr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, the three major loops in βarr2 namely the finger, middle and lariat loop also exhibit significant reorientation upon binding of V2Rpp and C5aR1pp compared to the basal state although their positioning is almost identical between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, the three-element interaction and polar-core network in βarr2 are also disrupted upon binding to V2Rpp and C5aR1pp when compared to the basal state structure through the displacement of carboxyl-terminus of βarr2 from the N- domain and repositioning of the lariat loop through the interaction of K<sup>295</sup> with a phosphate moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A conserved “lock-and-key” mechanism of βarr activation</title><p id="P10">As mentioned earlier, the analysis of these structural snapshots in terms of phosphorylation sites revealed a conserved P-X-P-P pattern with nearly-identical interactions with analogous residues in βarr1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A-6C</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the primary sequence of all non-olfactory and non-orphan GPCRs in their carboxyl-terminus and intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) to identify the occurrence of P-X-P-P pattern in these receptors (Supplementary Table S2). We observed that a large set of GPCRs harbored this motif in their carboxyl-terminus sequence and several receptors also included it in their ICL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F and 6G</xref>). In order to validate the functional contribution of this motif in GPCR-induced βarr activation, we employed Ib30-based conformational biosensor in cellular context using three different receptors, which possess P-X-P-P motif either in their C-terminus (CXCR3), ICL3 (M2R), or, lack it (CXCR7). At the level of βarr1 conformation, Ib30 sensor reports the degree (&gt;15°) of inter-domain rotation as a proxy of βarr activation upon its interaction with activated and phosphorylated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dwivedi-Agnihotri et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed robust reactivity of Ib30 sensor with βarr1 for CXCR3 and M2R but not for CXCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). To further corroborate these findings, we used two different receptors namely, the Bradykinin receptor subtype 2 (B2R) and C5aR1 for structure-based targeted mutagenesis to probe “gain-of-function” and “loss-of-function”, respectively, in terms of Ib30 reactivity pattern. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7B and 7C</xref>, activation of the wild-type B2R fails to induce an interaction between βarr1 and Ib30 as it lacks a P-X-P-P motif in its C-terminus, although B2R is capable of recruiting βarrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baidya et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zimmerman et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly however, reconstitution of P-X-P-P motif in B2R by double mutation (ΔG<sup>368</sup>+L<sup>370</sup>T) results in a robust Ib30 reactivity upon agonist-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Along the same lines, a mutant version of C5aR1pp, where the P-X-P-P motif is disrupted by insertion of an additional arginine residue between pT<sup>336</sup> and pS<sup>338</sup>, completely loses the ability to induce a conformation that is recognizable by Fab30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Moreover, the corresponding mutation in C5aR1 also leads to a dramatic loss of Ib30 reactivity in cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Taken together these data establish the P-X-P-P phosphorylation pattern in GPCRs as a “key” to open the “lock” in βarrs leading to its conformational activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">The identification of conserved principles that guide the interaction and conformational activation of βarrs with a large repertoire of GPCRs has been a major challenge, and the structural snapshots of βarr1 and 2 presented here with distinct phosphorylation patterns derived from different receptors provide a breakthrough. The “P-X-P-P key” present in these phosphorylation patterns appear to be sufficient to simultaneously engage the crucial “lock points” in βarrs to facilitate their activation. It is intriguing that the binding interface of “P-X-P-P key” is conserved not only across different peptides irrespective of their primary sequence but also for both βarr isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6D and 6E</xref>). This conserved binding interface and corresponding interactions ensure the displacement of βarrs’ C-terminus from the N-domain and repositioning of the lariat loop, leading to the release of the two major “breaks” on βarr activation namely, the three-element interaction and the polar-core network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). It is important to note that GPCRs lacking the P-X-P-P pattern are also capable of recruiting βarrs in functionally competent conformation; however, they are likely to induce an active βarr conformation that is distinct from the receptors harboring the P-X-P-P key. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that for some receptors, a functional “P-X-P-P key” may not be formed despite having a suitable primary sequence because all the phosphorylatable residues may not undergo phosphorylation in cellular context. A previous study has proposed a framework of “full” and “partial” phosphorylation codes imparting distinct βarr recruitment patterns for GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Our study now identifies and establishes a general principle of efficient βarr activation through a specific phosphorylation pattern encoded in GPCRs engaging a conserved interface on βarrs.</p><p id="P12">An intriguing observation in these structural snapshots is novel dimer and trimer assemblies of βarrs. Although βarrs have strong propensity to adopt different oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2022</xref>), the dimer and trimer interfaces observed here differ significantly from previously reported interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). The overall buried surface area in dimer and trimer assemblies are approximately 1500 Å<sup>2</sup> and 4500 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively, suggesting a robust and stable oligomeric arrangement. The two protomers in C5aR1pp- and CXCR4pp-bound βarr1 interface with each other through multiple hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, and non-bonded contacts in a manner where the C-edge loop residues of one protomer are positioned into the central crest of the other protomer in proximity of the finger loop. An analogous set of interactions are also involved in trimer arrangement of βarr2 in complex with V2Rpp and C5aR1pp. Interestingly, a previous crystal structure of βarr2 in complex with IP6 also shows a trimeric arrangement although the trimer interface is different from that observed here in phosphopeptide-bound conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). A comprehensive map of dimer and trimer interface with residue-level contacts is listed in Supplementary Table S3. Considering the functional multiplicity of βarrs in terms of distinct signaling and regulatory outcomes and receptor-specific responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2019</xref>), it is plausible that distinct oligomeric interfaces in βarrs may be a modular mechanism to fine-tune the functional contributions by providing distinct possibilities for adaptable protein-protein interaction interfaces for binding partners.</p><p id="P13">The comparison of V2Rpp- and C5aR1pp-bound βarr1 and 2 reveal a significantly higher inter-domain rotation in βarr2 compared to βarr1 as hypothesized earlier based on cellular and biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>), and this may provide a plausible explanation for functional differences between the βarr isoforms as observed for multiple GPCRs. It is also noteworthy that the structural snapshots presented here involve isolated phosphopeptides with defined phosphorylation patterns without the transmembrane core of the receptors. As the interaction of receptor core imparts additional conformational changes in βarrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Latorraca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shiraishi et al., 2021</xref>), it is plausible that the full complexes of receptors and βarrs may exhibit additional conformational changes in βarrs, especially in terms of the positioning of the proximal region of the phosphorylated segment. However, the conserved principle of “P-X-P-P key” to open the “K-K-R-R-K-K lock” is likely to be maintained and guide βarr activation even in the context of full receptors.</p><p id="P14">In summary, we identify and experimentally validate a conserved principle of phosphorylation-induced βarr activation based on structural snapshots of activated βarrs in complex with distinct receptor phosphorylation patterns. Our study addresses a long-standing question in the field to decipher the molecular basis of universal βarr activation by receptor phosphorylation, and lays the foundation to further refine the conceptual framework of βarr-mediated signaling and regulation of 7TMRs.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>General reagents, plasmids, and cell culture</title><p id="P15">Most of the general reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless mentioned otherwise.

For each experiment, 3 μg of indicated receptors, 2 μg of SmBiT-βarr2<sup>WT/DM</sup>, and 5 μg of LgBiT-FYVE were used.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>NanoBiT assay for Ib30 reactivity</title><p id="P38">To assess Ib30 reactivity in response to an agonist for the mentioned receptors, nanobit assay was used following the same protocol as discussed in the βarr2<sup>WT</sup> and βarr2<sup>DM</sup> recruitment assay(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dwivedi-Agnihotri et al., 2022</xref>). For enzyme complementation, N-terminally SmBiT fused βarr1 and N-terminally LgBiT fused Ib30 were used. For transfection, 3 μg receptor except for CXCR7 (5 μg of which is transfected), 2 μg SmBiT-βarr1, and 5 μg LgBiT-Ib30 were used. Transfected cells were stimulated with varying doses of respective ligands (mentioned in corresponding figures).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Receptor surface expression</title><p id="P39">Receptor surface expression in various assays was measured using a previously described whole cell-based surface ELISA assay<sup>34</sup>. To study the surface expression of the receptor, cells transfected with a particular receptor were seeded into a 0.01% poly-D-Lysine pre-coated 24-well plate at a density of 2x10<sup>5</sup> cells well<sup>-1</sup>. Post 24 h of seeding cells were washed once with ice-cold 1XTBS, fixed with 4% PFA (w/v in 1XTBS) on ice for 20 min, washed again three times with 1XTBS, and blocked with 1% BSA (prepared in 1XTBS) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Afterward, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-HRP antibody at 1: 5000 dilution (Sigma, Cat no. A8592) for 1.5 h, which was followed by three washes in 1% BSA. Subsequently, incubated with TMB-ELISA substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat no. 34028) until a light blue color appeared. To quench the reaction, 100 μl of the colored solution was transferred to another 96-well plate containing 100 μl of 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Afterward, the TMB substrate was removed, washed twice with 1XTBS, and incubated with 0.2% (w/v) Janus Green (Sigma; Cat no. 201677) for 15 min at room temperature. Later, cells were washed with water to remove the excess stain, followed by the addition of 800 μl of 0.5 N HCl in each well. Thereupon, the colored solution was transferred to a 96-well plate for measuring the absorbance at 595 nm. The signal intensity was normalized by calculating the ratio of A450/A595 values followed by quantifying fold increase with respect to the A450/A595 value of negative control (mock transfection) and plotted using the GraphPad Prism (v9).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS155707-supplement-Supplemental_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d99aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research in A.K.S.’s laboratory is supported by the Senior Fellowship of the DBT Wellcome Trust India Alliance (IA/S/20/1/504916) awarded to A.K.S., Science and Engineering Research Board (EMR/2017/003804, SPR/2020/000408, and IPA/2020/000405), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [37(1730)/19/EMR-II], Indian Council of Medical research (F.NO.52/15/2020/BIO/BMS), Young Scientist Award from Lady Tata Memorial Trust, and IIT Kanpur.
