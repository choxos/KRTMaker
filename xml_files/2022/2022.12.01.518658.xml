systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here, we present long-read <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of 43 diverse Y chromosomes spanning 180,000 years of human evolution, including two from deep-rooted African Y lineages, and report remarkable complexity and diversity in chromosome size and structure, in contrast with its low level of base substitution variation. The size of the Y chromosome assemblies varies extensively from 45.2 to 84.9 Mbp and include, on average, 81 kbp of novel sequence per Y chromosome. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a &gt;2-fold higher recurrence rate compared to inversions in the rest of the human genome. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions further show differing mutation rates that are sequence context-dependent and some ampliconic genes show evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, the Yq12, is composed of alternating arrays of <italic>DYZ1</italic> and <italic>DYZ2</italic> repeat units that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution of these arrays, but retain a 1:1 copy number ratio of the monomer repeats, consistent with the notion that functional or evolutionary forces are acting on this chromosomal region. Finally, our data suggests that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500 kbp distal to the currently established boundary. The availability of sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of specific traits with Y-chromosomal variants and garnering novel insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The mammalian sex chromosomes evolved from a pair of autosomes, gradually losing their ability to recombine with each other over increasing lengths, leading to degradation and accumulation of large proportions of repetitive sequences on the Y chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The resulting sequence composition of the human Y chromosome is rich in complex repetitive regions, including highly similar segmental duplications (SDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This has made the Y chromosome difficult to assemble, and, paired with reduced gene content, has led to its systematic neglect in genomic analyses.</p><p id="P3">The first human Y chromosome sequence assembly was generated almost 20 years ago, which provided a high quality but incomplete sequence (53.8% or ∼30.8/57.2 Mbp unresolved in GRCh38 Y)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Less than half (∼25 Mbp) of the GRCh38 Y chromosome is composed of euchromatin, which contains two pseudoautosomal regions, PAR1 and PAR2 (∼3.2 Mbp in total), that actively recombine with homologous regions on the X chromosome and are therefore not considered as part of the male-specific Y region (MSY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The remainder of the Y-chromosomal euchromatin (∼22 Mbp) has been divided into three main classes according to their sequence composition and evolutionary history<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>: (i) the X-degenerate regions (XDR, ∼8.6 Mbp) are remnants of the ancient autosome from which the X and Y chromosomes evolved, (ii) the X-transposed regions (XTR, ∼3.4 Mbp) resulted from a duplicative transposition event from the X chromosome followed by an inversion, and (iii) the ampliconic regions (∼9.9 Mbp) that contain sequences having up to 99.9% intra-chromosomal identity across tens or hundreds of kilobases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Besides the euchromatin, the Y contains a large proportion of repetitive and heterochromatic sequences, including the (peri-)centromeric <italic>DYZ3</italic> α-satellite and <italic>DYZ17</italic> arrays, <italic>DYZ18</italic> and <italic>DYZ19</italic> arrays, and the largest contiguous heterochromatic block in the human genome, Yq12, which is known to be highly variable in size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. All of these heterochromatic regions are thought to be composed predominantly of satellites, simple repeats, and SDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Recent attempts have been made to assemble the human Y chromosome using Illumina short-read<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, but a contiguous assembly of the ampliconic and heterochromatic regions was not achieved. In April 2022, the first complete <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of a human Y chromosome was reported by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (from individual HG002/NA24385, carrying a rare J1a-L816 Y lineage found among Ashkenazi Jews and Europeans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, termed as T2T Y). However, understanding the composition and appreciating the complexity of the Y chromosomes in the human population requires access to assemblies from many diverse individuals. Here, we combined PacBio HiFi and ONT long-read sequence data to assemble the Y chromosomes from 43 males, representing the five continental groups from the 1000 Genomes Project. While both the GRCh38 (mostly R1b-L20 haplogroup) and the T2T Y represent European Y lineages, half of our Y chromosomes constitute African lineages and include most of the deepest-rooted human Y lineages. This newly assembled dataset of 43 Y chromosomes thus provides a more comprehensive view of genetic variation, at the nucleotide level, across over 180,000 years of human Y chromosome evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sample Selection</title><p id="P5">We selected 43 genetically diverse males from the 1000 Genomes Project, representing 21 largely African haplogroups (A, B and E, including deep-rooted lineages A0b-L1038, A1a-M31 and B2b-M112)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1; Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>).

Here, we present the Y-chromosomal assemblies of 43 males from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset and a comprehensive analysis of their genetic and epigenetic variation and composition. While both the GRCh38 Y and the T2T Y assemblies represent relatively recently emerged (TMRCA 54.5 kya [95% HPD interval: 47.6 - 62.4 kya], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) European Y lineages, half of our Y chromosomes carry African Y lineages, including two of the deepest-rooted human Y lineages (A0b and A1a, TMRCA 183 kya [95% HPD interval: 160-209 kya]), which we gaplessly assembled allowing us to investigate how the Y chromosome has changed over 180,000 years of human evolution.</p><p id="P29">For the first time, we were able to comprehensively and precisely examine the extent of genetic variation down to the nucleotide level across multiple human Y chromosomes. The male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) can be roughly divided into two portions: the euchromatic and the heterochromatic regions. The single-copy protein-coding MSY genes, present in the GRCh38 Y reference sequence, are conserved in all 43 Y assemblies with few SNVs. The low SNV diversity in Y is concordant with previous studies and consistent with models of natural demographic processes such as extreme male-specific bottlenecks in recent human history and purifying selection removing deleterious mutations and linked variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The multi-copy protein-coding MSY genes are often copy number variable. We found that 5/8 multi-copy gene families showed variation in terms of copy number, with the highest variation observed in the <italic>TSPY</italic> gene family (23 to 39 copies, 46 in the T2T Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S39</xref>). Investigation of three copy-number variable gene families (<italic>TSPY</italic>, <italic>RBMY1</italic> and <italic>DAZ</italic>) revealed different modes of evolution, likely resulting from differences in structural composition of the genomic regions. For example, the majority of the <italic>TSPY</italic> genes are located within a tandemly repeated array, undergoing frequent expansions and contractions, where we also find evidence of lineage-specific acquisition and purging of pseudogenes.</p><p id="P30">The euchromatic region harbours additional structural variation across the 43 individuals. Most notably, we identified 14 inversions that together affect half of the Y-chromosomal euchromatin, with only the most closely related pair of African Ys (from NA19317 and NA19347) showing the exact same inversion composition. Of these 14 inversions, 12 showed recurrent toggling in recent human history, including five novel recurrent inversions that were not previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We narrowed down the breakpoints for all of the inversions and have refined the breakpoints down to a 500 bp region for 8 of 14 inversions. The determination of the molecular mechanism causing the inversions remains challenging; however, the increased recurrent inversion rate on the Y chromosome compared to the rest of the human genome may be in part due to DNA double-strand breaks being repaired by intra-chromatid recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The enrichment in highly similar (inverted) SDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> prone to NAHR, coupled with reduced selection to maintain gene order, may explain the high prevalence of recurrent inversions on the Y. The majority of the recurrent inversions (8/14) occur between highly similar SDs termed palindromes P1-P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Three of the palindromes appear to be evolving at faster rates compared both to the other five palindromes and the unique XDR regions of the Y, likely due to sequence exchange between multi-copy (i.e., &gt;2 copies) SDs.</p><p id="P31">In the PAR1 region, we find evidence of enrichment of indels and SVs compared to autosomes, and the rest of the X and the Y chromosomes, potentially resulting from a higher recombination rate in this region during male meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, there is a reduction of genetic variation in the proximal 500 kbp of PAR1, indicating a reduced recombination rate here and suggesting that the actual PAR1 boundary probably lies distal to the currently established boundary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">There are four heterochromatic subregions in the human Y chromosome: the (peri-)centromeric region, <italic>DYZ18</italic>, <italic>DYZ19</italic> and Yq12. Heterochromatin is usually defined by the preponderance of highly repetitive sequences and the constitutive dense packaging of the chromatin within<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. When we examined the DNA sequence and the methylation patterns for these four heterochromatic subregions, the high repetitive sequence content and the high level of methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S53, S70</xref>) observed is consistent with the definition of heterochromatin. Furthermore, resolving the complete structural variation in the heterochromatic regions of the human Y chromosome provides novel molecular archaeological evidence for evolutionary mechanisms. For example, we show how the higher order structure at the centromeric region of the Y chromosome evolved from an ancestral 36-mer HOR to a 34-mer HOR, which predominates in the centromeres of human males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, the degeneration of these repeat units of the (peri-)centromeric region of the Y chromosome has a directional bias towards the p-arm side. The presence of an <italic>Alu</italic> element right at the q-arm boundary, but not on the p-arm side, raises the possibility that following two <italic>Alu</italic> insertions, over 180,000 years ago, led to a subsequent <italic>Alu</italic>-<italic>Alu</italic> recombination that deleted the region in between and removed the diverged centromeric sequence block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In the Yq12 subregion, we find evidence for localized expansions and contractions of the <italic>DYZ1</italic> and <italic>DYZ2</italic> repeat units, though the preservation of nearly 1:1 ratio among all males studied indicates functional or evolutionary constraints.</p><p id="P33">In this study, we fully sequenced and analysed 43 diverse Y chromosomes and identified the full extent of variation of this chromosome across more than 180,000 years of human evolution, offering a major advance to our understanding of how non-recombining regions of the genome evolve and persist. For the first time, sequence-level resolution across multiple human Y chromosomes has revealed new DNA sequences and new elements of conservation, and provided molecular data that give us important insights into genomic stability and chromosomal integrity. It also offers the possibility to investigate the molecular mechanisms and evolution of repetitive sequences across a well-defined timeframe without the encumbrances of meiotic recombination. Ultimately, the ability to effectively assemble the complete human Y chromosome has been a long-awaited yet crucial milestone towards understanding the full extent of human genetic variation and also provides the starting point to associate Y-chromosomal sequences to specific human traits and more thoroughly study human evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><label>1</label><title>Sample selection</title><p id="P34">Samples were selected from the 1000 Genomes Project Diversity Panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and at least one representative was selected from each of 26 populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

First, we extracted proximal and distal inverted repeat sequences flanking the identified inversions (spacer region) and aligned them using MAFFT (v7.487)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> with default parameters. From the alignment, we only selected informative sites (i.e., not identical across all repeats and samples), excluding singletons and removing sites within repetitive or poorly aligned regions as determined by Tandem Repeat Finder (v4.09.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> and Gblocks (v0.91b)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, respectively. We inferred the ancestral state of the inverted regions following the maximum parsimony principle as follows: we counted the number of inversion events that would explain the distribution of inversions in the Y phylogeny by assuming a) that the reference (i.e., same as GRCh38 Y) state was ancestral and b) that the inverted (i.e., inverted compared to GRCh38 Y) state was ancestral. The definition of ancestral state for each of the regions was defined as the lesser number of events to explain the tree (IR3: reference; IR5: reference; P8: inverted; P7: reference; P5: reference; P4: reference; P3: reference). As we observed a clear bias of inversion state in both African (Y lineages A, B and E) and non-African Y lineages for the P6 palindrome (the African Y lineages have more inverted states (17/21) and non-African Y lineages have more reference states (17/23)), we determined the ancestral state and inversion breakpoints for African and non-African Y lineages separately in the following analyses.</p><p id="P132">We then defined an ancestral group as any samples showing an ancestral direction in the spacer region, and selected sites that have no overlapping alleles between the proximal and distal alleles in the defined ancestral group, which were defined as the final set of informative PSVs. For IR3, we used the ancestral group as samples with Y-chromosomal structure 1 (i.e., with the single ∼20.3 kbp TSPY repeat located in the proximal IR3 repeat) and ancestral direction in the spacer region. According to the allele information from the PSVs, we determined the phase (proximal or distal) for each PSV across samples. Excluding non-phased PSVs (e.g., the same alleles were found in both proximal and distal sequences), any two adjacent PSVs with the same phase were connected as a segment while masking any single PSVs with a different phase from the flanking ones to only retain reliable contiguous segments. An inversion breakpoint was determined to be a range where phase switching occurred between two segments, and the coordinate was converted to the T2T Y coordinate based on the multiple sequence alignment and to the GRCh38 Y coordinate using the LiftOver tool at the UCSC Genome Browser web page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver</ext-link>).

We then reconstructed the order of non-overlapping SDs by selecting the longest from any overlapping mappings for each SD. The P1, P2, P3, P1 yellow, and P3 teal sequences were collected from each sample only if the directionality and origin of two palindromic arms could clearly be determined in the context of inter-palindromic inversion status. For example, sample HG02486 has the GRCh38 Y segments mappings in the order of: XDR8, blue, teal, teal, blue, green, red, red, green, yellow, blue, grey, red, red, green, yellow, blue, grey, and other2 on the same contig, which matches with the expected SD order given the inversion status of HG02486 (one <italic>gr/rg</italic> inversion). As we do not know the exact breakpoint locations for the <italic>gr/rg</italic> inversion in HG02486, the green and red SDs could be mixtures of P1 and P2 origin (since both contain green and red SDs and the <italic>gr/rg</italic> inversions breakpoints are likely to be located within these regions) due to the inversion. Therefore, in order to be conservative and to avoid SDs which are potential mixes from different origins, we here excluded the green and red segments from the analysis. Similar filtering was applied to all samples in order to reduce the possibility of including variation that has been caused by e.g., inter-palindromic inversions.

The resulting consensus was then fused to the 2,413 bp consensus sequence creating a final 2,420 bp <italic>DYZ2</italic> consensus sequence. <italic>DYZ2</italic> arrays were then re-screened using HMMER (v3.3.2) and the 2,420 bp <italic>DYZ2</italic> consensus sequence.</p><p id="P166">In view of the AT-rich simple repeat portion of <italic>DYZ2</italic> being highly variable in length, only the <italic>Alu</italic> and HSATI portion of the <italic>DYZ2</italic> consensus sequence was used as part of a custom RepeatMasker library to determine the divergence of each <italic>DYZ2</italic> repeat sequence within the Yq12 subregion. Divergence was defined as the percentage of substitutions in the sequence matching region compared to the consensus. The <italic>DYZ2</italic> arrays were then visualized with a custom Turtle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html#turtle.textinput">https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html#turtle.textinput</ext-link>) script written in Python. To compare the compositional similarity between <italic>DYZ2</italic> arrays within a genome, a <italic>DYZ2</italic> array (rows) by <italic>DYZ2</italic> repeat composition profile (columns; <italic>DYZ2</italic> repeat length + orientation + divergence) matrix was constructed. Next, the SciPy (v1.8.1) library was used to calculate the Bray-Curtis Distance/Dissimilarity (as implemented in scipy.spatial.distance.braycurtis) between <italic>DYZ2</italic> array composition profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref></sup>. The complement of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used in the visualization as typically a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity closer to zero implies that the two compositions are more similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S74</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S71"><title>Yq12 <italic>DYZ1</italic> array analysis</title><p id="P167">Initially, RepeatMasker (v4.1.0) was used to annotate all repeats within <italic>DYZ1</italic> arrays. However, consecutive RepeatMasker runs resulted in variable annotations. These variable results were also observed using a custom RepeatMasker library approach with inclusion of the existing available <italic>DYZ1</italic> consensus sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In light of these findings, <italic>DYZ1</italic> array sequences were extracted with Pysam, and then each sequence underwent a virtual restriction digestion with HaeIII using the Sequence Manipulation Suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref></sup>. HaeIII, which has a ‘ggcc’ restriction cut site, was chosen based on previous research of the <italic>DYZ1</italic> repeat in monozygotic twins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref></sup>. The resulting restriction fragment sequences were oriented based on the sequence orientation of satellite sequences within them detected by RepeatMasker (base Dfam library). A new <italic>DYZ1</italic> consensus sequence was constructed by retrieving the sequence of digestion fragments 3,569 bp in length (as fragments this length were in the greatest abundance in 6 out of 7 analysed genomes), performing a MSA using Muscle (v5.1), and then applying a majority rule approach to construct the consensus sequence.</p><p id="P168">To classify the composition of all restriction fragments a k-mer profile analysis was performed. First, the relative abundance of k-mers within fragments as well as consensus sequences (<italic>DYZ18</italic>, 3.1 kbp, 2.7 kbp, <italic>DYZ1</italic>) were computed.
