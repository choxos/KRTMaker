We developed a SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen protein microarray with the nucleocapsid, spike and its domains (S1, S2), and variants with single (D614G, E484K, N501Y) or double substitutions (N501Y/Deletion69/70), allowing a more detailed high-throughput analysis of the antibody repertoire following infection. The assay was demonstrated to be reliable and comparable to ELISA. We analyzed antibodies from 18 COVID-19 patients and 12 recovered convalescent donors. S IgG level was higher than N IgG in most of the COVID-19 patients, receptor-binding domain of S1 showed high reactivity, but no antibodies were detected against heptad repeat domain 2 of S2. Furthermore, antibodies were detected against S variants with single and double substitutions in COVID-19 patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen protein microarray is a powerful tool for detailed characterization of antibody responses, with potential utility in understanding the disease progress and assessing current vaccines and therapies against evolving SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with significant global impact since it was first identified in December 2019. The immune responses of infected individuals have been studied to understand pathogenesis of asymptomatic to severe disease using serological assays, primarily ELISA. Initially, the major antigen target for these assays was nucleocapsid (N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], one of the antigenic structural proteins; later, the focus has been on the spike (S), another antigenic structural protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P3">S glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 domains; the S1 domain, which mediates binding to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the S2 domain, responsible for the fusion of host and viral cell membrane using six-helical bundle structure formed with heptad repeat (HR) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Antibodies target multiple epitopes on the S protein and yet only some of them can induce neutralizing response against SARS CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Specifically, neutralization has been shown to be proportional to the titer of antibodies that target receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4">As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, new variants are emerging with mutations that potentially affect antigenicity and pose new challenges for vaccines and therapies. These variants have multiple mutations in RBD and non-RBD subdomains including D614G, E484K, N501Y, Deletion69/70, located in S1 domain of S, and some variants confer resistance to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or to the antibodies elicited by vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. While D614G and N501Y mutations showed minimal impact on neutralization, E484K mutation reduced neutralization by the monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma (CP) therapy and post-vaccination sera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Since immunogenic epitopes are distributed across the entire S protein, more detailed characterization of antibody signatures is crucial not only to understand the disease progress, but also to evaluate CP therapy and vaccine responses for protection against infection with S variants. For this purpose, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen protein array with structural proteins N, S and its domains (S1, S2, RBD, HR2). This assay allows parallel testing for antibody responses to different targets and domains of those targets using a very small sample volume. We were able to determine the antibody signatures of multiple COVID-19 patients, as well as CP donors who recovered from COVID-19. Furthermore, we evaluated the binding of polyclonal antibodies in CP samples from individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic to S protein containing the clinically relevant substitutions D614G, E484K, N501Y and N501Y/Deletion69/70.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="P5">We generated a SARS-CoV-2 protein microarray with two most antigenic structural proteins N and S along with S domains (S1, S2), RBD subdomain of S1, HR2 subdomain of S2, S variants with single (D614G, E484K, N501Y) and double (N501Y/Deletion69/70) substitutions. After the quality of immobilized proteins were checked, the assay was validated with ELISA using eight CP donor plasma. Multiple samples were screened in parallel on a single microarray slide designed with 12-16 subarrays. We analyzed the antigen-specific IgG, IgM and IgA responses in eighteen COVID-19 patients. Eleven of these patients were also evaluated for the antibody response to S variants. In addition, four COVID-19 patients were assessed before and after the therapy along with their donors.

IgM levels were uniformly lower than IgG, which could be due to the time interval between symptom onset and the sample being taken. Although the patients 1, 6, 8 and 11 had higher levels of S-specific IgM compared to other patients, they were still less than IgG. In these samples, the differences between E484K and N501Y or N501Y/Del69/70 were higher for IgM than IgG, however the antibody levels were low.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">For detailed characterization of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, we developed a multi-antigen protein array initially with the two most immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 antigens S and N. Since antibodies target multiple epitopes on the S protein, and the antigenicity of these epitopes change due to mutagenesis in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], we extended the array to S domains and variants with single or double substitutions. S protein is heavily glycosylated, and its expression in non-mammalian systems might fail the detection of antibodies to glycosylated determinants, therefore we produced the proteins from mammalian cells for protein microarray fabrication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. We also demonstrated that protein microarrays are comparable to ELISAs, which have been used widely for serological testing during the pandemic. Both assays not only indicated that same samples are seropositive or seronegative, but also showed similarity for the sample groups with high-medium-low levels of antibodies. The difference in response seen between the protein array and the ELISA is simply because of the high, fixed concentration of immobilized protein utilized in the ELISA. This could increase sensitivity of the ELISA relative to the protein array, particularly for low affinity antibodies, but may reduce the linearity of the response when comparing antigens that are at opposite ends of the detection spectrum.</p><p id="P23">In our serum screening, all of the individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 had reactivity with full-length S protein, but binding to distinct S domains differed. Furthermore, we showed that sera from early in the pandemic contained antibodies capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 S protein containing the clinically relevant substitutions D614G, E484K, N501Y and N501Y/Deletion69/70, prevalent in clinical isolates from later in the outbreak.</p><p id="P24">In this study, our screening of COVID-19 patients showed high S-specific IgG levels compare to N-specific IgG in most of the patients as shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. We also studied the immunogenic features of specific subdomains; RBD in S1 domain and HR2 in S2 domain of S. RBD subdomain of S1 is a highly variable domain of S protein. Low ratio of S1 to RBD IgG observed in patients sera was suggesting that RBD is the antigenic determinant of S1. HR2 subdomain of S2 plays a major role in the viral fusion to the cell membrane, and is a target of fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. We did not observe any signal against HR2 in samples, even those with high levels of S2-specific antibodies. The wide range of S/RBD and S2/RBD IgG ratios in samples suggest a different distribution of dominant epitopes in S domains between individuals. Although RBD is the main antigenic region in S1 domain, most of the COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of antibody binding with non-RBD targets in S2 domain, as reported in data from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], which showed similar signature as full-length S protein between patients.</p><p id="P25">IgM and IgA antibodies were low in most of the patient samples; presence or absence may reflect differences in time of exposure to the virus and individual’s immune responses. While presence of IgM is indication of early disease, IgA is detected in more severe disease outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Target and isotype differences of serum antibodies combined with clinical features may be useful predictors of disease progress for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, immunoprofiling using multi-antigen protein arrays with only couple microliter of sera could help to detect distinct antibody characteristics of CPT donors and recipients, and monitor the disease progress post-therapy. An advantage of the protein chip for detecting antibodies is the ability to assay many samples, in this case time points, in parallel. Whilst it is clear that the patients tested showed different levels of antibodies against the antigens tested (Fig. 5), the sample size would have to be greatly expanded to detect a possible correlation with CP therapy.</p><p id="P26">Although SARS-CoV-2 protein microarrays were used for serum screening of CP in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], S variants were not included in the arrays, and S2 was not expressed in mammalian systems which could affect antigenicity due to missing PTMs. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging, reinfection cases are increasing all around the world. These variants have several mutations located in the subdomains of S protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Fig</xref>). From a few cases studied, Tillett et al. reported an asymptomatic reinfection case which was infected with two SARS-CoV-2 variants that both had single D614G substitution in S and several different mutations outside of S protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Prado-Vivar et al. reported a reinfection case with worse disease than the first infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. This individual was infected with S variant with single D614G substitution at first infection, and wild type S at second infection. These individuals were infected with variants that had also several different mutations outside of S protein. There was no data on individuals’ antibody responses to S and its domains. In our screening of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, their response was mounted against the virus they were infected with, and their antibodies bound to other variants with single mutations D614G, E484K, N501Y and double mutations N501Y/Del69/70 in S1 domain of S. This is likely due to polyclonality of antibodies in the sera/plasma, targeting a broad range of epitopes, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, specific combinations of mutations in S protein, as well as in other immunogenic viral proteins could diminish the protective immunity from previous infection and increase the probability of reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) variant, which includes E484K, D614G, N501Y and other mutations in S, exhibited a reduced neutralization by plasma from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic or vaccinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We observed some reduction in response to S with single D614G substitution in all of the samples, but only in a few samples to E484K, presumably reflects the differences between individuals’ antibody repertoire.</p><p id="P27">The strength of our study was screening each individual against multiple targets and concentrations in the same subarray with single small sample volume unlike ELISAs which requires multiple plates and sample aliquotes. Moreover, this assay could be used in a point-of-care setting to provide individuals’ full antibody signatures by targeting multiple antigens unlike most of the current point-of-care tests which targets single antigen.</p><p id="P28">Most importantly, our protein microarray, allowing parallel analysis of multiple variant proteins and their subdomains, is ideally suited for the analysis of the potential of patient antibodies to neutralize variants other than that which was responsible for the initial infection. Further, it is hoped that by extending the scope of the study and analyzing full spectrum of antibody responses, we can determine immunogenic antigens that are less prone to loss through viral evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting information</label><media xlink:href="EMS155876-supplement-Supporting_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d141aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Liise-anne Pirofski for her insightful discussions and editorial input for the manuscript.
