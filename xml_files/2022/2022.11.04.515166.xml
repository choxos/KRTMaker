By developing a customized protocol involving direct RNA nanopore sequencing here, we captured circRNAs in their native state from HIV-1 infected T cells and identified ciTRAN, a <bold>ci</bold>rcRNA modulator of HIV-1 <bold>Tran</bold>scription. We show that HIV-1 infection of monocytic, T cell lines and primary CD4+ T cells induces ciTRAN expression in a Vpr-dependent manner. ciTRAN protein interactome analysis by proximity biotinylation and mass spectrometry identified SRSF-1 as a prominent interactor of the circular RNA. SRSF-1 is known to negatively regulate HIV-1 transcription, which the virus overcomes by a yet unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that HIV-1 Vpr induced ciTRAN sequesters SRSF1 away from the viral transcriptional complex to promote efficient viral transcription. Accordingly, ciTRAN depletion by CRISPR-Cas phenocopied the effects of SRSF1 overexpression and improved SRSF1 association with HIV-1 transcriptional complex. Finally, we show that an SRSF-1-inspired competing peptide can inhibit HIV-1 transcription regardless of ciTRAN induction. The hijacking of a host circRNA thus represents a new facet of primate lentiviruses in overcoming transmission bottlenecks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV transcription</kwd><kwd>direct RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>circular RNA</kwd><kwd>Vpr</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>HIV-1 inhibition</kwd><kwd>HIV transcriptional Silencing</kwd><kwd>circDR-seq</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in immune cells, and many of them are regulated during immunological signaling, inflammation, and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, only a few circRNAs are known to exert regulatory influences in the context of immune function and viral infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Notably, the role of circRNAs in various stages of HIV-1 life cycle remains elusive.</p><p id="P3">CircRNAs are formed by back-splicing events that occur in both coding and non-coding linear transcripts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).

Moreover, PCR bias can lead to more efficient amplification of some circRNAs, additional events such as trans-splicing and exon repetitions further hamper identification of circRNA in the native form(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).

We sequentially removed non-circRNAs by iterative depletion of the linear RNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Accordingly, total RNA from mock and HIV-1 GFP infected Jurkat E6.1 T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>) was first subjected to probe-based degradation by RNase H (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), which led to more than 95% reduction of 18S and 5S rRNA species without impacting the representative circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The remainder linear pool from the ribo-depleted fractions was first polyadenylated using <italic>E. coli</italic> polyA polymerase and subsequently removed using oligo-dT coated magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>), leading to the depletion of more than 94% and 97% of the abundant linear RNAs from the mock and infected RNA pool, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The efficiency of RNase R is also limited by the presence of structural RNAs and the availability of diverse substrates, including snRNAs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Compared to the RNaseR treatment-based approach, our method (circDRseq) enabled the efficient depletion of G-quadruplexes-containing RNAs (G4-RNA) as well as the small RNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) while resulting in a 50-86-fold enrichment of representative circRNAs species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Detection of circRNAs in the native forms</title><p id="P7">Since circRNAs lack free ends and polyA tail, we first linearised the enriched circRNAs by controlled fragmentation using NEBNext Magnesium RNA fragmentation module (details in the supplementary information). The linear fragments were then polyadenylated to allow direct RNA sequencing for the detection of BSJs by nanopore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The addition of poly-A tail to the fragmented circular RNA species from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> was confirmed by amplification from cDNA templates generated by oligo-dT priming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). Next, we generated the library from three replicates, and the tabulated data represents the output from three independent runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The representative yeast reads are from an internal standard comprising yeast enolase RNA added in Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing kits. We used NanoPack (a package to visualize and analyze long-read sequencing) to analyze raw data generated from mock and infected samples. The analysis revealed a comparable read length, cumulative yield, basecall quality over time, and average read quality over read length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A-H</xref>) (details in supplementary information). The next step was to detect BSJs from the sequencing reads obtained. For this, we first extracted circRNAs FASTA sequences from circBase and circAtlas and joined the ends of these sequences (according to the pipeline described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) to obtain the BSJ sequences. Considering the high precision, recall, and F1 score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3A</xref>), we selected a 100 bp library for pblat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary information</xref>). Using these stringency conditions, we detected 451 and 481 circRNAs with an overlap of 278 circRNAs in the mock-treated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In infected cells with an overlap of 41 circRNA, 76 and 107 circRNA were detected, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We further expanded our analysis beyond the public databases to identify unannotated circRNAs from our DRS data by generating a virtual exonic library. Interestingly, out of 458 and 86 circRNAs, 151 in mock and 39 in infection were unannotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). The number of circRNAs was comparatively less in HIV-1 infection, which could result from RNaseL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). We also confirmed two unannotated circRNAs by Sanger sequencing to verify the presence of novel BSJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3C and S3D</xref>) in our data sets. We found more than 80% of the circRNAs originating from protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3E and S3F</xref>). Comparison of the size distribution and strandedness (Positive or negative DNA strand) corroborated with circBase, eliminating any size and strand-based bias in detection by circDRseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3G-K</xref>).</p><p id="P8">One of the advantages of direct RNA sequencing by nanopore is that it enables simultaneous detection of m6A modification. RNA m6A modification regulates key functions like controlling RNA splicing, translation, stability, and translocation. Considering circDR-seq can allow simultaneous detection of RNA-associated modifications, we assessed the possibility of detecting m6A containing circRNAs, and their possible coding potential by detecting the presence of m6A and internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Through an integrative analysis (by tools like Nanom6A, CPC2 and IRES finder), we obtained high- confidence protein-coding circRNA candidates. Nanom6A revealed 120 and 21 m6A containing sites that comprised 28 and 7 circRNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A,B</xref>). Further, randomly selected m6A circRNA candidates were also validated for the presence of the modifications using an N6-Methyladenosine Enrichment Kit (NEB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C,D</xref>) that detected the m6A presence on the circRNAs. However, we did not find infection-specific m6A modifications for the candidates tested. Nevertheless, these experiments highlighted the potential of circDRseq for concurrently detecting circRNA modifications. Further, CPC2 and IRES analysis showed an overlap of 98 and 16 circRNAs in mock and infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4E and S4F</xref>). Altogether four overlapping circRNAs in mock were detected, which plausibly have the coding potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4G</xref>). Finally, the robustness in detecting circRNAs was assessed by comparing circDR-seq with the CIRI-long and circNICK-LRS (recently published pipelines) that showed 99.93 and 82.20% efficiency in detection, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4H-K</xref>). Altogether, using circDR-seq, 1017 circRNAs (831 in mock and 186 in infection) candidates were detected in their native forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), and the possibility of simultaneously capturing RNA modifications was also demonstrated.</p><p id="P9">Despite low representation, circDRseq enabled the detection of circRNAs from HIV-1-infected T cells in their native states. The next step was to interrogate the functions associated with these RNA species in HIV-1 infection. Out of 41 candidates that were shortlisted based on their common presence in the databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), five were common to the uninfected pool. The remaining 36, referred to as infection-specific, were selected for further validation. We found a reliable PCR amplification of the desired size for 31 circRNAs. Out of these 31, the expression levels of 10 circRNAs were more than 1.5-fold in the case of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). We hypothesized that these upregulated circRNAs could have a role during HIV-1 infection. To find out, we designed Cas13d (CasRx) targeting gRNAs against the BSJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>) for these select candidates (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) and performed a CRISPR/CasRx-based (CasRx or Cas13D is an ssRNA targeting nuclease) knockdown in Jurkat Tag (JTAg) cells. The cells depleted of indicated circRNAs were selected on puromycin, expanded, and knockdown for individual circRNA was confirmed subsequently using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>; circRNA-specific primers tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, the HIV-1 infection in circRNA-depleted target cells by luciferase-encoding HIV-1 (HIV-Luc) revealed that ciTRAN (55%) and, to a lesser extent (37.5%) circB4GALT6 reduced the luciferase expression from the virus scored as a function of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). We chose to examine the impact of ciTRAN expression on HIV-1 lifecycle because of its ability to reduce infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ciTRAN relieves a post-integration block to viral gene expression</title><p id="P10">To investigate the step of the virus life cycle impacted by ciTRAN, the target cells that either expressed a non-relevant gRNA (Luciferase gRNA) or ciTRAN-specific gRNA were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). The subcellular fractions from the HIV-1 GFP infected cells were used to capture reverse transcription products, integration events, and proviral transcription. In conditions where ciTRAN, but not the linear counterpart, was depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>), our experiments suggested that depletion of ciTRAN did not impact reverse transcription from the viral genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), nor was the copy number of the integrated provirus changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the contrary, cytoplasmic viral RNA was reduced, and nuclear run-on assay indicated a 2.3-fold reduction in transcription of HIV-1 RNA in ciTRAN depleted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>). The fewer transcripts consequentially reduced intracellular viral capsid as revealed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), pointing to an effect of ciTRAN at a post-integration step.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ciTRAN binds to a negative regulator of HIV transcription</title><p id="P11">CircRNAs can regulate parental gene expression since they can interface with DNA or RNA at the sequence level and establish specific interactions with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Furthermore, circRNAs can also directly establish interactions with chromatin or regulate parental gene expression by binding to protein mediators of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). ciTRAN is encoded by <italic>SMARCA5</italic>, and the circular RNA species is predominantly nuclear-localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Our experiments indicated that ciTRAN depletion negatively impacts transcription from the provirus, so we wondered if ciTRAN targets a host factor to modulate such events. To address this, we employed the CARPID (CRISPR-assisted RNA–protein interaction detection method) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) for isolating the ciTRAN-interacting proteins. Specific guides were generated that installed a catalytically dead CasRx fused with biotin ligase on the BSJ of ciTRAN. This is followed by a pulse labeling of biotin and subsequent enrichment of the biotinylated pool by streptavidin affinity matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>). Isolation of differentially enriched bands and identity by mass-spectrometry revealed SRSF1 as a top candidate interactor of ciTRAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) from the lysates of infected T cells, reciprocally, showed 6-fold enrichment of ciTRAN with SRSF1-specific antibody over IgG control, further confirming the specificity of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We used HIV-1 Tat, an RNA-binding protein, as non-relevant control that did not co-enrich ciTRAN. This experiment also ruled out the possibility of ciTRAN sequestering Tat and concurrent modulation of the viral transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We, therefore, next examined whether the effect of ciTRAN depletion on HIV-1 gene expression resulted from the loss of interactions between the circRNA and SRSF1. JTAg ectopically expressing haemagglutinin (HA) tagged SRSF1 phenocopied the effects of ciTRAN downregulation by reducing the viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F</xref>). Moreover, SRSF1 expression in the produer cells (JTAg) also reduced the number of progeny virions produced and as a consequence less number of target cells (TZM-GFP) were infected, suggesting an impact on the biogenesis and onward transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Further, regulating the ciTRAN and SRSF1 levels in non-T cells (HEK293T) cells during virus production also influenced the number of infection events produced by the progeny virions, suggesting that the phenotype is not cell type-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ciTRAN obstructs LTR accessibility of SRSF1 to promote infectivity</title><p id="P12">To obtain detailed insights into the ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis and its contribution to the formation of the functional transcriptional complex on HIV-1 promoter, we examined SRSF1, RNAPII, and Tat occupancy on HIV-1 promoter (TAR (trans-activating region) locus) by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP experiments indicated a strong interaction of SRSF1 with the TAR locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5H</xref>). Strikingly, this association of SRSF1 with the TAR locus was diminished by overexpression of ciTRAN from a synthetic construct, and the ectopic expression of SRSF-HA restored it to 70%, suggesting a competing scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also checked the association of RNAPII on the HIV-1 promoter in these identical conditions and found that increased SRSF1 association excludes Pol-II from the viral promoter and that ciTRAN restores the polymerase association for effective transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5I</xref>). SRSF1 is a constitutively expressed protein that competes with and replaces HIV-1 Tat from the transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In agreement, the reduced signal for Tat ChIP was suggestive of Tat displacement by SRSF1 from the transcribing locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5J</xref>). Altogether these experiments indicated that ciTRAN competes for SRSF1 sequestration to reinstate Tat interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RRM2-inspired peptides can prevent ciTRAN action</title><p id="P13">SRSF1 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a carboxy-terminal rich in arginine/serine-rich (RS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We next examined the molecular features of SRSF1 required for ciTRAN interaction and the consequential effects on viral transcription in the absence of those. Employing a series of deletion clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5G and S5K</xref>), using PAR-CLIP, we found that when RRM2 was deleted, there was no enrichment of ciTRAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The loss of ciTRAN interaction in ΔRRM2 mutant is also consistent with its ability to promote viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we sought to explore SRSF1protein domains as viral gene expression inhibitors in the context of ciTRAN expression. Accordingly, we generated a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) tagged RRM2 and showed that it can inhibit virus gene expression, suggesting the possibility of therapeutically targeting the ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Collectively, these experiments provided molecular determinants of SRSF1 required for ciTRAN recognition, mechanistic insights into the ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis, and therapeutic targeting possibility.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>HIV-1 Vpr induces ciTRAN expression</title><p id="P15">Having established the ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis in HIV-1 transcriptional regulation and its virological effects, we next investigated the viral side of the equation in regulating the phenotype. Expression of ciTRAN was observed in natural infections (n=15) ranging from 4-13-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, when PBMCs and purified primary CD4+ cells isolated from healthy donors were infected with HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6A, S6B,S6C</xref>), we observed up to 10-fold induction of ciTRAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B and 6C</xref>). The ciTRAN upregulation was only limited to HIV-1, and MLV could not induce it, as revealed by ectopic expression of HIV-1and MLV constructs in JTAg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results implied the relevance of ciTRAN expression in HIV-1 infected primary cells and cell lines and provoked us to surmise the involvement of virally encoded proteins in stimulating the ciTRAN expression. To find out, we assessed ciTRAN levels by transfecting the virus genomes that could not produce indicated viral accessory/regulatory proteins and enzymes. ciTRAN levels were unchanged in almost all conditions except when the virus lacked Vpr; the ciTRAN levels were equivalent to the empty vector-transfected pool when the virus lacked Vpr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Further, the infection of primary CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with Vpr +/- HIV-1 Luc viruses confirmed the involvement of Vpr accessory protein in the induction of ciTRAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F, 6G and 6H</xref>). We next investigated whether Vpr requires help from other viral proteins to effect ciTRAN induction. Representative alleles expressed from pCDNA 3.1(-) from NL4-3, transmitted founder viruses CH040 and REJO indicated that it is a conserved feature associated with HIV-1 encoded Vpr. In contrast, Vpx cannot induce ciTRAN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Vpr sufficient HIV-1 is associated with higher virion infectivity in T cells compared to HIV-1 deficient in Vpr. We show that ciTRAN contributes to this infectivity enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6D</xref>. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), we found that HIV-1 Vpr enhances the viral replication in human macrophages via various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Further, virion-encapsidated Vpr also has been implicated in the infection of macrophages. Therefore, we next asked if virion-packaged Vpr is competent to increase cellular levels of ciTRAN. THP-1 monocytes challenged with HIV-1 Luc showed more than 10-fold induction of ciTRAN, and that virion-encapsidated Vpr (during the production, Vpr is packaged through expression <italic>in trans</italic> using pEGFP-C2) was sufficient to induce the circRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D and 7E</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that HIV-1 Vpr is required and sufficient to induce the expression of ciTRAN in monocytes and T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis is functionally conserved</title><p id="P16">Identification of a well-preserved SRSF1 binding site on LTR from various HIV-1 isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>) reinforces the conservation of ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis in regulating the viral transcription. We, therefore, experimentally checked if ciTRAN regulates LTR transcription for transmitted founder viruses (TFV) in addition to LTRs from other clades. To experimentally assess ciTRANs activity on LTR-driven expression, we generated PGL3-Luc-based minigene LTR reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6F</xref>) and performed luciferase assays in HEK293T cells by co-transfecting LTR minigenes along with Cas13Rx and gRNA against ciTRAN or non-targeting gRNA. To confirm the effect of ciTRAN depletion on reporter expression. In conditions where ciTRAN was depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6G</xref>), the concomitant reduction in luciferase expression from viral LTR was observed regardless of the origin of the LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Additionally, the SRSF1 ectopic expression (pCDNA 3.1(-) SRSF-1 HA ectopic expression in target cells) markedly reduced luciferase expression. However, ciTRAN expression from synthetic construct (pCDNA 3.1(+) circMini ciTRAN) rescued this transcriptional defect for all the LTRs in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), signifying a conserved ciTRAN-SRSF1 axis in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription.</p><p id="P17">SRSF1 expression remained unaltered in the infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6H</xref>), indicating that a constitutively expressed protein critical for cell survival is a bottleneck for HIV-1 transmission.

By substantially reducing the linear RNA content, we demonstrated that direct RNA sequencing could be used for detecting circRNA BSJs, thus expanding the utility of ONT for not only capturing circRNAs in the native form but also associated modifications. Moreover, although ONT DRS sequencing results in low-read numbers (1-2 million reads/flow cell) compared to hundreds of millions of reads that can be obtained using cDNA-based Illumina platforms, we showed that enrichment using successive linear RNA removal steps could, to a great extent, circumvent the need to obtain a higher number of reads without compromising the data quality. A multistep purification procedure and BSJ detection method might introduce a bias in the circRNAs that are being identified. Therefore, we performed a systematic and extensive validation of circDR-seq: using different databases, simulated datasets, and comparative assessment with recently published protocols (CIRI-long and circNICK-LRS), size distribution, experimental and functional validation, which exemplify the reliability of our approach in detecting bonafide circRNAs. Further, circDR-seq enabled the detection of circRNAs of sizes ranging from as small as 100 bases to more than 5000 bases, which is currently considered a limitation by cDNA-based circRNA nanopore sequencing approaches (Rahimi, 2021, Zhang, 2021). Further, our identification of unannotated BSJs in the native form and further validation by Sanger sequencing exemplify the utility of circDRseq in cataloging novel circRNAs. circDR-seq can potentially be extended to capturing circRNAs of various sizes and understanding their contributions to other pathophysiologies.</p><p id="P19">HIV-1 infection-associated circRNAs were reliably captured, and we further demonstrated a functional role for a circRNA ciTRAN in intersecting a molecular pathway involved in HIV-1 transcription regulation. For this, complementary approaches involving cell lines, primary cells, conventional RNA interference, and contemporary RNA manipulating tools were employed, ensuring that the phenotype is not affected by the cognate linear RNA, cell types, or a method of perturbation. We acknowledge that the extent of circRNA depletion by CRISPR was only up to 50% for some circRNAs, and this we purview as a limitation because other than BSJs, we cannot specify the regions for gRNA targeting without impacting the linear counterparts. Thus, methods that achieve higher knockdown efficiency may reveal additional candidate circRNAs and their relevance for infection.</p><p id="P20">SRSF1 and HIV-1 Tat compete for binding onto an overlapping sequence in the TAR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We demonstrated that RRM2 is required and alone is as effective as full-length protein in obstructing Tat binding with TAR. SRSF1, which is constitutively expressed, can out-compete Tat binding in the early phase of viral transcription due to the low level of Tat, thus directly affecting HIV-1 trans-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We show that ciTRAN intercepts SRSF1’s ability to displace Tat from the transcriptional complex by sequestering it away, enabling efficient viral transcription. Remarkably, the binding of ciTRAN to SRSF1 is also RRM2-dependent, and correspondingly, SRSF1 lacking RRM2 enhances the HIV-1 infectivity. Therefore, it would be interesting to define the propensity of RRM2 towards ciTRAN binding by structural studies. Furthermore, we show the feasibility of targeting the RRM2-ciTRAN axis by generating a synthetic CPP-tagged RRM2-mimic which we showed antagonizes virion-induced ciTRAN. Future studies can refine this approach by developing small molecule mimics or peptides for inhibiting HIV-1 transcription, an event crucial for virion biogenesis and propagation.</p><p id="P21">HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr is crucial in the early stage of the viral life cycle in myeloid and lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).

Our experimental demonstration that HIV-1 lacking Vpr fails to induce ciTRAN, and virion encapsidated Vpr is sufficient to induce ciTRAN for relieving the SRSF1-mediated transcriptional block provides mechanistic insights into this long-sought Vpr function. Our results are also consistent with encapsidated Vpr's ability to modulate HIV-1 replication in the early stage of infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Like other auxiliary proteins, Vpr is known to be conserved within different HIV-1 clades. Upon investigation, we found that different Vprs, but not HIV-2 Vpx, can induce the ciTRAN, suggesting a conserved function of this accessory protein. However, how Vpr augments ciTRAN is yet unclear and requires further investigations. Vpr mutational studies could be one way to understand ciTRAN induction and associated enhanced viral transcription.</p><p id="P22">In sum, hijacking of a host circRNA to avoid RBP-mediated transcriptional silencing offers new insights into the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 and offers new possibilities for therapeutic targeting.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P23">Jurkat E6.1 (ATCC), THP-1 (ATCC) and Jurkat Tag (JTAg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) cell lines were cultured in RPMI (Biowest) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Certified, heat-inactivated serum from Gibco; Cat.

The nuclei were collected and resuspended in a sonication buffer containing 10 mM Tri-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% EGTA, 0.1 % Sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5 percent N-lauryl sarcosine, as well as protease inhibitors.</p><p id="P41">DNA was sonicated using a probe sonicator for 15 cycles of 30 seconds and 45 seconds off to obtain an average fragment length of 300–700 bp. Samples were centrifuged at 16000xg for 10 minutes at 4 °C after being treated with 1% Triton X-100. During each ChIP cycle, an aliquot of sonicated DNA was reverse-crosslinked and run on a 1% agarose gel to confirm fragment size.</p><p id="P42">Chromatin (25 μg) from different samples was immunoprecipitated by adding the antibody of interest (anti-SRSF1, anti-RNAPII and anti-Tat), followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, 30 μl of Protein G beads (Invitrogen) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed sequentially for 3 min each in low salt (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), high salt (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% Sodium deoxycholate) and TE buffer. Beads were eluted in 150 μl elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mM NaHCO3) and treated with 1 μl RNaseA (1mg ml<sup>-1</sup> Ambion) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was reversed, and proteins were degraded by adding 1 μl proteinase K and incubation at 65°C for 4 h. Eluted DNA was purified and used for qPCR analysis. For ChIP experiment, four different conditions were used. TAR enrichment for SRSF1, RNAPII and HIV-1 Tat ChIP was checked in non-targetting gRNA expressing JTAg cells (gRFP, termed as vector), ciTRAN knockdown cells (gciTRAN), ectopic expression of SRSF-1 highlighted with underline (pCDNA3.1(-)) along with pCDNA 3.1(+) circMini empty vector and pCDNA 3.1(+) circMini ciTRAN. Data was represented as fold change for TAR enrichment normalized with IgG background.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Virion incorporation of Vpr</title><p id="P43">Virus incorporation assay was done as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Virus particles (HIV-1 Luc) were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate transfection reagent in a 10<sup>cm2</sup> plate, NL4-3 Env- R- Luc, pMD2.G (VSVG) along with 2μg Vpr expressing construct (pEGFP-C2-Vpr) or vector alone. After 12-15 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with 2% FBS containing DMEM. After 48h, the virus-containing supernatant was collected at 500 x g for 5 min to exclude any cell debris. Next, the virus-containing supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Whatman). The suspension was overlaid on a 20% sucrose ( prepared in 1 x PBS) cushion and concentrated at ~110,000 x g for 2h at 4°C using a Beckman-Coulter ultracentrifuge. After the spin, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was either suspended in 1xPBS for infectivity experiment or in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) for western blot.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>SRSF1 deletion mutants</title><p id="P44">SRSF-1 full-length gene was cloned in pCDNA 3.1(-)HA vector using XbaI and BspEI after PCR amplification from cDNA using specific primers. Different mutants of SRSF-1 such as RRM1, RRM2, and RS, were then generated on this backbone, keeping HA in the frame using PCR mutagenesis (primers are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table S1</xref>). Cloning was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the expression of each construct was confirmed using anti-HA immunoblotting. Further, the CPP-tagged SRSF1 RRM2 mimic was cloned in house. The RRM2 domain was cloned into an SP-CPP sequence containing plasmid which was previously generated in the lab. The CPP sequence used is GAYARKAARQARAGVD. The CPP-tagged RRM2 has CMV promoter and HA tag at the C-terminus facilitating its purification using anti-HA antibody-based pull-down in mammalian cell culture supernatant. Since the CPP-RRM2 plasmid generated in this study contains a CMV promoter for mammalian expression therefore the experiment was performed in transfection format by cotransfecting SP-CPP or SP-CPP-RRM2-HA along with HIV-1 Tat and PGL3-LTR-Luc constructs. Luciferase readings as a function of LTR activity was analyzed to confirm the functionality of the construct.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>PBMC isolation from peripheral blood</title><p id="P45">Blood was collected in preservative-free anticoagulant (0.2 % Final concentration of EDTA) from three donors and processed immediately for PBMC isolation. PBMC isolation was done with the help of Histopaque using the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma Aldrich Cat No. 10771). Precisely, 3 ML anticoagulated blood was layered on the top of an equal amount of Histopaque-1077. Afterward, the sample was carefully centrifuged in a swing bucket rotor keeping acceleration and brake at the lowest setting at 400x g for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following centrifugation, cells from the opaque interface were transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube. Cells were washed twice with isotonic phosphate buffer saline collected upon centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 minutes. Finally, cells were re-suspended in the isotonic phosphate buffer saline or RPMI 1640 (BIOWEST) and processed further for the CD4+ cell isolation.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>CD4<sup>+</sup> cell purification</title><p id="P46">CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified by positive selection using magnetic separation with a CD4<sup>+</sup> isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using PBMCs from three donors as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
