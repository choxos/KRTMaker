Amongst human tendons, the hamstrings are the least likely to be injured or degenerate, providing a prototypic healthy tendon reference. The aim of this study was to define the transcriptome and location of all cell types in healthy hamstring tendon. We profiled the transcriptomes of 10,533 nuclei from 4 healthy donors using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified 12 distinct cell types. We confirmed the presence of two fibroblast cell types, endothelial cells, mural cells, and immune cells, and revealed the presence of cell types previously unreported for tendon sites, including different skeletal muscle cell types, satellite cells, adipocytes, and nerve cells, which are undefined nervous system cells. Location of these cell types within tendon was defined using spatial transcriptomics and imaging, and transcriptional networks and cell-cell interactions were identified. We demonstrate that fibroblasts have a high number of potential cell-cell interactions, are present throughout the whole tendon tissue, and play an important role in the production and organisation of extracellular matrix, thus confirming their role as key regulators of hamstring tendon tissue homeostasis. Overall, our findings highlight the highly complex cellular networks underpinning tendon function and underpins the importance of fibroblasts as key regulators of hamstring tendon tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>single nucleus transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>hamstring</kwd><kwd>fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Tendons are fibrous connective tissues that seamlessly connect muscles to bone. The fibrous composition of the tendons allows them to withstand large mechanical loads, and store and deliver substantial forces that facilitate joint movement and stability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Despite their important role in musculoskeletal function, there is still a lack of understanding of the underlying biology of tendon; even the cellular composition and prominent markers remain poorly understood compared to neighbouring musculoskeletal tissues. Consequently, treatment of tendon disease pathology such as tendinopathy is limited to exercise programmes, pain management, and surgical intervention, but largely fails to address disease pathology or allow focussed drug development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The tendon extracellular matrix (ECM) is mainly made up of type I collagen, type III collagen and proteoglycans, including decorin, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, fibromodulin, and biglycan, among others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. ECM components are produced and maintained by fibroblast-like cells, also called tenocytes. These elongated fibroblasts are located inside collagen fibres and in the surrounding endotenon, the loose connective tissue which surrounds collagen bundles in tendons. The endotenon contains a more heterogeneous mix of vascular, nerve, and mesenchymal cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of both innate immune cells, such as macrophages, and adaptive immune cell types, such as T cells, have been reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. These studies demonstrate a diverse cellular environment, yet these cell types and their interactions have not been comprehensively characterised. Insight into the cellular composition of healthy tendon is vital to unravel pathways and relationships dysregulated in disease, enabling the identification of new pharmaceutical targets and better design of biomaterials. Currently, progress in the field of tendon biology is hindered by accessibility of healthy comparative tissue and the technical challenges posed by ECM-rich tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are increasingly used to characterise major and rare cell populations within tissues and infer important cellular markers and potential cellular interactions. Initial studies by Kendal <italic>et al</italic>. (2020) and Akbar <italic>et al</italic>. (2021) presented CITE-seq and scRNA-seq results of healthy and diseased tendons. Despite the limited number of cells captured in these studies, ~440 cells and 3,040 cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], identification of fibroblasts/stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells was possible. However, the low cell numbers captured limited a detailed cellular profiling of healthy tendon. Therefore, a more comprehensive and spatially resolved dataset is needed to infer the cellular states, functions, and interactions that underlie hamstring tendon health. The aim of this study was to create a comprehensive single-cell healthy hamstring reference dataset using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), and resolve cellular locations using spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence imaging.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics</title><p id="P7">Ethical approval was granted for the Oxford Musculoskeletal Biobank (19/SC/0134) by the local research ethics committee (Oxford Research Ethics Committee B) for all work on human hamstring tendon, and informed written consent was obtained from all patients according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Tissue acquisition and processing</title><p id="P8">Healthy hamstring tissue (semitendinosus; proximal one-third which includes the midbody to the myotendinous junction) was collected from patients undergoing ACL reconstruction for an ACL rupture, in which healthy hamstring is used as a graft tissue.

After pouring off the supernatant, the tubes were briefly spun down to get all the liquid to the bottom.

We identified 317 regulons with significantly enriched motifs, and the resulting binary regulon activity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) clearly stratifies similar cell types identified by clustering the integrated snRNA-seq data. The three skeletal muscle cell clusters, located on the left side of the matrix, have the most distinct regulon activity when compared to all the other clusters. Interestingly, satellite cells, multipotent cells present in skeletal muscle, did not cluster with the skeletal muscle cells. Both of the fibroblast cell types had distinct sets of activated regulons. Cell clustering based on regulon activity reflected the findings from the regulon activity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). All cell subsets, apart from the small nerve cells cluster, could easily be detected as a separate cluster. The three skeletal muscle cell types, especially the slow-twitch and fast-twitch skeletal muscle cell subsets, showed a lot of overlapping regulon activity but were different from non-skeletal muscle cells. Satellite cells clustered close to the fibroblast subsets rather than close to the skeletal muscle cell subsets. Although the two fibroblasts cell clusters were present near each other, they were clearly distinct. Finally, the regulon specificity score (RSS) was calculated to assess regulon-cell type cluster specificity, and the top 5 regulons per cell type were highlighted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Two distinct fibroblast cell types are detected in healthy hamstring tendon</title><p id="P27">In order to better understand the similarities and differences between the MKX+ and PDGFRA+ fibroblasts, we compared their gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Markers previously described as specific for tendon fibroblasts, including mohawk <italic>(MKX)</italic>, tenomodulin <italic>(TNMD)</italic>, thrombospondin-4 <italic>(THBS4)</italic>, and cartilage oligometric matrix protein <italic>(COMP)</italic>, were all exclusively present in MKX+ fibroblasts. Other highly expressed genes included piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 <italic>(PIEZO2)</italic>, which is important for proprioception, and different collagens and ECM proteins <italic>(COL11A1, COL11A2, COL12A1, COL14A1, FMOD)</italic>. In contrast, PDGFRA+ fibroblasts specifically express high levels of neuronal growth regulator 1 <italic>(NEGR1)</italic>, RNA-binding protein Nova-1 <italic>(NOVA1)</italic>, and vitrin, as well as fibrillin-1 <italic>(FBN1)</italic>, fibulins <italic>(FBLN1, FBLN2, FBLN5)</italic>, and elastin <italic>(ELN)</italic>, which are all key components of elastic fibres. Differences between these two fibroblasts subsets are further illustrated by the differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Pathway analysis using highly expressed genes for each fibroblast subset revealed that both cell types had strong upregulation of “ECM organisation”, “collagen formation”, “collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes”, and “ECM proteoglycans”. However, increased expression of “elastin fibre formation” and “molecules associated with elastic fibres” were only found in PDGFRA+ fibroblasts, while “signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases”,” signalling by MET”, “MET promotes cell motility”, and “MET activates PTK2 signalling” were only significant in MKX+ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of healthy human hamstring tendon showed that these tendon fibroblasts, recognisable by their typical elongated shape, are positive for fibroblast marker lubricin (PRG4), while only a subset of fibroblasts showed expression of PDGFRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We performed cell2location analysis to leverage the cell type annotations identified in the snRNA-seq data and decompose the cell type spatial location of each cluster. We found that both fibroblast cell types, but in this tissue mainly MKX+ fibroblasts, are predicted to be located throughout the whole hamstring, while the PDGFRA+ fibroblasts were predicted to be especially abundant in areas close to skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although tendon fibroblasts are thought to be mainly responsible for the production and organisation of ECM in tendon, not only fibroblasts, but other cell types such as satellite cells, mural cells, adipocytes, and nerve-like cells were also found to be potential producers of type I and type III collagens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Pathway analysis confirmed that while both fibroblast subsets had a high enrichment score for ECM-related GO:BP terms, other cells, including satellite cells, vascular and lymphatic endothelium, mural cells, and nerve-like cell, are also involved in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Three types of skeletal muscle-like cells are present in human hamstring tendon</title><p id="P28">Human tendons are highly transitional tissues that transition from bone attachment (enthesis) through tendon midbody to the muscle attachment (myotendinous junction, MTJ). The tissue used in this study includes the region of hamstring tendon from the midbody to the MTJ. Although macroscopic muscle at the MTJ was removed from tendon samples during tissue processing for sequencing, tendon regions are a continuum and it is unsurprising that skeletal muscle was present in this area. Three cell types were identified with high expression of the skeletal muscle markers triadin <italic>(TRDN)</italic> and desmin (<italic>DES</italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Two of the three clusters expressed high levels of troponins: while one cluster expressed high levels troponin isoforms associated with fast-twitch skeletal muscle <italic>(TNNT3, TNNC2</italic>, and <italic>TNNI2)</italic>, the other cluster expressed high levels of isoforms associated with slow-twitch skeletal muscle <italic>(TNNT1, TNNI1</italic>, and <italic>TNNC1)</italic>. The third cell type was not associated with high expression of troponin isoforms, but instead expressed high levels of <italic>COL22A1</italic>, a transcript for an ECM protein which is mainly located in tissue junctions. Therefore, these cells were designated “transitional skeletal muscle cells”. Trichrome staining clearly shows the presence of skeletal muscle (red) infiltrating the collagen dense matrix of tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence confirms the presence of both triadin (TRDN) and troponin T1 (TNNT1) in healthy hamstring tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Visually, all three skeletal muscle cell types are predicted to be located simultaneously within one region (as highlighted). In addition, each skeletal muscle cell type is also located throughout some other parts of the tissue section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Pathway analysis revealed that both fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle cells were associated with “muscle contraction”, “striated muscle contraction”, and “ion homeostasis”, while no Reactome pathways were significantly enriched in the transitional skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). As all three of these cell types only have a limited number of potential ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), it is more likely that their interactions are mechanical interactions rather than molecular in hamstring tendon MTJ.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>The vascular compartment of hamstring tendon is composed of three distinct populations</title><p id="P29">The vascular compartment includes 3 distinct populations: vascular endothelium <italic>(FLT1, CD34, NOTCH4)</italic>, lymphatic endothelial <italic>(MMRN1, PROX1, KDR, FLT4)</italic>, and mural cells <italic>(NOTCH3, PDGFRB, MYO1B)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cell2location analysis demonstrates a large overlap in the predicted locations of vascular endothelial cells (black), mural cells (blue), and lymphatic endothelium (orange), suggesting possible interactions between these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunofluorescence confirms the presence of vessels across healthy hamstring tendon tissue. However, vessels seem to be much more abundant in areas close to muscle fibres than in the main body of the tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). GO:BP pathways associated with vascular processes, including cell migration, cell communication, signalling, blood vessel development, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, and cell motility, were all strongly enriched in vascular endothelium. Strong enrichment of most of these pathways was also found in all other cell types, except for skeletal muscle cells and satellite cells, which only showed minimal enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Enriched pathways from the Reactome database were “signal transduction” and “signalling by Rho GTPases” for vascular endothelium, “signal transduction” and “signalling by GPCR” in mural cells, and “RHOG GTPase cycle” in lymphatic endothelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). The predicted ligand-receptor interactions show a high number of predicted interactions between the three vascular cell types and the two fibroblast cell types, especially between mural cells and MKX+ fibroblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Among the top predicted ligand-receptor interactions from mural cells to MKX+ fibroblast are pairs involved in the GO:BP pathways signal transduction (COPA &amp; EGFR), angiogenesis (FGF1 &amp; TGFBR3) and BMP signalling (BMP5 &amp; multiple receptor complexes). Among the top predicted ligand-receptor interactions from MKX+ fibroblasts to mural cells are immune response / cell adhesion (THBS1 &amp; CD36), FGF2 &amp; CD44 which are involved in ECM organisation and regulation of ERK pathways, and BMP signalling (BMP5 and BMP6 &amp; multiple receptor complexes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Macrophage, T cell, and dendritic cells are present in healthy hamstring tendon</title><p id="P30">Re-clustering of the identified immune cells (108 nuclei, ~1% of all nuclei) revealed two distinct cell clusters representing three different cell types. The three immune cell subsets were identified as macrophages <italic>(CD14, CD163, MERTK, MRC1, MSR1)</italic>, T cells <italic>(CD247, IL7R, CD69, THEMIS)</italic>, and dendritic cells <italic>(HLA-DQA1, CD74, GPAT3, CIITA, HLA-DRB1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Although further delineation of the T cell clusters was not possible due to the small number of cells and the low expression of CD4 and CD8 classical T cell markers, the expression of <italic>CD69</italic> could indicate that at least a subset of these cells are tissue-resident memory T cells. The strong expression of <italic>MERTK</italic> in the macrophage population also suggest that this population is mostly comprised of tissue-resident macrophages. Cell2location predicts the presence of immune cells in similar areas as vascular endothelium, but also in areas where skeletal muscle cells are predicted to be located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Presence of immune cells in hamstring tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, which showed that immune cells could mainly be found around vessels and colocalization of CD163 macrophages with CD3 T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). A relatively low number of potential ligand-receptor interactions were identified for immune cells, indicating a low activation state of the immune cells in our datasets, consistent with the samples coming from healthy hamstring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Reactome pathways enriched in immune cells included “Signal Transduction”, “Innate Immune System”, and “Adaptive Immune System” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Adipocytes, satellite cells, and nerve cells are found close to fibroblasts in healthy hamstring tendon</title><p id="P31">Finally, three cell types that were not previously reported in human tendon single cell transcriptomics studies, namely adipocytes, satellite cells, and nerve cells, which are undefined nervous system cells, were identified in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). This small cluster of nerve cells, or undefined nervous system cells, represented only ˜0.5% of all cells and expressed markers related to both nerve cells and glial cells. Adipocytes and satellite cells were identified by expression of known markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Cell2location analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) showed that adipocytes were predicted to be located in similar areas as PDGFRA+ fibroblasts and skeletal muscle cells (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, respectively), and satellite cells and nerve cells were predicted to be located in similar areas as fibroblasts and cells from the vascular compartment (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, respectively). Immunohistochemistry staining of PAX7 revealed that satellite cells are present in close proximity to muscle fibres within tendon tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). No enriched Reactome pathways were found for satellite cells. However, Reactome pathways “Metabolism” and “Metabolism of lipids” were significantly enriched in adipocytes and “Signal Transduction” in nerve cells, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">In this study, we systematically characterised healthy human hamstring tendon using snRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and imaging, resulting in a comprehensive atlas that can act as a reference map for future studies. SnRNA-seq was utilised in this study as it can deliver considerably enhanced extraction of nuclei from dense collagen-rich tissue and the removal of a stress-response to prolonged enzymatic digestion. Unsupervised clustering was used to identify 12 cell types, which were annotated according to known markers from the literature, differentially expressed genes, and pathway analysis. We confirmed the presence of two distinct fibroblast subsets along with endothelial cells, mural cells, and immune cells, and revealed the presence of less well-characterised cells, including different skeletal muscle cell types, satellite cells, adipocytes, and nerve cells. The low frequency of immune cells in our datasets (~1%) corroborates that this is indeed healthy tissue. Our datasets suggest that fibroblasts are key regulators of hamstring tendon tissue homeostasis due to their important role in the production and organisation of ECM as well as due the high number of potential ligand-receptor interactions, both within each fibroblast cell type as well as with all other cell types.</p><p id="P33">Our datasets show both similarities and differences with previous human single cell transcriptomics studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. These studies identified several different fibroblasts, mural cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells, including monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells. Most markers that were used to differentiate between different tenocyte populations in the paper by Kendal <italic>et al</italic>. were present in either both or neither of our fibroblast populations; markers used by Akbar <italic>et al</italic>. to identify normal tenocyte1 and normal tenocyte2 mostly aligned with our PDGFRA+ fibroblasts and MKX+ fibroblasts, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). However, these studies did not detect the presence of adipocytes and nerve cells in their tissues and have low representation of skeletal muscle cells or satellite cells. Differences between this study and previous studies could have arisen due to the fact that a greater number of healthy nuclei was analysed in our study or due to the differences in transcriptomics methods (single cell vs single nucleus approaches). While single cell transcriptomics generally capture more RNA per cell, including stable transcripts in the cytoplasm that might not be present in the nucleus, single nucleus transcriptomics enables the capture of a wider variety of cells, including cells that are hard to capture with single cell techniques due to the buoyancy or larger size of cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P34">Due to the origin of the tissue, it is unsurprising that skeletal muscle cells were found in hamstring tendon samples. The multinucleated nature of skeletal muscle combined with the low cellularity of tendon could explain the relatively high percentage of skeletal muscle cells (~45%) in our datasets. The limited number of predicted ligand-receptor interactions of skeletal muscle cell types with all other cell types suggests that skeletal muscle fibres might be present in healthy hamstring MTJ mostly for mechanical attachment. It is interesting to note that the PDGFRA+ fibroblast subset enriched in elastin biology sits spatially closer to the muscle and further study would be warranted to establish functional specialisation linked to mechanical attachment. The single cell transcriptomics study by Akbar <italic>et al</italic>. also identified a small muscle subset in their tendon datasets. However, the three markers defining the muscle cell subset were all present in the satellite cells but not skeletal muscle cells in our dataset, suggesting that these might have been satellite cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The satellite cells in our datasets did not cluster together with skeletal muscle cells and their regulon activation profile was more similar to non-skeletal muscle cells such as mural cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, than skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that there is a loss of satellite cells in skeletal muscle after tendon injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], illustrating that these cells can respond to changes in tendon. However, more work is needed to better understand the role and localisation of satellite cells as well as the potential interactions of these presumably skeletal muscle fibre-based cells with tendon-based cells.</p><p id="P35">Analysis of regulatory networks using SCENIC corroborated our snRNA-seq cell type definitions and also gave further insight into the potential functions of each identified cell type, especially the two fibroblast subsets. Regulons upregulated in the MKX+ fibroblasts include PAX9, which is involved in tendon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. However, most other regulons have previously been associated with other tissues: for example MAFB, which regulates macrophage differentiation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], and ZFHX3, which is associated with neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The link with neurons is intriguing as these MKX+ fibroblasts expressed high levels of <italic>PIEZO2</italic>, piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2, which is known to be critical for proprioception and has previously been identified in the Golgi tendon organs in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Further studies will be required to validate the function of these regulons in tendon fibroblasts. In the PDGFRA+ fibroblasts, the activated regulons include SHOX2, PRRX2, EBF2, CREB5, and TCF7L2, which are known to be involved in musculoskeletal and (early) limb development, as well as tendon healing; many of these factors are also involved in or can affect wnt/b-catenin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, PDGFRA+ cells have previously been identified as markers for progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and <italic>Tppp3+ Pdgfra+</italic> tendon cells have previously been identified as tendon-derived stem cells (TDSC) in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. While only a small percentage of the PDGFRA+ fibroblasts in our datasets expressed <italic>TPPP3</italic>, this PDGFRA+ fibroblast population warrants further investigation in larger datasets to explore the potential progenitor-like function of (a subpopulation) of these cells.</p><p id="P36">Limitations of this study include the small number of included samples in transcriptomic methods. Although different cell types were identified that have not been reported on earlier, the addition of further samples would enable annotation of cell types with more granularity, as well as comparisons of features such as donor sex, age, and side of tendon. The possible functions of and interaction between different cell types were predicted based on mRNA expression only. Two difficulties with this are that snRNA-seq might not cover stable transcripts that are only present in the cytoplasm, and that the presence or lack of mRNA expression does not always translate to the presence or lack of protein expression. Therefore, additional studies are needed to validate cell-cell interactions and discover their functional effects. This might especially give more insight into the differences and similarities of the two different fibroblast cell types identified in this study. While spatial transcriptomics data was able to add some information about the presence and distribution of different cell types across the tissue, analysis is limited due to use of one sample in one tissue slice orientation. The lack of single-cell resolution in spatial transcriptomics and difficulty in accurate normalisation due to high variability in RNA expression levels between muscle and tendon areas were also limiting. The low cellularity of tendon and low transcriptional activity of the cells results in low detection of RNA in many parts of the tissue. The large differences in expression between high and low cellularity regions of the tissue could have biased the predicted locations of cells. Therefore, other spatial analysis techniques might be better suited to understand the spatial distribution of cells in tendon. Cell subsets were identified using RNA markers, and where possible these were validated by imaging methods. However, in some cases we were unable to obtain suitable antibodies (such as for mohawk).</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of cellular composition of healthy human hamstring tendon by using both transcriptional and spatial analyses. We show that healthy human hamstring tendon is comprised of wide range of cell types, including both previously demonstrated cell types such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mural cells, and immune cells, as well as less well-characterised cells, including different skeletal muscle cell types, satellite cells, adipocytes, and nerve cells. We identified two distinct types of fibroblasts, which are suggested to be the major regulators of tendon tissue homeostasis due their role in the production and organisation of ECM, the high number of predicted interactions with all other cell types, and the wide distribution across the tissue. Our datasets form the foundation of a comprehensive cellular atlas of healthy tendons that can act as a reference map for future studies, and will help dissect mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and identify new therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS158937-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d37aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS158937-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d37aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank our research assistant Louise Appleton, our research nurses Debra Beazley, Bridget Watkins, Kim Wheway, and Lois Vesty-Edwards, and the knee surgeon team at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, for their invaluable help collecting human tissue for this study.
