Among US adults, the prevalence of obesity and DM are 41.9% and 14.8%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The relationship between DM and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality caused by a variety of infectious diseases has long been recognized, especially in older adults with DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Similarly, DM and obesity are risk factors of severe COVID-19 or death, along with other factors such as older age, male sex, and underlying comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The prevalence of these metabolic disorders indicates an urgent need to prevent the incidence of severe infections, specifically COVID-19, in these vulnerable populations to reduce disease burden.</p><p id="P18">Despite improving overall disease outcomes, many currently approved vaccines, including the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, are not as effective in patients with DM or obesity. Following the introduction of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies found that Type 2 DM (T2DM) is associated with significant reductions in both humoral and cellular responses to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, particularly among those with poor glycemic control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Reduced vaccine immunogenicity has been observed among adults, especially men, with obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that metabolic diseases impair vaccine responses and increase the risk of severe COVID-19. However, the exact effects of metabolic disease on the quality of humoral and cellular immune responses remain unclear. There is therefore a need to assess the causes of impaired vaccine response in those with metabolic disease and evaluate what aspects of immunity are affected to inform optimization of vaccine approaches for this vulnerable population.</p><p id="P19">While our understanding of the influence of obesity and T2DM on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses remains limited, murine models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and insulin resistance have facilitated initial studies of the connections between metabolic disease, immunity, and viral disease pathology, particularly in the context of influenza. Following infection with influenza, DIO mice exhibited higher lung damage and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Further, DIO mice mounted impaired immune responses following immunization with subunit or inactivated-virus influenza vaccines, including decreased antibody (Ab) titers relative to controls, lower CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell levels, impaired protection from live viral challenge, and greater waning in humoral immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, studies of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection have found that DIO mice exhibit increased lung titers and/or greater morbidity and mortality following live-virus challenge relative to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, little is known regarding the effects of obesity and hyperglycemia on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses. Furthermore, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of obesity and hyperglycemia on mRNA vaccine immunogenicity in detail despite the widespread use of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the clinic.</p><p id="P20">We therefore sought to address these gaps by evaluating the effects of obesity and T2DM on Ab levels and function, T cell responses, and protection from live SARS-CoV-2 challenge in animals that received the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. To this end, we established a mouse model of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance using a high-fat diet (HFD) and then immunized mice with BNT162b2 or an alum adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) subunit vaccine. We then assessed binding and neutralizing Ab titers, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, and protection from infection during viral challenge. We found that HFD-induced obesity and T2DM impaired both humoral and cellular immune responses post-BNT162b2 immunization. HFD-fed mice had significantly lower neutralizing titers and IgG2c titers compared to mice fed with a normal diet (ND). Furthermore, while ND mice exhibited RBD-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, T cell activation profiles were not significantly enhanced in HFD mice when compared to a PBS-injected control. In line with these immunogenicity data, lung viral titers and inflammation profiles after viral challenge were only significantly reduced relative to the PBS-injected group among ND mice, while no significant reduction versus the PBS group was observed in the HFD group. Overall, our study demonstrates that diet-induced obesity and T2DM in a murine model reduce immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, laying the groundwork for further study of the mechanisms of these deficiencies and strategies that can be used to overcome them.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S9"><title>A high-fat diet causes weight gain, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance in male C57BL/6J mice</title><p id="P21">We first confirmed that feeding a HFD led to diet-induced obesity (DIO), fasting hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance in male C57BL/6J mice as previously observed for this model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To this end, mice were fed a HFD containing 60% kcal from fat or a ND containing 10% kcal from fat beginning at age 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Animals were transferred from the supplier at 15 weeks old, allowed to acclimate for two weeks, and weighed weekly through the post-vaccination blood draw at 30 weeks of age. After feeding mice the HFD for 18 weeks, fasting serum insulin was measured. Glucose intolerance was measured via an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) the following week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, mice that received a HFD were significantly heavier than mice fed a ND throughout the experiment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 at all time points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The HFD mice were visually distinct from the ND mice, appearing much wider and rounder throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). During the week of the prime vaccination, HFD mice ranged from 37.2 to 61.2 g, with an average weight of 48.8 g, while ND mice ranged from 26.9 to 36.8 g, averaging 31.8 g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition to weight gain, HFD mice also developed hyperinsulinemia, with significantly elevated fasting serum insulin levels as compared to ND mice at age 24 weeks (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Further, serum insulin demonstrated a significant positive correlation with weight in both the ND mice (<italic>r</italic> = 0.4369, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0061) and HFD mice (<italic>r</italic> = 0.6194, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), suggesting an association between weight gain and hyperinsulinemia, particularly in mice that received a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Finally, we employed an IPGTT to assess glucose intolerance in HFD mice versus ND mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). HFD mice had a significantly higher median blood glucose following a 6-hour fast than ND mice (244 mg/dL vs. 170 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Following intraperitoneal injection of 2 g/kg dextrose, HFD mice maintained significantly higher blood glucose measurements than ND mice at 30, 75, and 120 minutes after injection (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) and ended at a median of 600 mg/dL versus 225 mg/dL in ND mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Moreover, 21 of the 38 HFD mice remained &gt; 600 mg/dL, the blood glucose meter’s upper limit of detection, at the final time point (120 minutes after injection), in contrast with none of the ND mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>HFD mice elicited impaired antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination</title><p id="P22">Following establishment of the comorbid obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance phenotypes, mice were immunized with SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA or a protein subunit vaccine benchmark vaccine at a 2-dose regimen with a 14-day interval to assess the effects of the HFD on vaccine immunogenicity and protective efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Mice were randomly assigned to receive 1 μg of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA (Comirnaty®), or 10 μg of recombinant monomeric SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein formulated with 100 μg of aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel®). Within the HFD or ND mice, each vaccine treatment group had generally comparable weights, insulin levels, and IPGTT results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Immunizations were given intramuscularly to mice at 26 and 28 weeks of age. Two weeks after the 2<sup>nd</sup> immunization, humoral immunity was assessed.</p><p id="P23">In ND mice, robust humoral responses were observed after BNT162b2 immunization, while an alum-adjuvanted RBD subunit vaccine induced limited Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B–E</xref>). Importantly, among mice that received BNT162b2, there was a 2.2-fold reduction in anti-spike IgG in HFD mice compared to ND mice (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In further IgG subclass assessment, there was a large reduction in anti-spike IgG2c in HFD mice compared to ND mice post BNT162b2 immunization (GMTs of 105191 vs. 14250, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) although the difference in IgG1 titers was not significant. Accordingly, the Ab response was significantly skewed toward IgG2c in ND mice relative to HFD mice, with mean IgG2c:IgG1 ratios of 2.81 versus 0.87, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). RBD plays a key role in ACE2 binding and is the main target of neutralizing Abs. We thus assessed anti-RBD IgG titers and confirmed a significant reduction in anti-RBD IgG2c in HFD mice compared to ND mice post BNT162b2 immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To analyze Ab function, we next performed a surrogate of virus neutralization test that measures the degree of inhibition of RBD binding to hACE2 by immune sera, as well as a neutralization assay with live SARS-CoV-2 virus. HFD mice exhibited significantly impaired hACE2-RBD binding inhibition and live virus neutralization relative to ND mice post BNT162b2 immunization (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). To assess the effects of obesity and T2DM on humoral immunity individually, correlations between either weight at the time of immunization or fasting insulin, measures associated with obesity and diabetic phenotypes, respectively, and Ab responses were assessed in HFD mice. Interestingly, serum insulin, but not weight, negatively correlated with anti-spike IgG2c titers (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.334 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that, relative to control mice fed a ND, HFD mice mount impaired Ab responses following immunization with BNT162b2, marked by a reduction in anti-spike IgG titers, a lower IgG2c:IgG1 ratio, impaired inhibition of hACE2-RBD binding, and a reduction in live virus neutralizing titers.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>HFD mice exhibit impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination</title><p id="P25">SARS-CoV-2 spike specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are elicited by mRNA vaccines and contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore analyzed spike RBD-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses of the HFD and ND mice 4 weeks after the final immunization. Splenocytes were collected and stimulated with overlapping peptides of the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Intracellular expression of interferon-γ (IFNγ), TNF, and IL-2 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was assessed by flow cytometry to quantify antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As expected, BNT162b2 immunization elicited significantly higher CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expression of IFNγ, TNF, and IL-2 than PBS injection in ND mice (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.010, respectively), while alum-adjuvanted RBD subunit vaccine was not significant versus PBS for any cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B–D</xref>). In contrast, neither BNT162b2 nor alum-adjuvanted RBD significantly induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell IFNγ, TNF, or IL-2 expression versus PBS among HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B–D</xref>). While only the ND mice exhibited a significant vaccine-induced increase in cytokine expression over their corresponding PBS group, there was not a significant difference in cytokine expression comparing HFD and ND mice when compared head-to-head within the BNT162b2 vaccination condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B–D</xref>). However, the median percentages of IFNγ, TNF, and IL-2 positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were all at least 2-fold greater in ND mice than in HFD mice (2.4-, 2.0-, and 2.9-fold, respectively). Overall, significant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation was observed in ND but not HFD mice that received the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, indicating an impaired antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell Spike response in HFD mice.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine protects ND mice but not HFD mice from lung infection</title><p id="P26">To assess vaccine efficacy, we challenged immunized mice with live SARS-CoV-2.

Mice were weighed before infection, and the HFD mice remained significantly heavier, with a mean weight of 52.7 g versus a mean of 34.0 g among ND mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Two days after infection, mice were euthanized, and lungs were harvested for analysis. Minor inflammation was seen in all lung samples, though differences between groups were undetectable in line with the early timepoint following infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

PBS-injected HFD and ND mice both demonstrated high inflammatory responses across multiple genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Of note, BNT162b2-immunized ND mice demonstrated significant lower gene expression relative to PBS group, while there was no significant difference between HFD mice that received PBS or BNT162b2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To further determine protective efficacy, lung viral titers were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Naive, PBS-injected mice demonstrated robust viral loads in both HFD and ND mice (geometric means: 1.58 x 10<sup>8</sup> and 6.20 x 10<sup>9</sup>, respectively). In line with the low immunogenicity data, both HFD and ND mice vaccinated with alum-adjuvanted RBD were not protected from lung infection (geometric means: 2.61 x 10<sup>7</sup> and 3.80 x 10<sup>8</sup> in HFD and ND mice respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similar to the pattern of expression observed for inflammatory genes, ND mice that received BNT162b2 exhibited a significant decrease in lung viral titer relative to the PBS group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004), while there was no significant difference between HFD mice that received PBS or BNT162b2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.535, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Compared to HFD, ND mice that received BNT162b2 demonstrated a 262-fold reduction in lung viral titers (geometric means: 9.25 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and 3.53 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> in HFD and ND mice, respectively), though this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.175, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Lastly, to define immune correlates of protection, we assessed correlations between neutralizing titers and challenge study readouts.

T2DM and obesity are known risk factors for severe COVID-19 and have been correlated with reduced responses to mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, a causal link between these conditions and impaired vaccine responses has not yet been established. Using DIO mouse models, previous studies have recapitulated pathological findings of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 observed in humans, establishing this model as a viable option for studying the relationship between metabolic disease and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we developed a mouse model of metabolic disease by feeding mice a HFD, which led to obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. We then immunized mice with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, an alum-adjuvanted RBD subunit vaccine, or a PBS control, after which we assessed Ab and T cell responses and protection from viral challenge. We found that HFD mice exhibited an overall reduction in BNT162b2 response relative to ND mice, marked by a reduction in neutralizing Abs. We also observed significantly enhanced RBD-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell induction only in ND mice but not in HFD mice. Furthermore, BNT162b2-vaccinated HFD mice exhibited a lack of protection from live viral challenge relative to PBS-injected HFD mice, while BNT162b2-vaccinated ND mice demonstrated protection relative to the PBS-injected ND mice.</p><p id="P29">We observed that in HFD mice, BNT162b2 vaccine demonstrated a consistent and cumulative pattern of reduced immunogenicity across multiple measures, including binding and neutralizing Ab titers and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Interestingly, while antigen-specific IgG1 titers were comparable among HFD and ND mice, the induction of IgG2c Abs was substantially reduced in HFD mice relative to ND mice. We also observed that, unlike ND mice, HFD mice failed to mount significant mRNA vaccine-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and expression of Th1-associated cytokines including IFNγ, associated with favorable disease outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As IFNγ promotes isotype switching toward IgG2c <italic>in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup></italic>, these two observations are likely linked. Our study is consistent with impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses following influenza vaccination and natural infection in HFD mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, susceptibility to infection in HFD mice may in part be due to impaired generation of IgG2c Ab subclass, associated with greater effector functions (e.g., induction of phagocytosis, complement fixation) likely important for host defense against infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Overall, our data demonstrate that HFD obese and diabetic mice have distinct immunity with impaired generation of neutralizing Abs and IFNγ-driven type 1 immunity.</p><p id="P30">To evaluate whether immunogenicity data translate into protection, we performed a live challenge study. Here, we observed a significant reduction in lung inflammatory responses and lung viral titers relative to PBS-injected mice at day 2 post-infection among ND mice but not in HFD mice. As expected, and in line with immunogenicity data, this result demonstrates that BNT162b2-immunized HFD mice are not protected from challenge, while ND mice are mostly protected. Notably, we did not observe worse disease outcomes (i.e., high viral titers and lung inflammatory responses) in naive, PBS-injected HFD mice compared to ND mice, despite prior observations of more severe disease in HFD animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, the shorter duration of follow-up post challenge, which was chosen to maximize observable differences in lung viral titers, likely accounts for these discrepancies.</p><p id="P31">By establishing a causal connection between metabolic disease and vaccine efficacy, our study lays the groundwork for future inquiries into the mechanisms behind diminished vaccine responses. T2DM and obesity are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, also known as ‘metaflammation’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, sharing features with ‘inflammaging’, the chronic, sterile, low-grade , inflammatory state that characterizes aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Metaflammation and inflammaging both contribute to the key pathogenesis of metabolomic- or age-related diseases–however, the association and its mechanism on vaccine immunogenicity are not fully elucidated. Senescent cells in older adults provoked CCR2 positive monocyte-dependent inflammation and diminished T cell responses to viruses via secretion of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a short-term inhibition of inflammatory responses boosted adaptive immunity in aged mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Additionally, T2DM-induced insulin resistance in humans has been linked with impaired ability for CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs), which then also show reduced classical DC maturation and antigen presenting function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In light of these published studies, our overall findings suggest that hyper-inflammatory states associated with obesity and type 2 DM likely mediated the observed deficits in vaccine response among HFD mice. Future studies should elucidate the mechanistic connections between metabolic disease and vaccine immunogenicity, which could enable implementation of targeted strategies to overcome deficits in vaccine response in vulnerable populations with distinct immunity.</p><p id="P32">While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines tailored for those with obesity or T2DM do not yet exist, strategies to develop precision vaccines for specific age populations have been investigated. In line with our approach to modeling metabolic disease, age-specific murine models have demonstrated reduced immunogenicity, higher mortality and morbidity, and greater waning immunity in aged mice, comparable to the observations in older adult humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. A booster of mRNA vaccine provided sterilizing immunity against Omicron-induced lung infection in aged 21-month-old mice, while younger mice are protected without a booster, indicating the importance of age-specific vaccine regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Through the development of an appropriate adjuvant for a SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine, greater protection has been observed in aged mice despite age-related declines in immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Based on this precedent, we hypothesize that similar approaches could help overcome metabolic disease-associated deficits in vaccine response. Of note, adjuvants can not only enhance vaccinal immunity but also shape the polarization of the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Defining optimal adjuvant formulation could therefore be a promising approach to overcome the reduced Th1 polarization observed among diabetic obese mice in this study. In combination with further studies elucidating the mechanisms of impaired vaccine responses among those with metabolic disease, an adjuvant approach therefore represents a promising future direction toward effective vaccines tailored to those with T2DM and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">Our study has several major strengths, including (a) the comprehensive assessment of a causal connection between metabolic disease and reduced BNT162b2 immunogenicity among neutralizing Abs, IgG2c subclasses, and cytotoxic T cells, and (b) evaluation of protective efficacy from live SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Despite these strengths, we recognize several limitations in the current study, including that (a) only male mice were used due to the increased severity of obesity and insulin resistance in male C57BL/6J mice relative to females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, (b) only one mouse model was used, establishing the need for future translational research in additional animal models and humans, (c) the overall magnitude of antigen-specific T cell responses were low even after mRNA vaccination due to the use of RBD-specific peptide pool instead of full spike-peptide pool, and (d) although we showed the association with HFD mice and an impairment of type 1 immunity, we were not able to demonstrate the contribution for protection as we had to euthanize mice and collect splenocytes to assess T cell response. Nevertheless, the implications of metabolic disease on BNT162b2 immunogenicity are clear, laying the groundwork for further study into the mechanisms of impaired immune responses, especially focused on a) insulin resistance and b) methods for overcoming these phenomena both in animal models and eventually in the clinic. In parallel to this precision vaccinology approach, public health initiatives that promote physical exercise and a health body weight, both know to help curtail insulin resistance, should be adopted.</p><p id="P34">Overall, this study aimed to analyze the effects of obesity and insulin resistance on immunogenicity and protective efficacy following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We demonstrated that HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance led to reduced humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Furthermore, a weakened protective efficacy was shown in HFD mice post BNT162b2 immunization. These observations establish the need to develop precision vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens tailored for those with obesity and DM to overcome impaired immune responses in groups already at high risk of severe infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Study design</title><p id="P35">This study aimed to assess the effects of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance on BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical mouse models.
