The tripartite multidrug efflux pump system from <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> AcrAB-TolC, is a target for inhibition to lessen resistance development and restore antibiotic efficacy, with homologs in other ESKAPE pathogens. Here, we rationalize a mechanism of inhibition against the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, using a combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cellular efflux assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We define the structural dynamics of AcrA and find that an inhibitor can inflict long-range stabilisation across all four of its domains, whereas an interacting efflux substrate has minimal effect. Our results support a model where an inhibitor forms a molecular wedge within a cleft between the lipoyl and αβ domains of AcrA, diminishing its conformational transmission of drug-evoked signals from AcrB to TolC. This work provides molecular insights into multidrug adaptor protein function which could be valuable for developing antimicrobial therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Multidrug resistance refers to the ability of bacterial pathogens to survive lethal doses from many structurally diverse compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Bacterial multidrug resistance continues to spread at alarming rates, threatening human health globally.

Energized by the proton motive force, AcrB transports substrates, including antibiotics, from the intracellular environment to the outside of the cell, through a sealed channel formed by AcrA and TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Efforts have been made to develop efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) against these systems to ‘revive’ the activities of various pre-existing antibiotics, which a bacterial population has become resistant to.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Until now, the focus has been to generate EPIs targeting the AcrB transporter itself. However, previously identified EPIs have failed to progress to clinical trials, due to toxicity issues and the promiscuous nature of AcrB to transport its inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Thus, there is a need to explore other avenues in the quest to generate successful EPIs, with AcrA emerging as a potential target for inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Recently, NSC 60339 was identified as an AcrA inhibitor through a joint experimental-computational screen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Previous work suggested NSC 60339 could cause a conformational change in AcrA, and proposed a possible binding site at the interface between the lipoyl and αβ barrel domains, termed site IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Moreover, AcrA has recently been shown to have more diverse functions, being identified as a bacterial ‘necrosignal’ within <italic>E. coli</italic> swarms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>: when a subpopulation of the swarm dies, dead cells release the necrosignal AcrA, which binds TolC on the outside of other live cells, stimulating efflux within the affected area and the upregulation of various efflux pumps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, recent work has also shown that NSC 60339 can inhibit AcrA-mediated necrosignalling ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Understanding the molecular mechanisms of AcrA inhibition is therefore important for future EPI and necrosignalling drug discovery. However, a mechanism of AcrA inhibition remains elusive.</p><p id="P5">AcrA acts as a flexible adaptor protein between AcrB and TolC, with its elongated shape essential for this function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> It has been proposed to form a trimer of dimers in the assembled complex to maintain a sealed channel, and accommodate the conformational movement of AcrB as it cycles through its rotational efflux mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> After signal peptide cleavage AcrA is lipidated at Cys25, which anchors it to the inner membrane, although previous studies have shown that the presence of the lipid moiety is not required for AcrA function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> AcrA consists of four linearly arranged domains, the α-helical hairpin, lipoyl, αβ barrel and membrane proximal (MP) domains, each connected by small flexible linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The αβ barrel and MP domains interact with AcrB, whereas the α-helical domain interacts with the periplasmic, α-helical coiled coils of TolC, where it is proposed to regulate its ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Here, we used a combination of native and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (nMS and HDX-MS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, biophysical and cellular efflux assays to determine a mechanism of action for the AcrA inhibitor, NSC 60339.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Our data suggests that NSC 60339 acts as a molecular wedge within a cleft between the lipoyl and αβ barrel domains of AcrA, reducing its structural dynamics across all four domains. Furthermore, we investigated an efflux substrate, novobiocin, which is known to bind to AcrA, but does not inhibit efflux, revealing minimal change in AcrA dynamics in the presence of novobiocin. We also performed <italic>in vivo</italic> efflux assays with AcrA mutants, to investigate whether deliberately restricting AcrA dynamics at the lipoyl-αβ and the αβ-MP flexible linkers could affect efflux. This confirmed the lipoyl-αβ cleft as a druggable site for targeting conformational restriction during efflux and revealed a possible site between the αβ-MP domains for future drug design. Overall, our results suggest that NSC 60339 inhibits efflux via restriction of AcrA structural dynamics, which could reduce the efficiency of AcrAB-TolC functional rotation and possibly perturb interactions within the complex itself during efflux and necrosignalling.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">To best mimic the periplasmic environment of AcrA - the cytosol is on average 1.7 pH units higher than the external environment - we performed our investigations at pH 6.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> This will also ensure that our findings are consistent with previous microbiological and biochemical work performed on NSC 60339, which was completed at pH 6.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Consequently, our HDX labelling times were amended to accurately represent typical labelling times at physiological pH (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>), as pH influences the exchange rates of HDX.</p><sec id="S3"><title>AcrA consists of both structured and disordered regions</title><p id="P8">To understand AcrA structural dynamics we optimized our sample for investigation by HDX-MS, which provides molecular level information on protein conformation and dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> HDX occurs when amide hydrogens on the peptide backbone become accessible to deuterated buffer, and undergo isotopic exchange with D2O. Accessibility results from structural unfolding and hydrogen bond breakage, thus unstructured regions exhibit rapid exchange when exposed to solvent, whereas regions with stable secondary structures exhibit slower exchange as these regions are protected and stabilised by hydrogen bonding networks. To enable reliable interpretation of the effect of inhibitor and substrate interactions on AcrA dynamics, we explored constructs that would ensure sample homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We monitored oligomeric homogeneity by nMS, which allows intact proteins to be transferred to the gas phase whilst preserving non-covalent interactions and, thus, is adept at reporting on protein oligomeric states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">We first purified AcrA containing its signal peptide (residues 1-24), which is cleaved after lipidation at Cys25 (AcrA<sup>L</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> This construct is associated with the membrane and was therefore purified from the membrane in <italic>n</italic>-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent micelles. nMS revealed AcrA<sup>L</sup> existed as a mixture of monomers and dimers at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>); at pH 7.4 AcrA<sup>L</sup> had increased heterogeneity, forming monomers and up to pentamers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1</xref>). This degree of heterogeneity would complicate HDX-MS interpretation, therefore, we considered AcrA lacking the lipidation (AcrA<sup>S</sup>), which has previously been shown to retain its functionality and has been utilised in several other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> AcrA<sup>S</sup> lacks its signal peptide (residues 1-24) and has its Cys25 replaced by a starting methionine (Met25). It is expressed and purified from the cytosol and lacks lipidation on its N-terminus. nMS studies of AcrA<sup>S</sup> revealed it was entirely monomeric at both pH 7.4 and 6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, we decided to proceed with the AcrA<sup>S</sup> construct for our investigations at pH 6.0.</p><p id="P10">As AcrA forms a trimer of dimers in the assembled complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, we also explored an AcrA pseudo-dimer construct (AcrA<sup>SD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This will enable us to probe the effect of dimerization on AcrA structural dynamics, and how NSC 60339 inhibition is affected by the presence of a dimer interface. The construct contained two AcrA<sup>S</sup> sequences connected by a five amino acid linker, and nMS confirms it to be a homogenous pseudo-dimer at pH 6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Aside from elucidating stoichiometry, charge state distributions (CSDs) seen in nMS spectra can report on conformational properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> Interestingly, our nMS spectra indicate AcrA could contain areas of intrinsic disorder in all constructs. nMS spectra of all three constructs present at least two CSDs, reflecting populations of folded and more unstructured conformers occurring during protein ionisation into the gas phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S1</xref>).It has been found that mixed CSDs such as these are diagnostic of folded proteins containing areas of intrinsic disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> This area is likely to be the MP domain as previously postulated, as it is often unresolved in crystal structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">Next, we used HDX-MS to assess the intrinsic dynamics of our AcrA constructs. After quench and digestion optimization on AcrA<sup>S</sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S3</xref>), we could achieve &gt;95% sequence coverage for our HDX-MS investigations. A relative fractional deuterium uptake analysis of AcrA<sup>S</sup> reveals areas with time-dependent exchange, characteristic of a folded protein with differences in secondary structure and dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S4</xref>). The α-helices show a strong level of protection throughout the entire HDX time course, suggesting this is the most structurally stable area of AcrA. However, peptides within areas of the MP (residues 25-42, 375-380) and αβ barrel domains (residue 264-275) demonstrated maximum deuterium incorporation even at the earliest time points (10 seconds), which is indicative of unstructured regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> This further supports that the MP domain predominantly contains areas of intrinsic disorder. Thus, we classify AcrA as a folded protein with areas of intrinsic disorder. This likely benefits AcrA functionally as a PAP, as the periplasm is a dynamic environment that can change size under different conditions, and AcrA is required to be flexible enough to accommodate these changes to maintain a sealed channel in the assembled complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>An efflux pump inhibitor, NSC 60339, causes long-range restriction of the AcrA backbone</title><p id="P13">To explore the effects of NSC 60339 inhibition on AcrA<sup>S</sup>, we performed differential HDX (ΔHDX) between AcrA<sup>S</sup> + NSC 60339 and AcrA<sup>S</sup> alone. ΔHDX analyses the difference between two states and is a sensitive approach to characterize, and localize, the effect of a condition on the structural dynamics of a protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> For a given peptide, we calculate the amount of deuterium incorporated in each protein state (no drug/NSC 60339/novobiocin) by comparing the centroid <italic>m/z</italic> for a given time point to a non-deuterated reference sample. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, we can see that for a representative peptide (residues 308-323), after 1 minute the amount of deuterium incorporated is the same for AcrA<sup>S</sup> without drug and with novobiocin, yet in the presence of NSC 60339 there is &gt; 1 Da reduction in deuterium uptake.</p><p id="P14">In the presence of NSC 60339, AcrA<sup>S</sup> exhibited stabilisation across all four domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>), with the site IV region - identified as a possible binding site within a cleft between lipoyl and αβ domains by computational modelling and Trp fluorescence spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> – being affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-B</xref>). Portions of site IV exhibited a significant decrease in deuterium uptake in the presence of NSC 60339 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-D</xref>), with peptides including residues F81 and F254 showing decreased uptake. Residue F81 (lipoyl domain) and F254 (αβ domain) are both implicated in NSC 60339 binding with F81 also being essential for efflux function. HDX reduction within these areas may be due to drug binding stabilising the local area through direct interactions with amide hydrogens, or a reduction in solvent accessibility within the implicated domains. Based on the docked structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), F81 and F254 bracket site IV but do not make direct contact with NSC 60339. However, in MD simulations, both show reduced fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) as well as reduced solvent-accessible surface area (SASA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), demonstrating how binding of NSC 60339 can have allosteric effects on different regions of AcrA. Our HDX-MS and MD data, together with the previous work, support that site IV is the binding site of NSC 60339.</p><p id="P15">Aside from site IV, our data reveals that NSC 60339 induces long range stabilisation of AcrA structural dynamics away from the NSC 60339 binding site. The α-helical hairpins show stabilisation on both helices and the flexible linker, primarily in the later time points. This is likely due to the stabilisation exhibited by the lipoyl domain due to NSC 60339, restricting the ability of AcrA to freely position the helices, possibly reducing its conformational plasticity. Additionally, the MP domain exhibits extensive protection in the presence of NSC 60339. The largest degree of protection in the MP domain occurs between residues 308-324, with multiple peptides within this region showing a sustained protection throughout the entire HDX time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Our data supports that the effects seen in these domains are a downstream effect of NSC 60339 rather than secondary binding sites. Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) from our MD simulations of the bound and apo states show a high degree of stabilisation of residues 308-324 even compared to other residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S5</xref>), supporting our HDX data and providing confidence that NSC 60339 can cause long range stabilisation of dynamics away from the proposed binding site. It has also been shown that AcrA lacking the MP domain is still bound by NSC 60339, advocating that its stabilisation is allosteric to NSC 60339 binding to site IV. In contrast to the MP domain, the difference in RMSF for the lipoyl domain was modest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S5</xref>); however, portions of the lipoyl domain did see reduced SASA, possibly explaining the increased protection observed by HDX-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S6</xref>).</p><p id="P16">As a control and a comparison to NSC 60339, we investigated the effect of novobiocin on AcrA<sup>S</sup> dynamics. Novobiocin is a substrate of AcrAB-TolC, binds to AcrA and yet does not classify as an EPI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> As before, we performed differential HDX on AcrA<sup>S</sup> + novobiocin and AcrA<sup>S</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S7</xref>). Our data shows that novobiocin has little observed effect on AcrA structural dynamics within our HDX experiments, which is in stark contrast to NSC 60339. The peptide uptake plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> show three peptides across three domains that exhibit statistically significant protection when inhibited by NSC 60339 (blue plot). The black plot represents the uptake for a peptide in the presence of novobiocin, and the green plot represents AcrA<sup>S</sup> alone. As the uptake plots show, there is no difference in deuterium incorporation between AcrA<sup>S</sup> alone and with novobiocin, even though the percentage of protein: ligand complex was the same (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). As a supporting experiment, we monitored novobiocin binding to AcrA<sup>S</sup> using native-MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S2</xref>) and observed the protein-ligand complex. Overall, our data suggests that whilst it is a substrate of AcrA, novobiocin does not have global effects on structural dynamics like NSC 60339. This supports our premise that NSC 60339 is a successful inhibitor of AcrA due to its ability to stabilise AcrA across all four of its domains. AcrA relies on its dynamism and flexibility to function as a PAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, so restricting this conformational ability may be a promising target for inhibition in general.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NSC 60339 acts in a similar fashion against an AcrA pseudo-dimer</title><p id="P17">To characterise the effect of dimerization on AcrA structural dynamics we performed differential HDX between the monomer and dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S9</xref>). AcrA<sup>SD</sup> experienced areas of decreased HDX compared to AcrA<sup>S</sup>, and therefore a stabilisation across all four domains. The area that exhibited the largest decrease in ΔHDX was the α-helical hairpin in the latest time point (10 mins). This protection could be explained by complementary packing of the α-helical hairpins in the dimer leading to a stabilisation of its structure and possible solvent exclusion in the binding interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> The MP domain also exhibited protection at the later time points between residues 306-342 and the αβ barrel (residues 261-288) in the early time points (10-60 seconds), suggesting dimerization may also provide more structural order to these regions.</p><p id="P18">Our HDX-MS data shows that the AcrA<sup>SD</sup> has unique dynamics compared to the monomer, even though it possesses similar thermal stability to the AcrA<sup>S</sup> construct, as judged by circular dichroism (CD, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S10</xref>). This may aid in its association in a complex with AcrB. To test this, we compared the binding of AcrA<sup>S</sup> and AcrA<sup>SD</sup> to AcrB in SMALP (Styrene Maleic Acid Lipid Particles) nanodiscs using SMA-PAGE, which is a native-PAGE method adapted for use with SMALPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S11</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> It yields stoichiometric information and can reveal protein complex formation. AcrA<sup>S</sup> appears to bind trimeric AcrB SMALPs in a 1:1 model, as previously reported, yet AcrA<sup>SD</sup> appears to bind trimeric AcrB in a range of different stoichiometries, which were not resolved by SMA-PAGE analysis, suggesting dimerization promotes higher-order AcrA interaction(s) with trimeric AcrB embedded in a lipid environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup></p><p id="P19">To characterize AcrA<sup>SD</sup> interactions with NSC 60339, we used a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding assay.

We found that the two AcrA variants bound NSC 60339 with similar affinities and kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This result suggests that pseudo-dimerization does not affect the mode of interaction of NSC 60339 with the AcrA binding site.</p><p id="P20">To investigate if AcrA dimerization has an effect on NSC 60339 inhibition, we repeated our differential HDX experiments with the AcrA<sup>SD</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Our data shows that NSC 60339 acts in a similar way when AcrA is a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). There is statistically significant protection across all four domains as seen with AcrA<sup>S</sup>, with pronounced HDX protection across the lipoyl domain, where site IV is located, suggesting the drug is acting in a similar area. Furthermore, AcrA<sup>SD</sup> exhibits extensive protection in the MP domain, with the core of this stabilisation happening at the same region (residues 306-324). There is also a stabilisation across the α2 helix in the α-helical hairpin; however, fewer peptides and a smaller region compared to AcrA<sup>S</sup>. One possibility for this may be due to the packing of the hairpins in the dimer already making the region more stable compared to the monomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S9</xref>). Thus, the hairpins may be less effected by NSC 60339 inhibition in the dimer.</p><p id="P21">Interestingly, our data shows there is a reduced region of the αβ domain being stabilised, on the other side of site IV. When AcrA<sup>SD</sup> is inhibited with NSC 60339, only residues 232-246 and 249-261 show significant protection, whereas AcrA<sup>S</sup> shows protection between residues 228-260 and 52-62, which may suggest a difference in how the drug is interacting within the binding site.</p><p id="P22">Overall, NSC 60339 appears to be inhibiting AcrA<sup>SD</sup> in a similar way, by reducing AcrA’s structural dynamics across the entire protein. To support this hypothesis, we also ran simulations of the bound and apo states of a modelled AcrA<sup>SD</sup> starting from an existing crystal structure (PDB 2F1M).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> A notable reduction in the RMSF for the bound state was observed over most of both copies of the protein compared to the apo state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S12</xref>).</p><p id="P23">As before, we also investigated the effect of novobiocin on AcrA<sup>SD</sup>.

For this purpose, we constructed the plasmid borne <italic>acrAB</italic> with <italic>acrA</italic> variants containing unique Cys substitutions in the flexible linkers between the MP and αβ barrel (Leu50Cys, Ile52Cys, Arg225Cys, Glu229Cys, Asn232Cys) and between the αβ barrel and lipoyl domain (Arg183Cys, Thr205Cys, Asp284Cys) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Cells producing the WT and AcrA(Cys)B variants were treated with a Cys-reactive probe MTS-rhodamine 6G (MTS-R6G). This probe is a substrate of AcrAB-TolC and its covalent binding to Cys residues of AcrA located in positions important for conformational flexibility and/or function of the protein is expected to inhibit efflux activity of AcrAB-TolC pump. In this assay, we used hyperporinated <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ9-Pore cells lacking all nine TolC-dependent transporters and carrying the plasmid borne AcrA(Cys)AcrB variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> Hyperporination of the OM has eliminated the permeability barrier of the OM and facilitated MTS penetration into the periplasm to reach AcrA(Cys). Cells were pre-treated with MTS, the unreacted probe washed away and the kinetics of efflux of a fluorescent substrate Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst) was analyzed.</p><p id="P25">We found that the MTS-R6G pre-treatment of cells producing wildtype AcrAB-TolC or carrying an empty vector did not affect the Hoechst accumulation, suggesting that the two intrinsic Cys residues of AcrB located in the transmembrane domain of the protein do not affect the outcome of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We next compared Hoechst accumulation levels in the cells producing different AcrA(Cys) variants and with and without pre-treatment with MTS-R6G. All pumps assembled with AcrA(Cys) variants were as efficient in efflux of Hoechst as the wildtype pump, which is consistent with their ability to protect Δ9-Pore cells from novobiocin, erythromycin and SDS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S2</xref>). The exception is AcrA(Leu50Cys) which appeared to be fully functional in MIC measurement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S2</xref>) but was only partially efficient in efflux of Hoechst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The pre-treatment with MTS-R6G inhibited the activity of AcrA Leu50Cys, Thr205Cys and Asn232Cys variants only, whereas no significant inhibition was seen for other analyzed AcrA(Cys) variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S14</xref>). Hence, only these Cys residues of AcrA are vulnerable to MTS-R6G binding and inhibition, whereas other Cys residues are either inaccessible in the AcrAB-TolC complex or binding of MTS in these sites does not affect the function of the complex. None of these residues are implicated in the characterised AcrA:AcrB binding sites, so the inhibitory effect on efflux is not due to perturbed interactions in the assembly of AcrAB-TolC but the reduction in AcrA conformational flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup></p><p id="P27">T205 is in site IV, the proposed binding site of NSC 60339, and further evidences this area is a druggable site for AcrA inhibition. Interestingly, two other residues were mutated in site IV, yet had no effect on efflux (R183 and D284); these residues reside on the periphery of site IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), and likely do not have as pronounced an effect on the flexibility of AcrA as T205, which in the core of the cleft. Furthermore, T205 showed significant protection in the presence of NSC 60339 in both AcrA constructs, highlighting its importance for AcrA flexibility.</p><p id="P28">The two other residues that had an inhibitory effect on efflux are located away from site IV, at the flexible linker between the αβ-MP domains. N232C and L50C are both located at the bottom of this region and orientated in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The other residues that had no effect on efflux were positioned above N232 and L50 and orientated in the opposite direction. Interestingly, both positions were also found in significantly protected peptides in the presence of NSC 60339 across our HDX-MS experiments. This suggests NSC 60339 is stabilising this area downstream from its binding site. Therefore, restricting the flexibility of this region clearly affects the ability of AcrA in the efflux process, and thus reveals another potential druggable site on AcrA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">In summary, our data supports that NSC 60339 positions itself in the cleft between the lipoyl and αβ domains (site IV) and causes long-range restriction in backbone dynamics of AcrA across all four of its domains. This behaviour was observed in both monomer and pseudo-dimer constructs. We propose the NSC 60339 acts as a molecular wedge within this cleft, significantly restricting the structural dynamics of AcrA, which could have implications for the conformational transitions required during the functional rotation of the AcrAB-TolC pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). A recent study of the assembled AcrAB-TolC efflux pump <italic>in situ</italic> confirms that one of the AcrA protomers in the AcrA dimer is anchored to the inner membrane and interacts with AcrB, whilst also stretching to interact with the peptidoglycan layer and TolC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> The N-terminal region of the second protomer is suggested to interact with the AcrB PC2 subdomain, which undergoes extensive conformational changes throughout the rotational mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> This architecture could allow AcrA to communicate conformational changes in AcrB, to TolC, as it cycles through the rotational mechanism, resulting in TolC transitioning to the ‘open’ state. Thus, NSC 60339 inhibition may result in AcrA losing its ability to accommodate changes across the periplasm and communicate the conformational changes of AcrB to TolC, required for efflux. This could affect the pump in several ways; 1) The interaction of AcrA with AcrB and TolC may become disrupted as AcrA becomes more rigid, 2) AcrA may not be able to maintain a sealed channel during functional rotation, and 3) TolC may not be ‘opened’ as efficiently.</p><p id="P30">Recent work has identified AcrA as a necrosignal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Dead cells release AcrA, which binds to TolC in the outer membrane of live cells to send a signal, increasing drug efflux and the expression of other pumps. It has been shown that NSC 60339 can inhibit both efflux and necrosignalling in AcrA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, whilst novobiocin does not inhibit efflux, as its primary target in bacteria is DNA Gyrase, it can also inhibit necrosignalling, albeit not to the same degree as NSC 60339.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> It is proposed that AcrA interacts with TolC via its α helical hairpin contacting the TolC pore. Our data shows that a global stabilisation of AcrA by NSC 60339 may explain its necrosignalling inhibition ability, possibly by reducing its ability to bind to TolC on the outside of cells. However, novobiocin has also been shown to inhibit necrosignalling in AcrA, and we did not observe a significant effect of its binding on AcrA structural dynamics. Therefore, novobiocin may inhibit necrosignalling in a different fashion, or the structural dynamics may only form part of AcrA’s necrosignalling ability. The necrosignal function of AcrA has only recently been discovered and, therefore, further investigations into the mechanisms of necrosignalling are required to understand this ability, and how best to inhibit it to combat bacterial multidrug resistance generation via this process.</p><p id="P31">Overall, in this work we propose a mechanism of action for the first AcrA inhibitor discovered. This provides a novel model in targeting the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, providing a platform to understand and develop next generation of EPIs. AcrA has been seen to exhibit interchangeability with other PAPs in non-cognate systems, highlighting its flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> Therefore, uncovering the structural dynamics of AcrA is essential to understanding its role as a flexible PAP within an array of assembled multidrug efflux complexes. More generally, we show how HDX-MS can be used in combination with MD simulations, high-resolution structural information and microbiology assays to understand these dynamics and to determine the molecular mechanisms of inhibition, as previously seen with AcrB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification</title><sec id="S10"><title>AcrA<sup>S</sup></title><p id="P32">AcrA<sup>S</sup> lacking the signal peptide residues 1-24, and the site of palmitoylation Cys25, was cloned in a pET28a plasmid with a 6xHis and LE linker (all primers used for cloning can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> AcrA<sup>S</sup> is purified from the cytoplasmic fraction as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Briefly, pET28a containing AcrA<sup>S</sup> was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> C43(DE3) <italic>ΔacrAB</italic> cells. 7 ml of an overnight LB culture was added to 1 L of pre warmed LB culture (x6) containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C until an OD of 0.6 was reached.
