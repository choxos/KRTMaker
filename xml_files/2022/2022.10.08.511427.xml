In current nanopore technologies, stochastic processes influence both the selection of the translocating molecule, translocation rate and translocation velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. As a result, single-molecule translocations are difficult to control spatially and temporally. Here we present a novel method where we engineer precise spatial and temporal control into the single-molecule experiment. We use a glass nanopore mounted on a 3D nanopositioner to spatially select molecules, deterministically tethered on a glass surface, for controlled translocations. By controlling the distance between the nanopore and the glass surface, we can actively select the region of interest on the molecule and scan it a controlled number of times and at controlled velocity. Decreasing the velocity and averaging thousands of consecutive readings of the same molecule increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by two orders of magnitude compared to free translocations. We applied our method to various DNA constructs, achieving down to single nucleotide gap resolution. The spatial multiplexing combined with the sub-nanometer resolution could be used in conjunction with micro-array technologies to enable screening of DNA, improving point of care devices, or enabling high-density, addressable DNA data storage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Biological nanopores have been used to successfully sequence single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which is made possible by slowing the speed of the translocation with protein motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the stochastic nature of which molecule enters the pore at which time, as well as the residual fluctuation in the feed rate of the protein motor remains challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Solid-state nanopores have been engineered to attempt the same molecular detectability of biological nanopores while keeping full control of the pore design and properties in a stable system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Pores can be tuned to the desired size for the molecules in question, enabling the detection and characterization of a broad range of biomolecules such as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), proteins and DNA-protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, speed control with molecular motors has not yet been demonstrated with solid-state nanopores. Even though the conductance drop in solid-state nanopores can be higher than in biological nanopores, the uncontrolled translocation speed hampers the potentially higher SNR. Therefore, the free translocation speed limits high fidelity measurements, making single base pair resolution along freely translocating dsDNA impossible to achieve.</p><p id="P4">Uncontrolled velocity limits the temporal and spatial resolution due to a finite amplifier bandwidth and the noise density integrated over the measurement bandwidth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This limitation decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is critical for detecting small features along the DNA nanostructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. High translocation speeds and low SNR on single readings have this far hampered the use of solid-state devices in the study of complex forms of dsDNA.</p><p id="P5">Nanocapillaries, referred to as glass nanopores, are well suited for the detection of DNA structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> since they have good SNR characteristics for high-bandwidth measurements. Glass nanopores can be manufactured to radii below 10 nm by precisely controlling the diameter of the opening with an electron beam irradiation or by depositing the additional coatings by controllable wet-chemical silanization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. They can also be integrated with other techniques, such as optical detection and optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The latter allows probing force during translocation but the very high force resolution requires low stiffness of the optical trap and prevents sub-nanometer displacement control.</p><p id="P6">Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) on the other hand, has very high accuracy displacement control combined with high-bandwidth, low noise current sensing. SICM uses a glass nanopore as a probe to image biological surfaces by moving the nanocapillary with nanometer precision towards a surface while measuring the current to detect the sample topography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This microscopy method reveals the dynamics of nanostructures on the cell membrane and can be combined with super-resolution fluorescence techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Here we utilize the benefits of SICM to overcome the limitations of uncontrolled translocation of DNA through glass nanopores by combining the high SNR and high bandwidth of the glass nanopores with the high degree of displacement control of SICM to achieve accurate, repeated control of single-molecule translocation experiments.</p><p id="P7">We modified our previously developed HS-SICM setup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> with the addition of a closed loop, long range XYZ piezo scanner to accurately control the pipette motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Analogously to single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> performed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), with SICM we can perform current spectroscopy curves on single molecules. We, therefore, refer to our measurements as scanning ion conductance spectroscopy (SICS). In the first step, the pipette is approached within 0.2-1 μm to the surface. The electrophoretic force captures the DNA when the probe approaches the free-end of a tethered molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-1</xref>). Due to the molecule entering the pore, the conductance through the glass nanopore drops. Then, the glass nanopore is moved up with sub-nanometer precision by the closed-loop piezo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-2</xref>). The measured conductance through the nanopore can then be plotted as a function of distance along the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-3</xref>), until the molecule is pulled out completely from the nanopore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-4</xref>), see conductance plot in red below the method schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>. After this, we can go to a different molecule at a different XY position or scan the same molecule again. We can even stop before reaching step 4, and measure the same region of the molecule multiple times without removing the molecule from the pore. As a proof-of-concept, we performed SICS mapping of 10 × 10 curves over a 40 × 40 μm<sup>2</sup> area detecting dCas9 binding specificity along the DNA contour length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 1</xref>). Using a glass coverslip as a substrate to tether, the single-molecules permits concomitant single-molecule fluorescence measurements in which we labeled dCas9 proteins with Alexa Fluor™ 647 dye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The key difference between our technique and traditional nanopore experiments is how the translocation speed is controlled. In conventional nanopore experiments, the speed of the translocation is determined by the electrophoretic force and the viscous drag of the molecules in the solution and the pore. The speed of translocation depends on many factors, such as ionic strength, molecular charge, bias voltage, and nanopore geometry. The result is a stochastic nature of the translocation. This manifests itself in non-uniform dwell-time distribution between the detection of equally spaced motifs on a molecule such as a DNA ruler, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref> (free-translocation) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 3 and 4</xref>. Free translocations generate conductance signals as a function of time with non-uniform translocation velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to stochastic effects influencing the translocation speed, also the selection of which molecules are translocated is governed by stochastic factors.</p><p id="P9">In SICS, however, the molecule of interest is tethered to the surface and the electrophoretic force is countered by a reaction force on the tether, which prevents the molecule from fully translocating. Translocation is solely governed by the motion of the glass nanopore, which can be controlled accurately during the experiment. With the ability to deterministically control the velocity, the conductance traces are now a function of distance instead of time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref> (controlled translocation) shows the equidistant motif on the DNA ruler. This decouples important experimental parameters (ionic strength, bias voltage) as well as uncontrollable factors (such as nanopore geometry) from the translocation speed and detection bandwidth. We can, therefore, independently optimize experimental parameters to improve the detection limit.</p><p id="P10">In order to assess the benefits of SICS we used DNA rulers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to characterize the effect of translocation velocity on SNR, precision and repeatability. This DNA ruler is composed of a 7’228 base pair DNA strand (2’458 nm) and 6 markers of DNA dumbbell hairpins which are positioned at 1’032 base pairs intervals along the DNA contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the conductance-distance curve generated by SICS, revealing 6 markers. Controlled translocation with SICS allows decreasing the speed by more than 4 orders of magnitude compared with typical free translocations, leading to an increased SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). At the lowest velocity of 0.1 μm/s, the SNR measured was 152 ± 33 with an 8 nm glass nanopore radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This corresponds to an order of magnitude improvement of SNR compared with a free-translocation (&gt;100 μm/s velocity). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> shows a location precision of 1% with controlled translocations, compared with 30% in free translocations with glass nanopores of the same pore size. SICS inherently has lateral control and can map out diverse molecules tethered on the surface or scan the same molecule again. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref> shows the overlay of 100 distinct molecules of the DNA ruler and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref> shows 100 readings of the same selected molecule. This spatial addressability allows us to multiplex the measurements to multiple molecular species.</p><p id="P11">To take advantage of our SICS platform in terms of spatial addressability, multiplexing and resolution assessment, we engineered dsDNA that contained single-stranded regions (“DNA gaps”) of various sizes. We custom-designed four different DNA constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 5</xref>) that were 8’750 base pairs in length (2’975 nm) and presented DNA gaps of 80, 40, 20, or 12 nucleotides, corresponding to lengths of 27.2, 13.6, 6.8, and 4.1 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). As a proof-of-principle for spatially multiplexed single molecules, we spotted the four different DNA gap constructs in a 2×2 array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Within a single experiment, using one and the same glass nanopore, we detected and discriminated the four different DNA molecules. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> shows distinct conductance amplitudes (ΔGgap) for the different 80, 40, 20, and 12 nucleotides (nt) gaps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref> shows that the measured conductance amplitude of the 80 nt gap (ΔGgap) was half of the dsDNA conductance drop (ΔGdsDNA), as expected. For smaller gap sizes, the measured ΔGgap decreases due to convolution effects. To obtain reliable measurements on the smaller gaps, multiple measurements are desirable.</p><p id="P12">We use the sub-molecular spatial addressability (position the glass nanopore along the single molecule) to scan the same molecular region multiple times, with tunable bias and bi-directional readings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 6 and 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref> shows the probability density map of 1000 readings on the same feature (80 nt DNA gap). By recording and averaging conductance-distance curves of the same feature we decreased the RMS noise of the averaged signal from 11.2 pS to 0.4 pS, increasing the SNR 20 times compared with a single reading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, multiple reads of the same feature decreased the error of the measurement, and obtained an average amplitude of 157.3 pS with a standard error of 0.05 pS (0.03 % error), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 8</xref>. Thus, our method yielded an SNR of 394 on the DNA gap, which corresponds to an improvement of two orders of magnitude compared to free translocations. By accessing specific regions of the DNA molecule and by averaging the conductance fingerprints, we reliably detected gaps as small as 12 nucleotides (4.1 nm) with high SNR for several pipette radii below 10 nm, hinting at an ultimate resolution capability down to single nucleotide gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To have finer control over the gap size, we created a library of oligonucleotides complementary to the DNA gaps (gap adaptors shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 1</xref>). As a proof-of-concept, we hybridized 79 nt single-stranded DNA (oligonucleotide) to complementary 80 nt DNA gap molecules (DNA gap template) and then spotted next to the non-hybridized 80 nt DNA gap template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Within a single experiment and the same glass nanopore, we compared controlled translocations on the 80 nt gap template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> - Top) and the 1 nt gap in the hybridized complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> - Bottom). Our results clearly demonstrate the single nt gap resolution of SICS, with an average gap amplitude detected of 31.2 pS for a glass nanopore of 7 nm radius. Furthermore, the hybridization does not have to happen before spotting but rather in situ after spotting the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). We demonstrated in-situ hybridization of 19 nt oligo strand with a complementary 20 nt gap, and the subsequent successful detection of the single nucleotide gap with an average gap amplitude detected of 16.9 pS for a glass nanopore of 8 nm radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). This indicates potential applications in diagnostics, DNA data storage and data retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">We achieved full control of the translocation speed providing precise spatial and temporal control of the single-molecule experiments. This allows reading the same molecule, or region of a molecule, thousands of times, as well as scanning an array of different types of molecules. This control is independent of experimental parameters (ionic strength, bias voltage) as well as uncontrollable factors (such as nanopore geometry) and it allows for independent optimization of experimental parameters to improve the detection limit, unlocking the use of nanopore sensing in applications that previously required sub-nanometer resolution. For the first time, it was possible to reproducibly scan selected areas of a molecule, thereby addressing specific molecular regions of interest with unprecedented resolution and throughput. We achieved 100’000 readings per experiment and a scanning rate of 4 readings/s. The ability to perform experiments with different molecular species within one experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), drastically increases the experimental throughput and permits accurate comparison of the results given the identical experimental conditions (same glass nanopore, velocities, and buffer conditions). Besides enabling more detailed biophysical studies, this addressability enables new conceptual approaches to multiplexed diagnostics (multiple analytes on one DNA template), or DNA data storage, where the sample area could be spatially divided into sectors and folders, with the data stored in individual molecules acting as files.</p><p id="P15">Currently, we used glass capillaries shrunken down with SEM to nanopore size. Fabricating these glass nanopores in a reproducible way remains a challenging task. It offers, however, the possibility to tune the nanopore size depending on the application. Whereas we preferred smaller nanopores for our DNA template-based (DNA rulers, DNA gaps) experiments, DNA/protein complexes often require bigger pores. The conical shape of the glass nanopores intrinsically limits the axial resolution of our measurements. Nevertheless, through the drastic increase of SNR we were able to detect down to single nucleotide gaps in dsDNA. Additionally, SICS measurements could benefit from the fact that our SICS setup is integrated with a state-of-the-art optical microscope, enabling Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and DNA-PAINT (DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> experiments.</p><p id="P16">Compared to other nanopore detection techniques, glass nanopores are more difficult to parallelize. This drawback, however, is partially mitigated by the ability to do spatial multiplexing, meaning that one glass nanopore could probe thousands of molecules arranged in a microarray. The basis of SICS, being the mechanical control of the translocation, could potentially also be realized using solid state nanopores in MEMS devices.</p><p id="P17">Integration of biological nanopores into the opening of the glass capillary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> could combine the benefits of biological nanopores (high resolution and reproducibility) with the benefits of SICS (molecule independent speed control and multiple readings per molecule). We expect this to greatly enhance the suitability of nanopores for the sequencing of peptides and proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental setup</title><sec id="S4"><title>SICS system and controlled translocation measurements</title><p id="P18">The SICS system is based on a high-speed scanning ion conductance microscope (HS-SICM) that we developed recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">1</xref></sup>. We modified our HS-SICM with the addition of a closed loop, long-range XYZ piezo scanner to precisely control the pipette motion and perform mapping curves in a similar way as done in AFM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">2</xref></sup>. This enabled us to spatially select single molecules to translocate them at a controlled speed. In order to capture selected molecules, a bias is applied between two Ag/AgCl electrodes across the glass nanopore used in our system. When a positive bias is applied on the negatively charged DNA molecule tethered on the glass surface, the resulting force will pull the molecule through the nanopore, until the molecule is stretched between the surface and the nanopore. By moving the nanopore with respect to the surface, the conductance signature of the molecule inside the nanopore can be measured as a function of distance along the molecule, detecting specific features on the single molecule. The 3D nanopositioner used to translocate the molecules through the nanopore is a piezo-nanopositioning stage with 10 μm Z travel range and 100 μm X-Y travel range (P-733 Piezo NanoPositioner, Physik Instrumente), driven by a low-voltage piezo amplifier (E-500 Piezo Controller System, Physik Instrumente). The 3D nanopositioner was assembled in a custom-built micro translation stage, mounted atop an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope body. Thus, the SICS system enabled correlative fluorescence microscopy with a four-color (405 nm, 488 nm 561 nm, 647 nm) pigtailed Monolithic Laser Combiner (400B, Agilent Technologies), controlled by a custom-written LabVIEW software. An integrated sCMOS camera (Photometrics, Prime 95B) and Micromanager software were used to acquire images. The controlled translocation current signal was amplified by a transimpedance amplifier NF-SA-605F2 (100 MΩ gain, NF corporation) with a bandwidth of 10 kHz. The SICS controller was implemented in LabVIEW on a NI USB-7856R OEM R Series (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), to perform high-precision conductance-distance measurements and spatial mapping (conductance-volume mapping), similar to AFM force volume mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">3</xref></sup>. The controlled translocation signal was acquired at 1 MHz sampling rate.

Immediately after, the nanocapillaries were immersed in a 400 mM or 1000 mM KCl solution and placed inside the desiccator connected to a vacuum pump. Nanocapillaries were kept under low-pressure (1-10 mbar) for 10 min to pre-fill them and avoid the formation of air bubbles in the thick end of the capillaries. Then they were imaged with an inverted brightfield microscope to confirm pre-filling. After, the nanocapillaries were placed inside a microwave oven (MW 1766 EASY WAVE, P = 700 W, λ=12.23 cm). The highest power setting was always used. Microwave radiation was applied in heating cycles to heat the solution until its boiling point. The heating duration varied based on the volume and temperature of the solution.

The reaction mixture was purified using PCR and a Gel Cleanup kit (Qiagen) from the agarose gel according to the protocol from the manufacturer. The length of the 10 kb λ-DNA product was verified with an agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration was measured with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrometer.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>gRNA preparation and immobilization</title><p id="P23">10kb long λ-DNA was screened for the presence of PAM motifs 5’X20NGG3’ and two targets separated by 5374 bp were selected. Single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to be complementary to the 2 adjacent 20 bp PAM motifs previously selected on the λ-DNA. gRNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription of dsDNA templates carrying a T7 promoter sequence. Transcription templates were generated by PCR amplification of ssDNA templates containing the T7 binding site, 20 bp sequence complementary to the DNA target site, and sgRNA scaffold sequence using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The gRNAs were synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s conditions. The gRNAs were treated with Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher) and MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used for purification according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The concentration of purified gRNAs was measured with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrometer and the length and quality of the sgRNA were estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. sgRNA samples were kept at -20 °C for a maximum time of 48h until further use.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>dCas9-DNA complex formation</title><p id="P24">A commercially available inactive mutant of Cas9 nuclease (dCas9) with N-terminal SNAP-tag (EnGen Spy dCas9 ) was acquired from New England Biolabs. The protein was labeled with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647 labeling kit (New England Biolabs) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The unreacted substrate was removed by the size exclusion column. Finally, fluorescently labeled dCas9 was incubated with gRNA in 1 × NEBuffer 3.1 (New England Biolabs). 1 nM dCas9 was incubated with 10 nM gRNA for 30 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. 0.5 units of RNase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher) were used to prevent the degradation of RNA. After incubation, DNA was added at the final concentration of 50 pM and the mixture was further kept for 30 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. Schematics of the final constructs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 1</xref> and dCas9-DNA binding controls were performed with AFM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>DNA ruler construct</title><p id="P25">DNA ruler constructs were prepared in the group of Prof. Ulrich F. Keyser, using a well-established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">8</xref></sup>. The DNA ruler was synthesized by cutting circular 7249 base M13mp18 ssDNA (New England Biolabs) using the enzymes EcoRI and BamHI to form a linear ssDNA chain 7228 bases in length. The final scaffold was then purified and mixed in a 1:5 ratio with 212 oligonucleotides that formed a double-strand with six equidistant zones of dumbbell hairpins. The mixture is then annealed and purified. The final construct contains 6 markers with 8 dumbbells each. Markers are equally positioned in intervals of 1032 bp (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>DNA gap construct</title><p id="P26">DNA gap constructs were prepared in the group of Prof. Dr. Alexandre Kuhn. DNA gap constructs were generated using modified 9 kb plasmids. In short, the pPIC9K plasmid (Invitrogen) was mutated using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis (New England BioLabs) to insert two restriction sites specific for the nicking endonuclease Nt.BbvCI (New England BioLabs). Four plasmids were engineered with restriction cut sites that were 80, 40, 20, or 12 nt apart and that flanked an EcoRV restriction site. To generate a specific DNA gap fragment, the corresponding purified plasmid was first linearized by restriction digestion and biotin-labeled using Biotin-11-dUTP (ThermoFisher) and Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs). The DNA fragments were then digested with Nt.BbvCI to obtain single-strand breaks (nicks) and gapped by repeated (3x) heating cycles (90 °C, 60 sec; 60 °C, 10 min; 37 °C, 20 min) in the presence of a single-stranded competitor oligonucleotide (i.e. complementary to the DNA sequence comprised between the nicks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">9</xref></sup>. Finally, the construct was digested with EcoRV to eliminate ungapped fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">10</xref></sup> analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel and purified (Monarch DNA gel extraction kit, New England BioLabs). The final dsDNA constructs were 8’750 base pairs long with biotin attached on one end, and a gap of 80, 40, 20, or 12 nucleotides (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 5</xref>). The sequence of the single-stranded stretches in the gap constructs were: 80 nt: GGTAAATTTCACGTTTAAAATCAGCGTACCTTTTTCTCGATATCGCATCTCCGCAAATTTCTCTAAAACAAGATAGCTGA; 40 nt: GGGCGTACCTTTTTCTCGATATCGCATCTCCGCAAGCTGA; 20 nt: GGTTCTCGATATCGCGCTGA; 12 nt: GGATATCGCTGA. Occasionally we observed hairpins during SICS experiments in samples measured right after incubation at 4° C (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Oligonucleotide-DNA gap template construct</title><p id="P27">In order to create gaps of shorter length, we created a library of complementary DNA oligos of different lengths that were hybridized on already existing dsDNA with a gap (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 1</xref>). In this way, we got gaps of smaller sizes that can be found in the table. We hybridized them by mixing the ~9 kb dsDNA gap templates (20, 40, 80) with the oligo (termed gap adaptor) at a 1:100 ratio, and placing it in a thermocycler with the following program: the sample was heated at 70 °C for 5 min and afterward ramped down 1 °C for 1 min per cycle, over 60 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Imaging chambers for DNA immobilization</title><p id="P28">The imaging chambers that are compatible with single-molecule fluorescence and single-molecule scanning ion conductance microscopy imaging were fabricated from high precision No. 1.5 borosilicate 25 mm coverslips (Marienfeld). Coverslips were cleaned with ethanol, then MiliQ water, dried with nitrogen flow, and cleaned with oxygen plasma (Femto A, Diener electronic GmbH) at maximum power for 660 s. After cleaning the open circular chamber made from a 1 mL pipette tip was glued on top with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), forming the final assembly. Fabricated chambers were kept in sealed petri-dishes until further use. For multiplexing, we made four small chambers (each of 5 μl volume) located on the same coverslip (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the same way, adopting the robotic spotting methodology used in the preparation of microarrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">11</xref></sup>, on a single 25 mm coverslip, one could accommodate more than 400 000 samples in the same buffer conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Surface immobilization</title><p id="P29">100 μL of 1 mg/ml of BSA-Bt (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS was incubated for at least 1 h in plasma-cleaned chambers to achieve the full glass surface coverage. Samples then were washed 10× with PBS by exchanging half of the solution, but without drying a surface. Samples then were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml of streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, followed by a 10× wash with PBS. Finally, 10-100 pM of DNA molecules were incubated for 1 h, followed by 10× wash with PBS or 3.1 NEBuffer. Samples were kept at 4 °C until use. The solution in the imaging chambers was exchanged by performing an additional 10× wash before imaging. The final imaging solutions are described in the imaging and SICS sections. We noticed that samples have not shown signs of degradation even after one year if kept at 4 °C in sealed petri-dishes that eliminates water evaporation.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Single-molecule fluorescence imaging</title><p id="P30">To optimize the surface density of DNA and to perform a control of dCas9 binding, samples were first imaged with a single molecule fluorescence microscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">12</xref></sup> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 11</xref>). For single-molecule imaging and to prevent photobleaching, a reductive/oxidative system (ROXS) based on glucose oxidase and catalase was used. Final buffer composition consisted of 2 mM TROLOX, 40 mM TRIS, 400 mM KCl, 1 % of glucose, 120 units/ml of glucose catalase, 15 units/ml. Buffer was filtered with a 200 nm filter. Imaging was performed in a sealed chamber to avoid oxygen exposure.
