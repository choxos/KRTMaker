Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron’s spiking responses and shapes the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models for predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depended on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and perform best for different temporal regimes of these interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Sensory systems dynamically encode stimuli with a wide range of temporal characteristics, reflecting the complexity of changing scenes and self-motion in the natural world. A crucial mechanism for shaping and supporting the encoding of dynamic stimuli is thought to lie in the interplay of excitation and suppression, with the latter encompassing inhibitory synaptic signals as well as cell-intrinsic negative feedback, such as mediated by voltage-dependent conductances. A simple example of this interplay of excitation and suppression is the shortening of response duration, leading to markedly transient responses of cells in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, the thalamic lateral-geniculate nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, as well as in auditory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and somatosensory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> systems in response to an abrupt change in the strength of a stimulus. In many cases, this response transiency has been explained by suppressive inputs coming with a short delay relative to the excitatory input, resulting in a brief window of opportunity for elevated activity before suppression dominates.</p><p id="P4">Similarly, the context dependence of stimulus encoding in the visual system, such as found by varying background illumination, contrast, stimulus size, or stimulus motion, has been captured by suppressive interactions that can act as a divisive gain modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Suppressive mechanisms may also allow for creating dynamic variations of stimulus integration time, as demonstrated by a conductance-based encoding model of suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This provides a long temporal window for integrating sensory inputs when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, allowing a neuron to average out noise and generate a robust response. A short integration window at higher signal-to-noise ratio, on the other hand, enables the neuron to lock its response to the fast fluctuation of the sensory input.</p><p id="P5">To understand the role of the excitation–suppression interplay in generating various response dynamics, several filter-based encoding models have been proposed. The canonical idea behind these groups of models is to capture properties of excitatory and suppressive signals in independent temporal filters, whose signals are then combined to yield the activity of the modeled neuron. Here we focus on three classes of these models that have been proposed to capture the temporal response properties of retinal ganglion cell responses, using subtractive inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, divisive suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and activity-dependent negative feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, respectively. For the subtractive and divisive models, the suppression is derived in a feedforward way by applying a filter to the same input signal that feeds the excitation. For the feedback model, on the other hand, suppression is triggered by the spikes that are stochastically generated by the model cell and that provide the input to the suppressive filter.</p><p id="P6">To maximize the similarity between the training algorithms and optimization constraints across the different models, we trained and tested the three suppressive models as well as a feedforward linear-nonlinear (LN) model within a unified computational structure, where each of the models could be implemented by fixing certain model parameters to specific values. We applied this framework to ganglion cell responses recorded from isolated retinas of axolotl, mouse, and common marmoset under stimulation with full-field white-noise flicker of light intensity. The unified implementation and datasets allowed us to compare the models directly and to identify the cell and stimulus types for which each model outperforms the others.</p><p id="P7">One of the main challenges for developing encoding models is their generalization to different classes of stimuli. While we train the models on data from white-noise stimuli, as is customarily done for these and comparable models, we here also test the performance of the suppressive models on stimuli that contain sinusoidal frequency and contrast sweeps. The ability of a model to generalize to such non-stationary stimuli helps provide an understanding of how the model captures retinal stimulus processing in a complex setting with varying stimulus statistics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparison of three suppression models in a unified framework</title><p id="P8">We implemented three filter-based neuron models of suppression, based on subtractive, divisive, and feedback interactions, respectively, as well as an LN model in a unified structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>; see <xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The common structure aimed at maximizing similarities in the models’ motifs as well as in training and testing procedures. In this framework, each model yields an integrated signal that encompasses the effects of excitation and suppression and that—after nonlinear rectification—is used for the stochastic generation of time-varying spike counts in small discrete time windows via a Poisson process. What differs between the models is how the integrated signal is obtained (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The subtractive and divisive models both had two upstream branches, each with its own stimulus filter and subsequent nonlinear transformation. The two branches were then combined by a subtractive or divisive operation, respectively. The upstream filters were unconstrained, whereas the shapes of the nonlinear transformations were restricted to support the excitatory or suppressive action: The nonlinearities for the excitatory and suppressive branches of the subtractive model as well as for the excitatory branch of the divisive model were required to be monotonically increasing, whereas the suppressive branch of the divisive model had a nonlinearity that was “bump-shaped”, i.e., monotonically increasing on the side of negative inputs and monotonically decreasing on the positive side. The feedback model and the LN model each had a single (excitatory) upstream branch for stimulus filtering and subsequent nonlinear transformation of the filtered signal. For the feedback model, an additional filter was applied to the model-generated spikes, and the upstream and feedback filter signals were then summed.</p><p id="P9">The final output nonlinearity just prior to the stochastic spike generation is a common element in all models. For the LN model, this means two successive nonlinear stages that together constitute the typical single output nonlinearity of this model. That this is here subdivided into two stages is a concession to the unified structure of all models. We checked that the two-stage nonlinearity did not impair model performance by comparing this LN model to a more conventional LN model where the filter was obtained either as the spike-triggered average or as the first stimulus feature from a spike-triggered-covariance analysis (selecting from these two options the one that performed better). The nonlinearity was here obtained as a histogram of the measured spike probability depending on the filtered stimulus signal. We found that the LN model that was fitted via the unified structure of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, including the two-stage nonlinearity, slightly outperformed the classical LN model implementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), presumably because the regularization included in the model fit supports model performance for held-out data. For all further comparison, we there used the fitted LN model, according to the structure of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>.</p><p id="P10">To limit the number of free parameters, the models, the filters, and the upstream nonlinearities were parametrized using sets of basis-functions, and the output rectifier was a parametrized softplus function (see <xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). All models were trained using a maximum-likelihood approach with a block-coordinate ascent algorithm, in which we iterated the sequential update of each block of the model (a filter or a nonlinearity) to maximize the likelihood function while keeping other blocks constant.</p><p id="P11">The models were trained and tested on ganglion cell spiking activity in retinas of axolotls (n = 15 recordings), mice (n = 8), and marmosets (n = 10). Spikes were recorded with multi-electrode arrays while the retinas were stimulated with full-field illumination. For model fitting, we applied light intensity that varied according to Gaussian white noise. For axolotl and mouse, the stimulus consisted of an alternating sequence of non-repeating white noise, which was used for training the models, and “frozen noise”, i.e., a fixed white-noise segment that was presented repeatedly, which we held out for testing (see <xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). In the marmoset data, no frozen-noise stimulus was used. Therefore, we segmented the data into pseudo-trials of 33.3 s duration and used one fifth of each trial as held-out test data and trained the models on the rest. The model performance was assessed by calculating the average information per spike provided by the model about the cell’s spiking response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, assessed on the held-out test data segments. Note that this measure of model performance does not require repeated trials.</p><p id="P12">Our analysis included 607 axolotl, 335 mouse, and 370 marmoset cells that responded reliably to the white-noise stimulation. ON-OFF cells, i.e., cells that responded to both step-wise increases and decreases in light intensity, were removed (see <xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) because their responses cannot be captured by the monotonically increasing excitatory nonlinearities, as applied in all four models.</p><p id="P13">Comparing the performance of the three suppressive models to that of the LN model (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) showed that each of the suppressive models predicted responses on held-out data better than the LN model for the majority of cells (subtractive: 97% of the cells, divisive: 96%, feedback: 85%). To quantify for each cell and each suppressive model how much predictive power was gained by the addition of the considered suppressive component, we computed the excess performance as the difference (in bits/spike) between the model performance of the considered suppressive model and that of the LN model (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We found that, for 95% of the cells with the highest excess performance within each species, the excess performance of the best-performing suppressive model was in the range of [0.03, 0.94] bits/spike for axolotl, [0.01, 0.29] for mouse, and [0.001, 0.23] for marmoset. The best-performing model was the subtractive model for 46%, the divisive model for 42%, and the feedback model for 12% of the cells.</p><p id="P14">For recordings from axolotl and mouse retina, visual stimulation included repeatedly inserted sections of the same (randomly generated) stimulus sequence (“frozen noise”). These sections, which were not used for parameter fitting, allow measuring a firing-rate profile. Comparison with model-predicted firing rates then provided a measure of explained variance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). This yielded qualitatively similar findings as the evaluation via per-spike information (cf. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). In particular, the explained variance was generally higher for all suppressive models than for the LN model (p &lt;&lt; 0.001). Moreover, the excess performance, as obtained here by subtracting the explained variance of the LN model from that of the considered suppressive model, was generally larger for the subtractive and the divisive models as compared to the feedback model, corroborating that the subtractive and divisive models on average outperformed the feedback model.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell-type specific comparison of subtractive and divisive model</title><p id="P15">As the subtractive and divisive models generally had the top performance among the four assessed models, we compared these two models more closely and aimed at determining for which cells one or the other of these two models was superior. Comparing the performances on a cell-by-cell basis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) indicated that, in the axolotl retina, there is a group of cells for which the subtractive model outperformed the divisive model. For the rest of the axolotl cells as well as for mouse and marmoset cells, the performances of the two models were comparable. For mouse and marmoset, the divisive model performed overall slightly better than the subtractive cells (p &lt; 0.003 in both cases; here and in later comparisons between models: Wilcoxon signed rank test with false discovery rate for multiple comparison correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For the axolotl retina, we aimed at understanding the diversity in model performance by classifying the cells into ON- and OFF-type classes as well as into slow and fast. To do so, we computed the temporal filter for each cell as the spike-triggered average under the temporal white-noise stimulation and clustered cells in the space of the first two principal components of all filters into four clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), which were characterized according to the sign of the primary peak of the filter as ON- or OFF-type and according to the peak latency as fast or slow. Based on this classification, we found that the relative performance of the subtractive and the divisive model depended on the kinetics of the considered cell (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). For fast cells, the difference between the performance of the subtractive and the divisive model was small, with the subtractive model just slightly better for fast OFF cells (mean difference = 0.026 bits/spike, p = 0.005) and no significant difference for the small number of identified fast ON cells (mean difference = 0.02 bits/spike, p = 0.7). For slow ON and slow OFF cells, on the other hand, the subtractive model performed substantially better than the divisive model (slow OFF: mean difference = 0.08 bits/spike, p &lt;&lt; 0.0001, slow ON: mean difference = 0.1 bits/spike, p &lt;&lt; 0.0001).</p><p id="P17">To better understand how the suppressive components of the subtractive and the divisive model help improve over the LN model, we examined the model components for individual sample cells more closely. For the sample axolotl slow OFF cell in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, the subtractive and the divisive model yielded qualitatively similar stimulus filters for both the excitatory and the suppressive model branches. However, the upstream suppressive functions of the subtractive and divisive models were substantially different for this cell. In the subtractive model, the monotonic shape of the nonlinearity in the suppression branch allowed for a gradual decline of suppression as the activation of the suppressive filter becomes more negative (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Ai</xref>). This let the suppression contribute a gradual and nuanced component to the model activation, which supported the accurate prediction of spikes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aii</xref>). In the divisive model, on the other hand, the shape of the nonlinearity in the suppressive branch led to a unilateral, rectified suppression with essentially no sensitivity to filter activations near to or smaller than zero (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Ai</xref>). This follows from the constraint of the nonlinearity to be bump-like so that suppression cannot decrease as the filter activation deviates from zero. Therefore, the divisive model was not as sensitive as the subtractive model to fine fluctuations in the stimulus and often generated stretches of near-flat response predictions, which did not capture the response modulation for this cell (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aii</xref>).</p><p id="P18">By contrast, for the mouse cell shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the axolotl fast OFF cell in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, and the marmoset cell in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, the bump-like shape of the divisive suppression nonlinearity seems more appropriate. Here, the suppressive filter for the divisive model resembled the excitatory filter, except for a small shift to the right. This resulted in a suppressive response that came with a slight delay compared to the excitatory response, leading to a timelier prediction of the falling edge of a firing-rate response peak compared to the LN model. Often, the suppressive filters lagged the associated excitatory filters by 1-2 stimulus frames (∼30-60 ms for axolotl; ∼16-33 ms for mouse and marmoset). This was the case for 57% of the axolotl cells among those for which the divisive model outperformed the others, 79% of mouse cells, and 70% of marmoset cells, as assessed by the peak location in the cross-correlogram between the two filters (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Also, for 57% of the axolotl cells with a superior divisive model, 90% of the mouse cells, and 88% of the marmoset cells, the divisive nonlinearity was fairly symmetric (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>; asymmetry index &lt; 0.5), as measured by the absolute difference in average values of the nonlinearity on the left versus right side of zero (normalized by the corresponding sum). Thus, for these cells, both positive and negative activations of the suppressive filter led to suppression in the model, in contrast to the example of the slow axolotl cell in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>.</p><p id="P19">The subtractive model for the three sample cells shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, on the other hand, yielded a more diverse set of suppressive filters, relative to their excitatory counterparts. The suppressive filter could be temporally trailing the excitatory filter (e.g., <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), preceding it (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), or have an altogether different shape or relative strength in the positive and negative components (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A suppressive filter lagging the excitatory one by 1-2 stimulus frames was found for 40% of the axolotl cells for which the subtractive model outperformed the others, for 12% of mouse cells, and for 5% of marmoset cells. By contrast, 32% of those axolotl cells, 23% of the mouse cells, and 28% of the marmoset cells had suppressive filters leading the excitatory filter by 1-3 stimulus frames (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Yet, model performance was generally similar to the divisive model, suggesting that different computational motives might converge to inherently different, but equally good solutions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Differences in model performance between sustained and transient cells</title><p id="P20">Delayed suppression that comes with a similar stimulus dependence as excitation is a proposed mechanism for generating sharp transient responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The delayed suppression may result, for example, from feedforward inhibition with additional synaptic transmission delays as compared to excitation, which generates a brief window for excitation to elicit spikes before the suppressive component terminates the response.</p><p id="P21">We thus hypothesized that cells with transient response characteristics have particularly strong suppression and that adding a suppressive component in the model is particularly important for these cells. For a subset of marmoset cells, which had also been stimulated using full-field steps in light intensity (100% contrast), we therefore determined the transiency of their responses to light-intensity steps and classified them as either transient or sustained by comparing the strength of the initial response peak to the sustained activity beyond 300 ms after stimulus onset (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then checked for each class of cells how important the addition of a suppressive component in the model was by collecting the excess performance values. As the model performances displayed considerable variability across experiments, most likely at least partly due to different sampling of ganglion cell types and retinal eccentricity, we made this comparison on an experiment-by-experiment basis. Furthermore, we focused on ON-type cells, as some of our recordings did not yield a sufficient number of OFF-type cells for separation into transient and sustained classes.</p><p id="P22">For the sample recording shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, the excess performance of suppression (from the best-performing suppressive model for each cell) was significantly larger for the transient-ON cells compared to the sustained-ON cells, suggesting weaker suppression in the sustained-ON cells (mean difference: 0.032 bits/spike; p = 0.0083). Four out of six recordings showed a similar difference between the transient and sustained-ON cells, whereas there was no substantial difference for two recordings (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This indicates that, indeed, explicit suppressive model components can be particularly helpful for transient cells in explaining response characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Generalization to stimuli with varying contrast and temporal frequency</title><p id="P23">The presented findings so far were mostly based on the performance of the suppressive models on white-noise stimuli. Thus, an important question is how the derived models generalize to stimuli with different, non-stationary statistics, such as variations in contrast or temporal frequency. For a subset of recordings from marmoset cells, we applied a full-field chirp stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which contained two sections of sinusoidal light-intensity modulations, one at 4 Hz with monotonically increasing contrast from 0% to 100% over 8 s (“contrast sweep”) and the other at 100% contrast with increasing frequency from 0 Hz to 15 Hz over 8 s (“frequency sweep”). We used measured firing rates in response to repeated presentations of these two sinusoidal light-intensity modulations to test the performance of the models after training on the white-noise stimulus.</p><p id="P24">As illustrated by the model responses for two sample cells shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-D</xref>, the degree to which the prediction of each model matched a cell’s response varied with the frequency and contrast of the stimulus. For the sample cell shown for the contrast sweep (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), all models captured the response profile at low contrast quite well, displaying rectified response peaks with increasing amplitude for increasing contrast, which matched the recorded activity. For higher contrast, however, most models gave overshooting predictions, with response peaks that were too large and too long in time (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, right). Only the divisive model managed to yield good predictions here, reflecting how the cell’s response events at high contrast were cut off and suppressed after the initial rising phase.</p><p id="P25">We quantified the dependence of model performance on contrast for the contrast sweep stimulus by calculating the explained variance (R<sup>2</sup>) for each model within a sliding window of 150 ms duration, shifted along the time course of the stimulus in steps of 16.7 ms (1 stimulus frame). For the sample cell, the divisive model substantially outperformed the others for any contrast higher than about 20% (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). To quantify the performance across the population of cells, we calculated the performance range for each cell as the range of contrasts for which R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0. Over the population, the performance range was significantly larger for the divisive model, compared to other models (p &lt;&lt; 0.0001 in each case; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that the divisive model generalized over a wider range of contrasts. This finding resonates well with a previous finding in mouse ON-alpha ganglion cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, demonstrating that the divisive model can capture adapting responses under contrast changes in a white-noise stimulus.</p><p id="P26">Similar to the contrast dependence of model performance, we observed that the relative performance of the models depended on temporal frequency. For the sample cell shown for the contrast sweep (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), model predictions under low frequency were often too wide and shallow. Here, the subtractive model managed best to generate fairly sharp responses, approximately matching the time course of the data. For larger temporal stimulus frequencies, on the other hand, all models tended to overestimate the duration of response events (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, right). Yet, similar to the high-contrast scenario in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, the divisive model managed best to cut off some of the response prediction after the initial rising phase and thus yielded slightly more accurate predictions at higher frequencies.</p><p id="P27">We again quantified the frequency dependence of model predictions by computing R<sup>2</sup> within a sliding window, capturing different frequency ranges. As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, the subtractive model outperformed the other models for the sample cell when the frequency of the stimulus was below about 4 Hz, whereas the divisive model had the highest performance among the tested models for higher frequencies. To assess the generality of these findings on the population level, we calculated for each cell the low-frequency performance, i.e., the average explained variance for the first 317 ms of the frequency sweep (corresponding to 10 shifts by one stimulus frame of the 150-ms analysis window) as well as the performance range, i.e., the range of frequencies for which R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0. For the subtractive model, the low-frequency performance was indeed significantly higher than for the other models (p &lt; 0.03 for each comparison; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, left), indicating that this model performed best in capturing the cells’ responses to low frequencies in the chirp stimulus. On the other hand, it was again the divisive model—like for the contrast sweep—that had the largest performance range (p &lt; 0.004 for each comparison; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, right), indicating that this model generalized better over the frequency range of the chirp stimulus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The interplay of excitation and suppression is a central theme for the generation and formation of neuronal responses to sensory stimulation. How to reflect the suppression in computational models of single cells is thus a question of broad interest. By testing models on spike-train data from retinal ganglion cells of three different species, we here found that three previously introduced approaches to incorporate suppression into filter-based models can all be used to improve response predictions over the commonly applied single-filter model, the linear-nonlinear model. Moreover, the subtractive and the divisive model generally outperform the feedback model for most cells in axolotl, mouse, and marmoset.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Comparisons of model performances</title><p id="P29">The fact that the subtractive and the divisive model overall performed quite similarly for most cells might seem a bit disappointing at first glance, as the lack of a clear “winner” makes inference about the type of excitation–suppression interaction difficult. On the other hand, this null-result means that, from a phenomenological perspective, the details of how suppression is included in the model matter much less than having a suppressive component at all, indicating that different interactions can achieve similar functions by different means. The functional equivalence of different model structures is reminiscent of studies of the stomatogastric ganglion in lobster where the potential variable implementations of the same circuit function has been forcefully demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">More detailed comparisons between these two models, however, revealed systematic differences in how performance depended on species and stimulus features. The subtractive model performed better for capturing responses of slow axolotl cells to white-noise stimuli and responses of marmoset cells to low-temporal-frequency parts of the chirp stimulus. The divisive model, on the other hand, displayed greater potential for generalizing over wider ranges of contrast and frequency. This suggests that different neural suppression mechanisms may dominate for different temporal scales of stimulation and response and that the two models differ in how well they capture the effects of these specific mechanisms. In particular, the subtractive model may specifically account for biological mechanisms that prevail in slow cells or that take effect when the stimulus is predominated by slow frequencies.</p><p id="P31">A technical aspect that may contribute to limiting the performance of the feedback model is the fact that suppression in this model depends on the occurrence of spikes, which are sparse and stochastic in the model. This limits the effectiveness of the suppression mechanism (e.g., it cannot suppress a spiking event that is not preceded by another spiking event) and induces variability in the predicted responses. Alternative implementations might let the feedback depend on the continuous internal signal before spike generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or might apply a deterministic spike generation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Model complexity and free parameters</title><p id="P32">In the present study, the implementation of the compared models was guided by the goal of a common framework that made the model structures and the training most comparable. Yet, the number of free parameters was not identical between all models. Given the complexity of the models, this raises the question of whether the comparison might be influenced by over-fitting, which could reduce performance on the test data for models with a higher number of degrees of freedom. However, all evaluations occurred on held-out data not used for model fitting, and the subtractive and the divisive model actually had the same number of free parameters so the observed differences are unlikely to arise from differences in fitting accuracy. Therefore, we believe that over-fitting is not likely to limit the interpretability of our findings.</p><p id="P33">A limitation of the present study is that we restricted our analysis to the use of full-field stimuli without any spatial structure. We made this choice in order to limit the number of free parameters in the model as well as to allow for comparisons between cell types and models independent of how well the spatial filtering and potential nonlinearities in spatial stimulus integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> are captured. On the downside, the use of full-field stimuli makes our analysis insensitive to the spatiotemporal structure of suppression, in particular by not providing for a dedicated suppressive signal pathway from the receptive-field surround.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Comparisons across different species: general features and species-specific variations</title><p id="P34">A particular aspect of our study was the comparison of the models across ganglion cells from different species. This showed an overall high level of consistency of the findings; the similar performance of the subtractive and the divisive model and the generally lower performance of the feedback model was observed in axolotl as well as mouse and marmoset. One somewhat exceptional group of cells was the set of slow axolotl cells that displayed a clear preference for the subtractive model over the divisive model. For these cells, the slowness is particularly pronounced, as filters and response kinetics in the axolotl are overall slower than in the other species, perhaps partly owing to the lower temperature at which the axolotl experiments were performed. This may make the subtractive model, which appeared to generally capture slow temporal dynamics better, particularly suited for the slow cells in this slow retina.</p><p id="P35">For marmoset ganglion cells, we found that including suppression in the response model, either through the subtractive or the divisive model, was more relevant for transient cells than for sustained cells, in particular when considering responses to steps in light intensity. In the primate retina, the ganglion cells types of midget and parasol cells numerically make up the majority of the ganglion cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and among these, parasol cells tend to have transient responses and midget cells sustained responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It thus seems likely that it is the parasol cells for which including suppression in the model is particularly relevant, though we have no independent classification of parasol and midget cells for the present datasets.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Generalization beyond white-noise stimuli</title><p id="P36">Like many other investigations of neuronal response models to sensory stimulation, we based our model fits on recordings under stimulation with white-noise sequences of light intensity. There is increasing awareness, however, that an important follow-up step is to assess how well the obtained model descriptions and deduced insights hold in the context of different, typically more complex stimulus characteristics, such as natural stimuli. In the present study, rather than using natural stimuli, we investigated the generalization to non-white-noise, non-stationary stimuli, with variations in specific stimulus components, such as contrast and temporal frequency. Some studies of models without suppressive components have been used for different contrast levels by recalculating the stimulus components for each contrast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Other investigations have suggested suppressive elements by feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, by divisive gain control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, or by complex biologically motivated combinations of nonlinear filtering and feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> as mechanisms that capture contrast adaptation and thereby promote generalization across contrast levels. These findings are in line with our observation that suppressive model elements help generalization across contrast levels and frequency ranges and that the divisive model is particularly suited for this purpose.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p id="P37">All the experiments and procedures conformed to national and institutional guidelines.

During the recording, the retina was perfused with the oxygenated Ames’ medium (4-5 ml/min), and the temperature of the recording chamber was kept constant at around 33°C in the same way as for the mouse recordings. Spike extraction and sorting were performed by HerdingSpikes2 (github.com/mhhennig/HS2). In short, spiking events were detected independently at each electrode using a fixed threshold, then simultaneous events in neighboring electrodes were triangulated to identify the location and shape of the spike.

Each model contains one branch (for the feedback and the LN model) or two convergent branches (for the subtractive and the divisive model) that represent upstream computation. After combining the two branches additively for the subtractive model and multiplicatively for the divisive model, the upstream computation in each model is followed by an output rectifier and a spike generator. Each upstream branch consists of a stimulus filter and a subsequent nonlinear function. The feedback model’s feedback loop consists of a filter that is applied to the recent history of spiking activity with no nonlinear function (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To maximize the consistency in implementation and training, we combined all four models in one master structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).

The average firing rate of the unit under the white-noise stimulus was required to be larger than 2 Hz for axolotl and larger than 5 Hz for mouse and marmoset. 2. Responses to the frozen-noise presentation for units from axolotl or mouse were required to be sufficiently reliable across trials. To this end, response reliability was assessed by dividing the responses of a cell into two subsets of equal sizes, computing a PSTH separately for each subset, and calculating the variance of the first PSTH explained by the second. The reliability was obtained as the average explained variance across 20 random subset divisions and was required to be larger than 0.5. 3. The difference between the average firing rate in the early (first 30% of the stimulus duration) and late (last 30% of the stimulus duration) part of the recording under the white-noise stimulus was required to be less than 50% of the overall average firing rate. 4. The unit was required to not correspond to an ON-OFF cell, i.e., it should not respond to both light increments and light decrements. ON-OFF cells were detected by a U-shape nonlinear function of the LN model: The function was divided into the left (input &lt; 0) and the right (input &gt; 0) part, then a line was fitted to the left (slope = sL) and another line was fitted to the right part (slope = sR). A cell was classified as ON-OFF, if sL / (|sL| + |sR|) &lt; -0.2. 5. Performance on the test data was required to be at least 60% of the performance on the training data for all four models to reduce the effects of overfitting.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P56">Two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used, except where another test was indicated.
