We report here that olfactory receptor 558 (Olfr558), which has not previously been studied in non-olfactory tissues, localizes to vascular smooth muscle cells in numerous tissues including the kidney and heart. In the kidney, Olfr558 colocalizes with renin (a hormone that plays a key role in blood pressure regulation) in the renal afferent arteriole. Based on the localization of Olfr558, we hypothesized that Olfr558 plays a role in blood pressure regulation. We find that sex differences in blood pressure are intact in Olfr558 wildtype (WT) mice, but, are absent in Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice. We find that male KO mice have lowered diastolic blood pressure, decreased renin expression and activity, and altered vascular reactivity. Female KO mice exhibit increased blood pressure and increased pulse wave velocity, indicating increased vascular stiffness. The human ortholog of Olfr558, OR51E1, was previously identified as a locus associated with diastolic blood pressure. We report here that a rare OR51E1 missense variant has a statistically significant sex interaction effect with diastolic blood pressure, increasing diastolic blood pressure in women but decreasing it in men. In addition, we characterize how two different clinically relevant OR51E1 variants influence OR51E1 signaling <italic>in vitro</italic>. In sum, our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for Olfr558/OR51E1 to mediate sex differences in blood pressure by altering renin, vascular reactivity, and arterial stiffness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Olfr558</kwd><kwd>OR51E1</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>renin</kwd><kwd>vascular tone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Sex differences in blood pressure are well-established, with premenopausal women having lower blood pressure than men by ∼10mmHg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These sex differences are modeled well in C57BL/6 mice, where females have mean arterial pressure ∼10 mmHg lower than males by telemetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, the clinical definition of hypertension is identical in men and women (&gt;130/80 for systolic pressure/ diastolic pressure), in part because the mechanisms underlying sex differences in blood pressure regulation are only partially understood. Although sex hormones likely contribute to sex differences in blood pressure, they are not fully responsible: hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women does not consistently alter blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and lowered testosterone in aging men is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Similarly, sex chromosomes may contribute to sex differences in blood pressure, but cannot fully explain these differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Olfactory receptors (ORs), the largest family of G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs), act in the olfactory epithelium to mediate the sense of smell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, ORs are also expressed and play functional roles in non-olfactory tissues such as kidney, eyes, prostate, and sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Although there are 1000 murine ORs in the genome, olfactory receptor 558 (Olfr558) is a particularly promising candidate for study. First, Olfr558 is one of only 3 mammalian ORs to have been well-conserved by evolution: Olfr558 has a clear ortholog in all placental mammals, including mice, rats, rabbits, elephants, horses, and 5 species of primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and the human ortholog (olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 1; OR51E1) has one of the lowest rates of single nucleotide polymorphism among human ORs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Second, OR51E1 is widely expressed outside the olfactory epithelium in humans (in 13 different tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>), and we previously reported that Olfr558 is expressed in murine kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Third, most ORs are orphan receptors with no identified ligands; however, we have previously identified ligands for Olfr558, with the strongest ligand being butyrate, one of the major short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, we undertook a study to uncover the physiological role of Olfr558 and found that this evolutionarily conserved receptor has a novel role to mediate sex differences in blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="P4">All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Animals</title><p id="P5">Global Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice were generated by Ingenious Targeting Laboratory, using Flexible Accelerated STOP TetO (F.A.S.T) technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> by inserting a stop cassette prior to the ATG start site of Olfr558. Olfr558 heterozygotes (C57BL6/N background) were bred in-house to obtain Olfr558 wild-type (WT) and KO littermates. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with maximum of five adult mice per cage. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR of tail biopsies.

Briefly, the thoracic aorta was cut into 2-mm rings after carefully removing connective tissues. Each aortic ring was placed into Krebs buffer (containing [in mM] 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.1 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 11 glucose), and then mounted to a myograph chamber (DMT) and continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Two wires were inserted into the lumen of the mesenteric artery in HEPES-Tyrode solution in a petri-dish, and the vessel segments were mounted on the wire myograph chamber. All mounted vessels were submerged in Krebs buffer. The mesenteric artery was stretched to a final tension of 500 mg in 100-mg force increments. KCl (60 mM for Aorta and 100 mM for mesentery) were added to determine vessel viability and obtain the maximal contractility. Phenylephrine (PE) induced vasoconstriction was studied using increasing doses of PE (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M). Endothelial-mediated vasorelaxation was then evaluated using increasing doses of acetylcholine (ACh, 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M) after PE pre-constriction. Finally, endothelial-independent vasorelaxation was measured by increasing doses of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M) in vessels pre-constricted with PE.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Pulse wave velocity (PWV)</title><p id="P12">PWV was measured noninvasively using a high-frequency and high-resolution Doppler spectrum analyzer, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

The aortic pulse wave at thorax and abdomen were separately recorded at a distance of ∼3 cm using a 10 MHz probe, simultaneously with electrocardiograph recording. The time for the pulse wave transit from the thoracic to the abdominal aorta was measured using the electrocardiograph as a fixed point. Subsequently, PWV was calculated as the separation distance divided by the pulse transit time between the two points.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Tensile testing</title><p id="P13">The mechanical properties of intact and decellularized aortic rings were measured by tensile testing, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Briefly, the thoracic aorta from 10-week-old Olfr558 WT and KO females were harvested and cut into 2-mm rings. Two intact and two decellularized rings from each animal were tested. Vessel dimensions (lumen diameter, wall thickness, and length) were calculated by the transverse and longitudinal images of aortic rings obtained using a light microscope. Each vessel was then mounted on an electromechanical puller (DMT). After calibration, the pins were moved apart using an electromotor, and displacement and force applied by the vessel wall on the pin were continuously recorded. To calculate engineering stress (S), force (F) was normalized to the initial stress-free area of the specimen (S=F/2t × L; t=thickness, L= length of the aortic ring). Engineering strain (λ) was calculated as the ratio of displacement to the initial stress-free diameter. The stress-strain relationship was represented by the equation S=α exp (β λ), where α and β are constants. α and β were determined by nonlinear regression for each sample and used to generate stress-strain curves by treating the x-axis as a continuous variable. Incremental elastic modulus (E<sub>inc</sub>) was calculated as the slope of the stress-strain curve at a strain of 0.5 and 1.8.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Other <italic>in vivo</italic> studies</title><p id="P14">Whole blood samples were collected from the superficial temporal vein of 3-month old Olfr558 WT and KO mice, and were analyzed by an iStat Chem8+ cartridge (Abbott).

A GFR device (MediBeacon), which measures transcutaneous fluorescence, was attached to the hairless region of the back and secured with surgical tape. A 7 mg/100 g body weight of FITC-sinistrin was retro-orbitally injected into the mouse who was then placed back into the cage with free access to water and food for 1.5 h, after which the device was removed and data analyzed using MediBeacon software. Mice body weight on week 3 and 8 were measured, kidney weight/body weight (KW/BW) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) were measured as well.

Here, we performed new genetic association analyses of DBP within the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, in order to conduct more detailed stratified analyses of this published variant, and also to analyze a new rare variant of interest. We used the same dataset that was used for the previous GWAS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), as described in Evangelou et al, 2018. All UKB individuals analyzed are of European ancestry. In order to perform simple linear regression analyses, we excluded 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> degree relatives, leaving a total of n=423,657 individuals for analysis. Linear regression analyses testing the association of the genetic variant with DBP were adjusted for the following covariates: sex, age, age^2, BMI, genotyping chip subset of UKB, and top 10 Principal components of ancestry. Sex-stratified analyses were performed using two separate subgroups to compare males vs females. In addition, an analysis was performed on all individuals with a sex-interaction term to identify any sex-specific effects. Finally, given the changes in blood pressure that occur with aging (particularly in women), we also performed age-stratified analyses in women (&lt;50 vs &gt;50 years) and in men (&lt;50 vs &gt;50 years), and a corresponding age-interaction analysis. Within each analyzed subgroup, we calculated the mean DBP measurement for creation of plots. We performed analyses for two variants: (i) the common missense variant, rs17224476 (chr11:4673788, NCBI build 37), previously identified by Evangelou, et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> as the lead variant at the <italic>OR51E1</italic> locus achieving the most significant association for DBP. And, (ii), a rare missense variant, rs202113356, which we previously published to alter OR51E1 function (chr11:4673788, NCBI build 37)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This rare variant had not been analyzed previously by Evangelou et al, as the published GWAS only included common variants. As rs202113356 is a rare variant, there were no individuals in UKB with two copies of the minor allele A. Thus, for consistency, all of our statistical analyses for both variants are performed according to a binary genotype model comparing non-carriers (GG) versus carriers of the minor allele (AG/AA). The common variant (rs17224476) is directly genotyped within the UKB data, whereas the rare variant (rs202113356) is extracted from the imputed genetic data, with high imputation quality Rsq = 0.8. For analysis by genotype groups, the genetic data was converted to hard-call genotype format using PLINK software, yielding N=58 individuals with missing data for the imputed rare variant if their imputation certainty did not reach the hard-call threshold in PLINK.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Cloning and immunofluorescence</title><p id="P18">OR51E1 has been previously cloned with Lucy-Flag-Rho tags at the N-terminus in the pME18S vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

The flag tag on these constructs is on the N-terminus, and thus can only be labeled in live cells if the OR reaches the cell surface. Cells were then washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with diluted superblock for 1 h at room temperature.

However, this previous GWAS did not examine sex-specific effects. So, here, we performed sex- and age-stratified analyses on OR51E1 variants using UKB data. Our analysis focused on the lead, common, missense variant (rs17224476) from the Evaneglou, et al study, and, also on a rare missense variant (rs202113356) which we have previously studied in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.

In the kidney, Olfr558 is expressed in both afferent and efferent arterioles, including renin positive cells. Functional studies using Olfr558 WT and KO mice demonstrate that Olfr558 is required for sex differences in blood pressure. Olfr558 KO males exhibit decreased DBP, whereas Olfr558 KO females have increased MAP and DBP. Lowered DBP in the males may be driven by decreased plasma renin, a muted constriction to PE in the aorta, and an exaggerated relaxation to SNP in the mesentery. The increased blood pressure in KO females is likely driven by increased vascular stiffness, as indicated by the elevated pulse wave velocity. In humans, OR51E1 has been identified as a locus that is associated with significant changes in DBP. We find that a rare OR51E1 variant induces changes in DBP which match both the direction (increased in females, and decreased in males) and the magnitude seen in KO mice of each sex.

Therefore, Olfr558-induced sex differences in blood pressure cannot be explained by renin alone.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Vascular Tone</title><p id="P41">We find that Olfr558 WT males and females exhibit similar responses to PE and ACh in both aortic rings and mesenteric arteries <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This is consistent with a previous report that mesenteric arteries demonstrate similar relaxation to ACh in female and male rats, and were unaffected by ovariectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, but contradicts reports that aortic rings show more constriction to phenylephrine in male versus female rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that vascular constriction is significantly enhanced in ovariectomized versus intact female rats (with no difference between castrated and intact male rats), suggesting that the sex differences in vascular tone are likely related to sex hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Of note, the maximum contraction to KCl in WT mesenteric arteries is higher in females vs males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P42">As for genotypic differences, male KOs exhibit decreased constriction to PE in the aorta, and exaggerated relaxation to SNP in the mesentery as compared to WT males. However, <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies in females found no differences in the response to PE, ACh, or SNP in WT vs KO. Although KO females do have an increased response to KCl in the aorta, this alone seems unlikely to explain the blood pressure phenotype. However, female KOs manifest increased pulse wave velocity <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating stiffer blood vessels. The fact that the female KO vessels appeared normal <italic>ex vivo</italic> but were stiffer <italic>in vivo</italic> implies that there may be a circulating factors or hormones required to manifest the phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Human genetic analysis</title><p id="P43">In support of a role for this evolutionarily conserved OR in blood pressure regulation, OR51E1 was previously identified as a locus associated with DBP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We report here that a (relatively) common OR51E1 variant (rs17224476; MAF=11.1%) is associated with increased DBP and affects blood pressure similarly in both men and women, whereas a rare OR51E1 variant (rs202113356; MAF=0.025%) effects blood pressure in the opposite direction in men as opposed to women. Notably, both the magnitude and the direction of the change in blood pressure for the rare variant is remarkably similar to the changes seen in male and female Olfr558 KO. It is also intriguing that the rare variant seems to have a stronger effect on increasing blood pressure in women &lt;50 versus women &gt;50. It is imperative to note that due to the rarity of this variant, the number of patients with this variant is quite small and thus we must interpret our conclusions appropriately according to the reduced statistical power. However, the presence of a variant in humans which differentially alters blood pressure by sex is supportive of the idea that our findings in mice are relevant to other species, including humans, especially when we observe such consistency and similarity in the effect estimates from our analyses in both humans and mice.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Olfr558/OR51E1 trafficking and ligands</title><p id="P44">To explore how these two OR51E1 variants may alter the cell biology of OR51E1 signaling, we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. We previously published that the surface expression of the rare variant is reduced as compared to wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, however, we find here that the common variant does not alter surface expression. We previously reported that butyrate is the best ligand for Olfr558/OR51E1, and that other ligands including IVA, VA, 3-MAV, 4-MAV, and CCA also activate Olfr558 and OR51E1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. In this study, we find that the activity of both the common and rare variants are reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to wild-type OR51E1. Given that both variants reduce OR51E1 activity, yet the effects of the variants <italic>in vivo</italic> are different in each sex, it seems likely factors are missing from our <italic>in vitro</italic> system which prevent full recapitulation of OR51E1 biology. These factors may include sex chromosomal effects (HEK293T are XX), the absence of gonadal hormones, or downstream signaling partners. Of note, in our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies we were unable to detect any differences in Olfr558 expression (levels, or, localization) in males and females. Thus, there are likely other signals which “tell” the receptor whether it is in a male versus a female, and/or which alter its downstream signaling accordingly. Thus, moving forward, it is important to examine both a potential role for gonadal hormones to influence the receptor, and, whether there may be genes on the X or Y chromosome which alter some aspect of Olfr558 expression or signaling.</p><p id="P45">In conclusion, we have elucidated that an evolutionarily conserved OR is required for sex differences in blood pressure. In a mouse model, we find that Olfr558 KO females increase blood pressure, which is associated with increased arterial stiffness, whereas KO males decrease DBP due to alternations in renin as well as vascular reactivity. Uncovering the origin of sex differences in blood pressure regulation can help to move the field toward a more thoughtful approach to blood pressure management in men and women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S35"><title>List of abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>Olfr558</term><def><p id="P46">olfactory receptor 558</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p id="P47">wildtype</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KO</term><def><p id="P48">knockout</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORs</term><def><p id="P49">olfactory receptors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPCRs</term><def><p id="P50">G-protein-coupled-receptors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR51E1</term><def><p id="P51">olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCFAs</term><def><p id="P52">short-chain fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p id="P53">phenylephrine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNP</term><def><p id="P54">sodium nitroprusside</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACh</term><def><p id="P55">acetylcholine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFR</term><def><p id="P56">glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KW/BW</term><def><p id="P57">kidney weight/body weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HW/BW</term><def><p id="P58">heart weight/body weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR51E1 A156T</term><def><p id="P59">OR51E1 variant rs2021113356</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR51E1 S10N</term><def><p id="P60">OR51E1 variant rs17224476</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFA</term><def><p id="P61">paraformaldehyde</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEK 293T</term><def><p id="P62">human embryonic kidney 293T</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RTP1S</term><def><p id="P63">receptor transporting protein 1S</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Golf</term><def><p id="P64">olfactory G protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVA</term><def><p id="P65">isovaleric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p id="P66">valeric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>3-MVA</term><def><p id="P67">3-methylvaleric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>4-MVA</term><def><p id="P68">4-methylvaleric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCA</term><def><p id="P69">cyclobutene-carboxylic acid</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS157274-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d91aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS157274-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d91aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS157274-supplement-Supplemental_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d91aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S36"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Jason Sanchez, Dylan Sarver, Jie Sun, Shuai Wu, Brian Poll, and P.
