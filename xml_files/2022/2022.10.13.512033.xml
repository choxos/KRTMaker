Why bacteria have evolved such a wide array of weapon systems remains a mystery. Here we develop an agent-based model to compare short-range weapons that require cell-cell contact, with long-range weapons that rely on diffusion. Our models predict that contact weapons are useful when an attacking strain is outnumbered, facilitating invasion and establishment. By contrast, ranged weapons tend to only be effective when attackers are abundant. We test our predictions with the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which naturally carries multiple weapons, including contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) and diffusing tailocins. As predicted, short-range CDI functions better at low frequency, while long-range tailocins require high frequency and cell density to function effectively. Head-to-head competitions between the two weapon types further support our predictions: a tailocin attacker only defeats CDI when it is numerically dominant, but then we find it can be devastating. Finally, we show that the two weapons work well together when one strain employs both. We conclude that short and long-range weapons serve different functions and allow bacteria to fight both as individuals and as a group.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">One of the most striking illustrations of Darwin’s ‘struggle for existence’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> is the evolution of weaponry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Weapons – traits that evolved, at least in part, to injure and harm competitors – have evolved many times in animals, with examples in groups as diverse as trilobites, insects, mammals and dinosaurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Bacteria are a second group of organisms that commonly evolve weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Many clinical antibiotics were first isolated from bacteria that release them into the environment to inhibit competitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Ribosomally-synthesized bacteriocins are deployed in a similar manner and include both chemical toxins and phage-tail derived tailocins which physically punch holes in competitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Bacteria also deploy close-range weapons that require cell-cell contact. Examples include type VI secretion systems, which fire toxin-laden needles into competing cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and contact-dependent inhibition systems, which are toxin-loaded filaments anchored to the outside of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The diversity of weapons seen in bacteria, therefore, certainly rivals that seen in animals. However, there is a notable difference between the two groups. Animal species tend to carry a single weapon type – e.g. horns <italic>or</italic> antlers <italic>or</italic> tusks – with a few potential exceptions (the dinosaur <italic>Ankylosaurus magniventris</italic> had both horns and a bludgeoning tail club)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. By contrast, bacteria commonly carry multiple types of weapon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a problematic opportunistic pathogen, due to its ability to withstand numerous antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Alongside its defensive capacity, this species is a striking illustration of how many weapons bacteria can carry. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> produces multiple bacteriocins and toxic small molecules, which serve as long range weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, it can deploy contact-dependent inhibition and up to three type VI secretion systems as short-range weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. More generally, among species whose weapons have been characterized in detail, many carry both short and long-range weapons, including strains of <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. What is the evolutionary basis for the prevalence of multiple weapons? One argument is that bacteria are simply more aggressive than other species such as animals, and that this favours the simultaneous use of multiple weapons. Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments suggest that bacteria engage in combat much more regularly than animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, which typically avoid using their weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, a general increase in aggression does not explain why bacteria carry multiple <italic>types</italic> of weapons, as opposed to simply just investing more in a single type. We hypothesized that bacteria carry multiple weapons because they serve different functions during competition. We further reasoned that this explanation is most compelling for weapons that function at different ranges, a factor which can strongly influence the outcome of bacterial contests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to test this hypothesis by performing a direct comparison of the competitive benefits of short versus long-range weapons.</p><p id="P4">We first employ a realistic agent-based model of bacterial competition that has previously been used to understand the evolutionary function of single weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The power of this framework is that it allows one to rapidly study a wide variety of competition scenarios with relative ease, while being realistic enough to generate focused predictions for empirical testing. The model predicts that short- and long-range weapons do indeed have the potential to serve different functions. We test these predictions by genome editing <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1 to generate strains that are susceptible to its own short- and long-range weapons (contact-dependent inhibition and tailocins, respectively). This approach allows us to directly compare weapons’ functioning in a controlled genetic background. In support of the modelling, we find that short and long-range weapons can provide cells with different advantages during combat. Contact weapons can be effective when an attacking strain is outnumbered, facilitating invasion and establishment. By contrast, ranged weapons are only effective when attackers are abundant, but here they prove to be a devastating form of attack.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An agent-based model of short and long-range weapons</title><p id="P5">We first employ an established computational model where each cell is simulated as an individual agent (hence, ‘agent’ or ‘individual-based’ model, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Bacterial cells are seeded onto a two-dimensional surface where they grow and divide to fill a vertical space, as can occur in a biofilm for example, or at the intestinal mucosa of a mammalian host. Cells interact with each other both physically – pushing and displacing each other as they grow and collide – and chemically, by producing toxins that can inhibit strains of a different genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). When cells reach a specified height they are removed, mimicking dispersal or shedding from the top of the community. Bacterial weapons can vary substantially in a wide range of properties, including method of delivery (short or long-range), quantity produced, deadliness, cost of production and, of course, the strain or species where they are found<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This can make like-for-like comparisons of different weapons empirically challenging. However, with a model one can precisely define, and systematically vary, such properties of bacterial weapons and study their effects (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The model is also spatially explicit, which is particularly important for contact-based weapons whose action depends upon the occurrence of physical contacts between cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Modelling predicts distinct strengths of short and long-range weapons</title><p id="P6">We use our model to compare short and long-range bacterial weapons that – other than their range of effect – are as similar as possible. Attacking cells can ‘fire’ a short-range weapon at random from their cell surface, intoxicating any susceptible cell(s) that are contacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is intended to simulate contact weapons including type VI secretion systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and contact-dependent inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Alternatively, attacking cells can release a diffusible factor into the environment, which could represent range of toxins, including a small-molecule antibiotic, a ribosomally-synthesized bacteriocin, or a tailocin. The rate at which toxins are exported out of attacking cells is matched for short- and long-range weapons, and is controlled via a secretion rate parameter, <italic>k<sub>sec</sub></italic>. Toxins also have matched potencies: both contact and diffusible toxins are lethal once intracellular concentrations exceed a set threshold <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>. We assume that producing either toxin incurs an equivalent growth rate cost in attacking cells that is proportional to the secretion rate, i.e. increasing the toxin secretion rate results in a lower growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We begin by modelling competitions between an attacker strain, which either has a short- or a long-range weapon, and a second strain that is susceptible to the weapon. We look at a wide range of competition scenarios, varying the initial frequency of the attacker, initial density of cells, and the amount that the attacker invests in its weapon (i.e. toxin secretion rate). In each case the two strains are allowed to grow and interact for a set period of time (10h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), after which we compare the final attacker: susceptible cell ratio to its initial value (‘competitive advantage’, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Both weapons tend to perform better when cells are seeded at high initial density, because this promotes cell-cell contact for short-range weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and toxin accumulation for long-range weapons. Nevertheless, there remains a clear difference between the two weapon types. Across the majority of scenarios tested, the contact-dependent weapon provided an advantage to the attacker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1A</xref>). By contrast, the long-range weapon is more sensitive to starting conditions, requiring a higher secretion rate to be effective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1B</xref>), and only reaching its full potential when the attacker is seeded at high frequency and high density.</p><p id="P8">The models suggest a particular advantage of contact-dependent weapons: they are effective even when users are at a numerical disadvantage. This benefit is likely to be most significant when invading an established population, because here invaders will be outnumbered by residents. We explored this scenario further by modelling established biofilms of susceptible cells and simulating the late arrival of attacker cells (by replacing some of the susceptible cells at random with attackers). In this scenario, cells using the short-range weapon were able to successfully invade an established population, where increasing toxin secretion rate increased their success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1C</xref>)). Conversely, long-range weapons never enabled invasion, as producer cells could never amass in sufficient numbers to kill the susceptible strain.</p><p id="P9">In summary, even though we closely matched the properties of the two weapon types, the models predict that they perform very differently across the variety of competition scenarios we tested. In general, contact weapons work well across a range of frequencies, including cases when a strain is rare, allowing it to invade. By contrast, long-range weapons only function well when a producing strain is relatively abundant, but here they are an effective form of attack.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Using genome editing to generate strains for weapon comparisons</title><p id="P10">Our modelling predicts that a long-range weapon will perform poorly at low attacker frequency, which is consistent with the findings of several previous studies – both theoretical and empirical – showing that toxin production is most effective when attackers are abundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, to test our predictions on the relative benefits of short versus long-range weapons, a well-controlled comparison of the two types of weapons is required. To do this, we turned to the opportunistic pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (strain PAO1), which naturally carries both short- and long-range weapons. Of its long-range weapons, the mechanical tailocins (specifically its R pyocins) are known to be highly effective weapons under biofilm-like conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As for short-range weapons, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> has a dedicated antibacterial type VI secretion system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but it is under complex regulation and typically only fires in response to incoming attacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore we instead chose to focus on a contact dependent inhibition (CDI) system of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> as a short-range weapon to test predictions.</p><p id="P11">For both weapons, we used genome editing to generate a strain that is susceptible to the weapon but otherwise well-matched to the attacker, allowing us to study the effects of each weapon on bacterial competition. For CDI, this was straightforward: deleting the three gene locus that encodes the CDI transporter, toxin filament and immunity (PA0040-PA0041), resulting in a strain that does not have CDI and is susceptible to CDI. For the tailocins, we selected pyocin R2, but here resistance is more complex as it is determined by the composition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) moieties on the outer membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Here, we engineered a susceptible strain by deleting both the pyocin R2 locus and the gene <italic>wbpL</italic>, which causes a deficiency in the LPS that in our strain background leads to susceptibility to pyocin R2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2</xref>). However, this deficiency in the LPS caused a competitive disadvantage to the susceptible strain, independent of the effects of tailocins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>). To generate a near-matched attacker strain, therefore we made a Δ<italic>wapR</italic> deletion in the wildtype strain, which causes a similar LPS deficiency but not one that leads to pyocin R2 susceptibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In the absence of the effects of pyocin R2 (hereafter ‘tailocin’), the <italic>wapR</italic> mutation puts the attacker at a moderate disadvantage relative to the <italic>wbpL</italic> mutation in the susceptible strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4</xref>). We quantified this difference and used it to adjust the predicted competitive advantage of the attacker strain in our experiments, in order to estimate the effects of the weapon alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). However, in practice this adjustment has little impact on the data because the benefits of the tailocin, when they are seen, massively outweigh this moderate cost of <italic>wapR</italic> deletion (for further discussion of these LPS mutations, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Experiments with P. aeruginosa shows distinct advantages to short- and long-range weapons</title><p id="P13">With these strains, we could then test our modelling predictions for a scenario where attackers armed with either a contact or diffusible weapon compete against a susceptible strain (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). We performed competitions when cells are growing on agar (the ‘colony biofilm model’)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, because this allows us to capture the dense, spatially-structured conditions thought to be typical of bacterial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, and because both weapons are expected to function well in this context (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The interior and edge of bacterial colonies represent distinct competition scenarios, due to the much greater potential for population expansion at the edge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. We therefore decided to sample each region separately (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), although in practice the competition outcomes are similar between the two. Consistent with previous work, we find that both systems have the potential to provide large competitive benefits for an attacking strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. However, we also find that the outcome is strongly dependent upon the conditions of a given competition.</p><p id="P14">As the models predict, high attacker frequency is most important for the functioning of the long-range weapon (tailocin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In comparison, the short-range weapon (CDI) almost always performs equivalently or better at intermediate and low frequencies, especially at the colony edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This includes cases where the performance of CDI peaks at intermediate frequency as in the model (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, high density, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, density 10<sup>4</sup> cells). We also observe an improvement in the long-ranged weapon as initial cell densities increase. This pattern is again predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), although the effect is substantially stronger in the experiments where we can study much larger total numbers and ranges of initial cell density. Fluorescence micrographs of the colonies show how the competitions play out in space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S5</xref>), and reveal differences between the middle and the edge of colonies, with the tailocin performing relatively poorly at the colony edge compared to CDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> middle bottom). This pattern is consistent again with the requirements for tailocins to build up to be effective, as this build up is expected to happen first in the colony interior and the colony edge last.</p><p id="P15">In summary, our experiments show that both weapons can be highly effective, but that the two weapons perform best under different conditions. Tailocins are extremely effective at high frequencies and densities, while CDI performs more consistently across conditions, including the unique ability to provide a competitive advantage when a strain starts out rare and at low density.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Head-to-head contests of short and long-range weapons</title><p id="P16">Our first experiments examine the performance of each weapon type against susceptible cells that do not fight back. We next explore the case where users of the two weapons meet. In this situation, a weapon can potentially take on new significance, as eliminating competitor cells also serves to reduce incoming attacks. The agent-based model again predicts that both initial frequency and cell density can be critical to the performance of the weapons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3AB</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>).</p><p id="P17">At low cell density, the impact of both weapons is limited, but the contact weapon user does gain an advantage when it starts in the majority. At high cell density, the long-range weapon user can win but, as in the single weapon competitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), this requires it to start at high frequency. When the long-range strain is at low or equal initial frequency, the contact weapon performs the best.</p><p id="P18">To test these predictions, we competed a strain susceptible to CDI against a strain susceptible to tailocins (pyocin R2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3CD</xref>). The CDI attacker was thus an LPS mutant (Δ<italic>wbpL</italic>, above, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), which renders it susceptible to the tailocin. As this mutation causes changes to the cell envelope, we first checked that the CDI system remained functional. The gene deletion (Δ<italic>wbpL</italic>) did not prevent CDI from functioning, but it did reduce the advantage provided by CDI at lower initial densities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S7</xref>). Going forward, therefore, we only provide data from the two highest initial cell densities (10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> cells/μL). We also focus on data from the interior of the colony going forward, as it is most reflective of typical biofilm growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, but data from the colony edge is similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S8</xref>). As predicted by the high cell-density model, only the CDI using strain is able to gain a significant advantage in equal-frequency competitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref>). Moreover, again as predicted, both weapon users are able to win when they start in the majority. This effect is particularly strong for the tailocin, which provides a large competitive advantage when starting from high frequency.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Contact and diffusible weapons are complementary</title><p id="P19">Our findings thus show that short- and long-range weapons can provide distinct advantages, which helps to explain why bacteria would carry both types. However, it is possible that these advantages are not provided simultaneously in practice. Therefore, we sought to experimentally study the effects of a single strain using both weapons, and compare it to each weapon being used alone. To allow susceptibility to tailocins and make the comparison as fair as possible, we put all attacker strains in the same LPS genetic background (Δ<italic>wapR</italic>), and all susceptible strains in the Δ<italic>wbpL</italic> background. All competition outcomes are again adjusted for the moderate disadvantage caused by the Δ<italic>wapR</italic> mutation, and we focus on high initial cell-densities as before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S9</xref>, above). As predicted by the study of each weapon individually, across the competitions and contexts, the two weapons function in a complementary fashion, providing an equivalent or greater benefit than either weapon alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S9, S10</xref>). That is, we find that carrying both CDI and tailocins can allow a strain to receive benefits from both.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Bacteria use a vast variety of weapons to inhibit and kill competitors. Here we have shown that two major categories of weapons – short- and long-range – can provide distinct and complementary advantages to bacteria. Weapons that rely on contact between cells are generally effective whether a strain is rare or common. Conversely, weapons that diffuse across long ranges are more reliant on high producer cell frequency and density. However, under these conditions, long-range weapons can be particularly powerful in eliminating both armed and unarmed competitors. These observations help to answer two related questions. First, why do short- and long-range weapons exist at all in bacteria? Here, our work suggests that a strain may benefit more from one weapon type or another, depending on its ecology. For example, if bacterial fitness is more determined by the ability of a given strain to invade communities than persist in a community, contact-dependent weapons may be most useful. This matches with observations showing that pathogens including <italic>Salmonella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, <italic>Shigella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholera</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> use the type VI secretion system (T6SS) during invasion of established communities, although gut-resident <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> can also use its T6SS to repel invaders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> underlining the flexibility of short range weapons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The second question is: why do many bacteria carry both short and long-range weapons? Again, the fact that the two weapon types can perform distinct functions provides an answer to why a cell would carry both. However, the possession of multiple weapons may also carry other non-mutually exclusive advantages. If two weapons are simply more potent than one, this can also favour carrying several of them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In addition, if a given competitor is likely to carry resistance to some of the available weapons, natural selection may favour using multiple weapons simply to increase the likelihood that the competitor is susceptible to at least one. This explanation may be particularly important for cases where bacteria carry several of the same weapon type and functional differences are less pronounced e.g. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> releasing multiple S pyocin protein toxins and tailocins simultaneously via cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">If the use of multiple weapons can be so beneficial, why is it not more widely seen in organisms other than bacteria? Short-range weapons, like CDI and T6SSs, can be used against competitors by lone cells. The effectiveness of long-range weapons, meanwhile, rests upon the strength in numbers that comes with group living. There are some examples of group combat strategies in animals. Colonial marine invertebrates engage in toxin-mediated competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, and the Asian honeybee <italic>Apis cerana</italic> kills the giant Asian hornet <italic>Vespa mandarinia</italic> by ‘heat balling’, whereby the bees cover the hornet and vibrate their flight muscles to overheat it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. However, this latter example is best described as predator defense and, in general, group-level strategies appear to be the exception in most animal conflicts. Instead, most animal contests are dyadic, meaning they occur between just two individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. By contrast, mounting evidence suggests that bacteria commonly live, and fight, as part of large groups. This lifestyle gives them the opportunity to engage both as individuals and as collectives. Our work suggests that it is this propensity for group living that has led to the widespread evolution of both short- and long-range weapons.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Agent-based modelling</title><p id="P23">A major challenge in comparing bacterial weapons is that even within the broad categories of contact and diffusible, their method of deployment varies substantially.

In non-dimensional form, pseudo-steady-state solutions to this equation are given by <italic>∇<sup>2</sup>u<sub>T</sub></italic> = 𝔻<italic><sub>T</sub> ɸ(x,y)</italic>.

For this comparison to be as fair as possible, we assume in all cases that both weapons involve the secretion of the same (hypothetical) toxin, at the same rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>T,cell</italic></sub>, with the same potency (lethal concentration) <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>, and at the same growth cost <italic>c</italic>. For simplicity, the secretion rate is fixed within each simulation, while in reality many bacteria responsively upregulate toxin production via competition sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> and other mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Here we outline the equations that link these properties between the two models, bridging the (discrete) contact model with the (continuum) diffusible toxin model. For contact weapons, the per-cell secretion rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>T,cell</italic></sub> is given by <italic>k<sub>T,cell</sub> = k<sub>sec</sub>T<sub>sec</sub></italic>, with <italic>k<sub>sec</sub></italic> [h<sup>-1</sup>] the per-cell secretion rate, and <italic>T<sub>sec</sub></italic> [kg<sub>T</sub>] the mass of toxin released by each secretion event.
