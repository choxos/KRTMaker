Powerful as this resource is, <italic>T. brucei</italic> has multiple developmental forms and we previously only analysed the procyclic form. This is an insect life cycle stage, leaving the mammalian bloodstream form unanalysed. The expectation is that between life stages protein localisation would not change dramatically (completely unchanged or shifting to analogous stage-specific structures). However, this has not been specifically tested. Similarly, which organelles tend to contain proteins with stage-specific expression can be predicted from known stage specific adaptations but has not been comprehensively tested. Here, we used endogenous tagging to determine the sub-cellular localisation of the majority of proteins encoded by transcripts significantly upregulated in the bloodstream form and compared them to the existing localisation data in procyclic forms. This confirmed the localisation of known and identified the localisation of novel stage-specific proteins, giving a map of which organelles tend to contain stage specific proteins: the mitochondrion for the procyclic form, and the endoplasmic reticulum, endocytic system and cell surface in the bloodstream form.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is a unicellular eukaryotic parasite and, like any unicellular organism, adjusts its gene expression profile to adapt to different environments. As an obligate parasite, the environments it encounters are exclusively within the host and vector and gene expression profile changes give rise to the appropriate protein machinery to adapt the parasite to these niches. <italic>T. brucei</italic> has three main replicative life cycle stages: the procyclic form (PCF, fly midgut), the epimastigote form (EMF, fly salivary glands) and the bloodstream form (BSF, mammalian host bloodstream), although within these stages there is also additional specialisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The PCF and BSF are readily grown in culture.</p><p id="P3">The PCF and BSF have many well characterised differences, including the BSF VSG surface coat and associated expression machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], metabolic differences and associated remodelling of the mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], morphology, and morphogenesis adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], along with many more. However, genome-wide mapping of the global changes are broadly limited to gene expression level, most extensively determined at the mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] which does not correlate fully with protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Few studies consider later steps in protein production: translation (mRNA ribosome footprinting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and protein abundance (quantitative proteomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Despite the comparative ease of culturing PCFs and BSFs and the powerful reverse genetic tools available, a huge number of genes with evidence for BSF upregulation are not characterised.</p><p id="P4">Here, we aim to address this using subcellular protein localisations. We have demonstrated the power of this approach in PCFs with the TrypTag genome-wide protein localisation project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This showed how informative localisation can be for holistic mapping of potential protein function, although naturally does not determine specific molecular function. We also previously used high throughput tagging BSF-upregulated genes to identify ESB1, necessary for transcription of the expression site containing the VSG gene along with expression site associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, our previous analysis of these BSF localisations was minimal, aiming only to identify expression site body components. Here, we present analysis of an extended version of this BSF localisation dataset as both evidence for how BSFs are adapted relative to PCFs and as a resource for the research community.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P5">To enrich for proteins likely to have BSF-specific functions, we devised three gene tagging sets based on data available at the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Set 1) 289 genes with mRNAs upregulated in BSFs, based primarily on mRNAseq from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] but manually incorporating some genes identified as strongly upregulated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] not in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Set 2) <italic>T. brucei-specific</italic> genes (defined as those which lack both an <italic>L. major</italic> Friedlin and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Brener non-Esmareldo ortholog) not already included in Set 1, which met one of two criteria based on TrypTag PCF tagging data available at the time: Set 2a) the 30 genes that had failed to give a convincing signal above background by both N and C terminal tagging, and Set 2b) the 21 genes which had a nucleoplasm or nucleolar localisation. The former were selected to test whether lack of PCF signal correlated with BSF stage-specific expression, and the latter as candidates for <italic>T. brucei-specific</italic> BSF nuclear structure adaptation.</p><p id="P6">We prioritised N terminal tagging because this preserves the 3’ untranslated region (UTR), suspected to confer most gene regulation in trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, when a protein had a predicted N terminal signal peptide C terminal tagging was instead necessary. If we failed to generate a drug resistant population, we repeated construct generation and transfection at least once. The final success rate generating cell lines (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) was 72.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), of which 76.6% had signal we manually classified as unlike background fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) – i.e. a convincing subcellular localisation.</p><p id="P7">For the final analysis of these localisations, we re-analysed the gene sets based on the entire TrypTag PCF localisation dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and TriTrypDB version 59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). There were some changes; altered OrthoMCL sensitivity due to addition of new genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), additional PCF tagging repeats providing a strong convincing localisation where only weak signal was previously observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>), and changed PCF localisation annotation (e.g. from nucleoplasm to nuclear envelope, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). We also defined a final criterion for upregulation in the BSF: transcripts significantly upregulated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Student’s T test) by mRNAseq in the BSF relative to the PCF (data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]). However, overall, the gene sets well reflect their original purpose.</p><p id="P8">We observed convincing fluorescent signal in BSFs for many tagged proteins in Set 1 (upregulated in BSFs at the mRNA level, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In this gene set, disproportionately many genes were also <italic>T. brucei-specific</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), with no convincing above-background localisation observed in the PCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). We also observed a convincing fluorescent signal in BSFs for many in Set 2a (<italic>T. brucei</italic>-specific genes with no detectable PCF signal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Lack of fluorescent signal in the PCF tagging previously raised our suspicions that these genes may not be expressed in this life cycle stage, never expressed, or encode a non-functional, and therefore degraded, protein product. Similarly, failure to generate a PCF tagged cell line may indicate inaccurate sequence data for that locus or that the drug selectable marker cannot be expressed from that locus. This was an acute concern when the gene was <italic>T. brucei</italic> specific and therefore had no evidence from evolutionary conservation for being functional. Our BSF localisation provides evidence that many of these genes encode an expressed and likely functional protein (on the basis that the proteins often targeted to a specific organelle), supporting proteomic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. As would be expected, fluorescent signal in a tagged cell line therefore broadly correlates with mRNA abundance across life cycle stages and failure to observe a convincing localisation in PCFs is, as we previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], at least partially predictive of a stage specific protein expression.</p><p id="P9">With the exception of Set 2b, the set of <italic>T. brucei</italic> specific nuclear genes which were selected based on a specific PCF localisation, our BSF tagging was of proteins disproportionately more likely to have no detected signal from PCF tagging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, when a PCF localisation was available it was likely to be similar to the BSF localisation we observed, overall ˜85% were manually classified as similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). When dissimilar, the localisation observed in either the PCF or BSF was typically either a weak cytoplasmic signal or a cytoplasm, nuclear lumen and flagellar cytoplasm localisation. The former is simply background signal. The latter is the localisation we observed in PCFs for mNG when not fused to a protein, perhaps indicative that these dissimilarities are technical tagging failures or poorly tolerated fusion proteins – truncated or partially degraded leading to expression of effectively mNG alone. One, however, featured a clear change; see below.</p><p id="P10">For Set 1, the set of BSF upregulated genes, whether or not a PCF localisation was visible the BSF localisation gave a much stronger signal – detectable as we used the same microscope, camera and image processing settings for PCFs and BSFs, making signal intensity in the images approximately quantitative. This includes proteins known or expected to be BSF-upregulated: pyruvate transporter 1, PT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]; repressor of differentiation kinase 2, RDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]; flagellum adhesion protein 3, FLA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]; and cytoskeleton associated protein CAP5.5V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, it also includes many novel or uncharacterised proteins localising to many different organelles (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also noted one clear example where protein localisation differed between the PCF and BSF. Tb927.11.1230 and its syntenic ortholog Tb427tmp.47.0026 localised to the distal axoneme (occasionally with weak proximal signal) in PCFs and the entire axoneme in BSFs. Interestingly, this is comparable to the flagellar protein FLAM8 (flagellar member 8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P11">We noted that BSF-upregulated proteins often localised to membranous structures - the pellicular or flagellar membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum or the endocytic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We therefore tested for a bias in localisation annotation term usage relative to genome-wide usage in PCFs. Taking only the target genes for BSF tagging not selected based on a nuclear PCF localisation, i.e. excluding Set 2b, there was indeed a significant bias in term usage (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-30</sup>). Normalised fold-change in usage of annotation terms revealed a strongly disproportionately high usage of terms associated with the surface membrane and the endo/exocytic system (pellicular and flagellar membrane, ER and endocytic). There were also weaker biases in BSFs for 1) general (nucleus, nuclear lumen) rather than specific (nucleoplasm, nucleolus) nuclear localisation annotations, 2) fewer mitochondrion and kinetoplast annotations, 3) more glycosome terms, and 4) more flagellum tip and flagellar connector-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] annotation terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The BSF cell surface therefore has the greatest adaptation between BSFs and PCFs, with this change plausibly supported and/or maintained by changes in the ER and endocytic system.</p><p id="P12">The converse analysis, taking genes upregulated in the procyclic form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and analysing localisation annotation term usage relative to genome-wide usage in PCFs also revealed a significant change (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-30</sup>) in term usage, reflecting adaptation in the PCF. We identified 1) disproportionately high usage of mitochondrion and kinetoplast terms, 2) high usage of flagellar tip and flagellar connector terms, and 3) few glycosome terms. This speaks to the known upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial) relative to glycolysis (glycosomal) as the major ATP source in procyclic form and adaptation of the flagellum tip likely linked with new flagellum outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], but limited other changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In conclusion, we have mapped which organelles contain proteins upregulated in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF and PCF life cycle stages (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), thus mapping where the molecular machinery responsible for their stage-specific adaptations likely act in the cell. This includes many uncharacterised proteins with little or no bioinformatic insight into likely function. Lack of fluorescent signal by endogenous tagging in the PCF was often predictive of BSF expression, confirming the power of the TrypTag genome-wide protein localisation resource as a protein expression level resource. We also showed that it is likely that a large majority of <italic>T. brucei</italic> proteins, when expressed, have similar localisations in BSFs and PCFs – the dominant adaptive process therefore appears to be change in expression level rather than change in localisation. We suggest that this also likely applies to other life cycle stages and the different life cycle stages of other trypanosomatid parasites.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P14">Bloodstream form <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> strain Lister 427 pJ1339 was grown in HMI-9 at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], maintained in log phase growth and at less than ˜2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml by regular subculture.

This is an approximation for BSFs, as we do not know the genome-wide term usage in BSFs. Error was estimated using the standard error of proportion (SEP) for each annotation term.
