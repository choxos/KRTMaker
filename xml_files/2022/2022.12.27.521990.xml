This has put a significant part of the population at risk for severe disease and underscores the need for anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that are effective against emergent strains in vulnerable patients. Camelid nanobodies are attractive therapeutic candidates due to their high stability, ease of large-scale production and potential for delivery via inhalation. Here, we characterize the RBD-specific nanobody W25, which we previously isolated from an alpaca, and show superior neutralization activity towards Omicron lineage BA.1 in comparison to all other SARS-CoV2 variants. Structure analysis of W25 in complex with the SARS-CoV2 spike surface glycoprotein shows that W25 engages an RBD epitope not covered by any of the antibodies previously approved for emergency use. Furthermore, we show that W25 also binds the spike protein from the emerging, more infectious Omicron BA.2 lineage with picomolar affinity. <italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation of W25 prophylactic and therapeutic treatments across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant infection models, together with W25 biodistribution analysis in mice, demonstrates favorable pre-clinical properties. Together, these data endorse prioritization of W25 for further clinical development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since emergence in late 2019, the highly transmissible coronavirus—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—has infected more than 300 million individuals and claimed more than 6.5 million lives (WHO, updated September 2022). Despite the rapid development of vaccine strategies and preventive measures that help curb disease progression, viral transmission persists, and viral variants with altered virulence and antigenic sites have emerged in successive waves across the globe. Understanding the antigenic nature of emerging variants and the development of broad-spectrum therapeutics and vaccines remains an urgent priority.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 expresses a surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which consists of S1 and S2 subunits that form a homotrimeric viral spike which serves as both viral attachment protein and membrane fusogen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Cell receptor interaction is mediated by the S1 receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds the peptidase domain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Structural studies have revealed different conformations of the spike from both in vitro and in situ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In the prefusion stage, the RBD switches between a closed and an open conformation to facilitate hACE2 interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the S2 undergoes a substantial conformational change which drives the fusion of viral and cellular membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Investigations of sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients enabled isolation of potent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the majority of which target the RBD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Some of these have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for SARS-CoV2 treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis and have shown to be effective in treating certain patients with COVID-19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ww.fda.gov">https://ww.fda.gov</ext-link>). However, virus evolution causes ongoing emergence of novel SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoC), concomitant with reduction of vaccine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and therapeutic antibody efficacy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The latest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.529, designated Omicron (O), was first reported to WHO from South Africa at the end of November 2021 and is rapidly spreading across many countries, thereby replacing the already highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron accumulated a large number of mutations compared to its earlier pandemic variants, of which &gt;30 substitutions, deletions or insertions are located in the spike protein. Scientists all over the world are unanimously reporting significantly reduced efficacies of vaccine-elicited sera against Omicron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To best of our knowledge, the majority of potent monoclonal NAbs, including EUA NAbs, showed strongly reduced or no detectable neutralization activity towards Omicron. A notable exception is EUA NAb sotrovimab (S309), which however still exhibits 2-3-fold reduced neutralizing activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the identification of novel, potent anti-Omicron NAbs would be highly desirable to strengthen the therapeutic repertoire.</p><p id="P6">Nanobodies are considered the smallest antigen-binding entity, representing the variable heavy chain fragment (V<sub>H</sub>H) derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids (llamas, alpacas, guanacos, vicuñas, dromedary and camels). Because of their small size (2.5 nm by 4 nm; 12–15 kDa) and unique binding domains, nanobodies offer many advantages over conventional antibodies including the ability to bind cryptic epitopes not accessible to bulky conventional antibodies, high tissue permeability, ease of production, and thermostability. Due to their superior stability, nanobodies are highly suited for development as potential bio-inhaled therapies against respiratory diseases. ALX-0171, an inhaled anti–respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nanobody, demonstrated robust antiviral effect, reduced symptoms of virus infection in animal models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and displayed promising result in reducing RSV viral load <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We recently described the neutralizing RBD-specific nanobody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, W25, derived from an alpaca immunized with the S protein from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (Wuhan, Wu). Here, we extend these early findings and show that unlike all hitherto described NAbs, W25 neutralizes the Omicron variant even more potently than the ancestral isolate. In order to understand the molecular basis of neutralization activity and breadth of W25, we determined the cryo-EM structures of W25 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike from both ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2, revealing that the vast majority of mutations in the Omicron variant RBD are outside of the W25-RBD binding interface. In addition, W25-binding and live virus neutralization assays demonstrated activity against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Functional assays reveal that W25 triggers fusion, and that this mechanism is conserved across VOCs, including the less fusogenic Omicron variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate a protection and robust reduction of viral burden and prevention of lung pathology in the K18-human ACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 challenged with VOC Beta from both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of human IgG Fc-nanobody fusion, W25-Fc. Importantly, W25-Fc treatment results in survival of K18-human ACE2 mouse challenged with lethal dose of Beta SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we analyzed the pharmacodynamics of radiolabelled W25-Fc in mice to gain a better understanding of the pharmacological characteristics of W25-Fc to inform further drug development efforts.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>W25 ultra-potently neutralizes the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant</title><p id="P8">We have previously reported the neutralization activity of W25-Fc against SARS-CoV-2 Wu and D614G <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Given the number of substitutions in the Omicron BA.1 spike protein, including G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y and Y505H and BA.2 spike including G339D, S371F, S373P, S375F, T376A, D405N, R408S, K417N, N440K, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, N501Y and Y505H in the receptor binding domain, neutralisation activity of W25-Fc was tested against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 live virus on Vero E6 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Notably, W25-Fc completely and potently neutralised the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variant, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.45 nM ± 0.31 nM and 2.07 nM ± 0.66 nM, respectively which is ~7 fold more potent compared to the ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A, B and C</xref>). In comparison, EUA mAbs including REGN10933, REGN10987, LY-CoV555 and CT-P59 significantly or completely lost neutralising activity against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Other RBD-specific mAbs including CB6 and DH1047 displayed a significant reduction of neutralising activity against Omicron BA.1 variant, by ~4- and 7-fold compared to the Wu strain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b and c</xref>) and DH1047 completely lost neutralizing activity against BA.2. Interestingly, the neutralization profiles demonstrated that while W25-Fc exhibited complete inhibition of Wu-1 and Omicron infection, S309, a broadly neutralizing mAb, did not reach 100% neutralization, as seen previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structural analysis of W25 binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike</title><p id="P9">To gain mechanistic understanding of how W25 binds SARS-CoV-2 Wu and Omicron spikes, we determined their cryo-EM structures in complex with W25 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). After extensive 2D and 3D classification, two major conformational states of the Wu spike/W25 complex were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Class 1 spike trimers displayed two receptor-binding domains (RBD) in an upward-facing position, with the third one in “down”-position, while class 2 trimers possessed one “up”-RBD and two “down”-RBDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). For both classes, cryo-EM density maps showed additional density adjacent to the “up”-RBDs, not covered by the structural model of the spike trimer, strongly suggesting that these density portions correspond to W25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, upper panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>). For the Omicron spike/W25 complex, multiple rounds of 2D and 3D classification identified “3 down”, “2 up, 1 down” and “1 up, 2 down” RBD classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The latter state displayed clear extra density corresponding to W25 in similar position as for the Wu spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lower panel).</p><p id="P10">Focused refinement of the Wu and Omicron spike RBDs, the NTD regions of the adjoining spike protomer, and W25 resulted in contiguous density maps of sufficient quality for flexible fitting and refinement of a W25 structure model generated by AlphaFold2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1 and movie S1</xref>). W25 binds to the side and upper edge of the RBD, with the downward-facing side of W25 surrounded by N-linked glycans arising from spike protomer B NTD N122 and N165 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Since W25 positions relative to Wu or Omicron RBDs were equivalent, and the map quality and resolution of the Wu spike/W25 complex was slightly better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 and 3</xref>), the Wu spike/W25 model was subjected to further structural analysis. Superposition of the RBD/W25 complex structure with the Wu spike class 1 “down”-RBD indicates that W25 binding would lead to a slight overlap with the adjacent spike NTD, rationalizing why W25 preferentially binds to RBDs in the “up”-conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Detailed inspection of the RBD/W25 contact surface reveals an interface area of 847 Å<sup>2</sup> with mostly hydrophobic character, involving W25 β-sheet 3 CDR1 residues Y34, A35 and downstream amino acids H37, F39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, there are interfacing residues in the loop region connecting β-sheets 3 and 4, which include CDR2 (M41, R47, F49, F53, G54, N60, A62, Y61, A63, K66), and ultimately residues in β-sheet 7 (CDR3): H98, L100, L105-W111. From the RBD side, amino acid residues in an N-terminal loop region contribute to W25 binding (T345-S349, Y351, A352, N354), as well as from the loop downstream of β-sheet 3 (Y449-L452) and from a large loop preceding β-sheet 4 (R466, I468, T470-I472, G482-E484, F490, S494). In addition, there are hydrogen bonds between W25 side chains D109, W111 and RBD side chain S349 and the backbone carbonyl group of N450, respectively, as well as between RBD side chains N354, T470 and backbone carbonyls of W25 F53, L105. Twenty-two out of 23 epitope residues are conserved between Wu and Omicron. Only one interfacing residue is non-conservatively exchanged between Wu and Omicron SARS-CoV2 (E484A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b and movie 1</xref>.).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Comparison with RBD binding modes of other nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies and ACE2</title><p id="P12">In order to put the present structure analysis in context, PDB entries containing camelid or synthetic SARS-CoV2 specific nanobodies were collated and structurally aligned on their RBDs, together with the RBD/W25 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4c and Table S2</xref>). The vast majority of nanobodies either attach to one side of the RBD (“side-1” or cluster 1 in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>) or to the upper RBD surface (“top” or cluster 2). Two of the nanobodies bind to an RBD region opposite of cluster 1 (“side-2”). Interestingly, the W25 binding mode seems to incorporate characteristics of two of these clusters by occupying a surface area overlapping with epitopes of both “top” and “side-2” binders.</p><p id="P13">In addition, structures of the variable fragments of selected nABs, representing distinct RBD-binding modes (classes 1-4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, were superimposed on the W25/RBD complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). W25 partially overlaps with the VH fragment of class 2 NAb LY-CoV555, resulting in partially shared epitopes involving RBD amino acid residues 351, 449-453, and 480-490. Furthermore, W25 minimally clashes with loop regions of class 3 NAb S309 VH (residues 102-109) and VL (residue 94); their respective epitopes are adjacent but do not overlap.

Certain therapeutic antibody cocktails have been approved for post exposure treatment to reduce severe illness. However, the potency and breadth of protection by the majority of therapeutic antibodies are compromised by emerging SARS-CoV-2 immune escape mutations, underlining an urgent need for developing, preparing and improving antiviral avenues.</p><p id="P22">The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the rapid discovery of antiviral drugs. In this effort, a growing list of neutralising antibodies, nanobodies and synthetic antivirals have been developed using tools such as human/mouse B cells or immunised camelids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In contrast to conventional antibodies that require post-translation modifications from mammalian cells, nanobodies can be expressed in prokaryotic cells, hence, are cheaper to produce.

However, due to their low molecular weight, nanobodies may have very short half-lives in the bloodstream. Our work and previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> showed that dimerization via Fc-fusion significantly improved neutralisation potency, potentially through simultaneous engagement of two adjacent “up”-RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The majority of neutralizing antibodies raised against Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 are not effective against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. In this work, we demonstrate that W25 and W25-Fc display potent inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, as well as other VOCs including Alpha, Beta and Gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, e</xref>) in live virus neutralization assays. This is consistent with structure-based sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>), demonstrating that the majority of W25 residues involved in RBD binding are highly conserved across SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), with the exception of L452, which is centrally located in the binding interface. Neutralization of Kappa, Lambda and Delta variants by W25-Fc is strongly impeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). These variants share the L452R/Q mutation, which may lead to steric clashes with W25 residues F39 and/or W111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

This also suggests that W25 might not be effective against Omicron BA4/5. Unlike other antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, mutations at RBD position 484 (E484K/A/Q), presented on Beta, Gamma, Kappa and Omicron spike variants, do not impede the binding and neutralizing activity of W25. These mutations might be tolerated since E484 is only peripherally situated in the W25/RBD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). Intriguingly, W25, but not S309, retains a relatively high affinity to BA2.1 spike bearing mutation at amino acid 371 which is thought to be the key change due to introduction of a bulky phenylalanine side chain, causing loss of efficacy for several EUA mAbs and nanobodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. This is also in accordance with our structure analysis, showing no involvement of residue 371 in W25 binding. Additionally, recently emerged circulating strains of BA.2 derivatives (BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2) still retain the W25 key interacting residues, suggesting the neutralizing activity of W25 to these variants is retained.</p><p id="P24">Several SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies have been reported targeting NTD and S2 epitopes, the most effective antibody classes however appear to target the RBD due to its natural role in binding the human ACE2 receptor. Prior structural studies have classified these SARS-CoV2 NABs according to their RBD binding modes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Class 1 and 2 NABs obstruct the ACE2 binding site on top of the RBD. However, they are highly susceptible to VOC escape mutations including K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Classes 3 and 4 bind largely outside of the ACE2 interaction interface, to opposite surfaces on the side of the RBD. Our structure analysis showed that W25 targets a unique RBD epitope, partially overlapping with class 2 and 3 NABs, not affected by Omicron mutations. Accordingly, W25 might be suitable as therapeutic agent in combination with class 1 and/or 4 NABs to improve treatment efficacy against SARS-CoV2 Omicron strains or newly emerging VOCs.</p><p id="P25">Most N-glycosylation sites are highly conserved across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly in the NTD (N61, N122, N165 and N234). Our structural analysis found that W25 is surrounded by N-linked glycans at N122 and N165 from NTD of the neighboring spike protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, beyond its shielding function, N165 act as a molecular switch for RBD conformation by helping to maintain RBD in the ‘up’ or ACE2-accessible state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Accordingly, RBD/W25-interaction might interfere with these glycan-mediated RBD opening processes. In addition, the binding of a class 2 NAb, BD-23, is also facilitated by this glycan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">The mode of action of W25 in activating fusion mechanism may have clinical implications. Our structural analysis indicates that W25 only associates with RBD-up state and slightly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface. This is in line with our fusion assay demonstrating that W25 triggers fusion activity of transfected Spike protein in the presence of the cognate receptor ACE2 on the target cell population. Thus W25 may promote RBD-up conformation facilitating ACE2 engagement and enhance fusion. However, no infectivity enhancement was observed in authentic virus neutralization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>), thus W25 may trigger premature fusogenic conformational changes on spike leading to viral inactivation prior to cellular engagement. A similar mechanism has been reported for RBD specific mAbs including antibodies CR3022 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and S230 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and nanobodies such as VHH E, W and U <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. However, the mode of engagement of W25 to spike is unique to these previously reported binders, and incorporates the outward face of RBD and is largely non-overlapping with the ACE2 site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15</xref>). Interestingly, induction of fusion was reduced using the dimeric W25-Fc relative to the monomeric form, although dimeric W25-Fc showed increased antiviral activity, thus multiple modes of action may underpin the potency of W25.</p><p id="P27">In K18-hACE2 mouse model, W25-Fc administrated before infection provided full protection to all treated animals from a fatal SARS-CoV-2 challenge dose. Mice that received W25 prophylactic treatment exhibited no sickness and weight loss following the challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-e</xref>). Single-dose of therapeutic treatment of W25 after Beta and Omicron challenge provided improvement in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> to s). Interestingly, i.n. delivery of W25 conferred a better outcome compared to that of i.p. delivery This could be attributed to virus tropism where Omicron is reported to have higher replication in <italic>ex vivo</italic> bronchial epithelium as compared to other VOCs and Wu <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. This suggests that i.n. delivery of W25 may directly block the key infection site for Omicron. Nebulization, being more efficient at targeting the deep and local pulmonary structures could be tested for W25 efficacy in preclinical setting. W25 in combination with other Nbs could be used as novel cocktail treatment that could be rapidly generated to block virus mutational escape. Of note, the efficiency of delivery methods for each VOC may need to be considered and assessed.</p><p id="P28">We also recognize that there are some limitations in our present study.

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, with SARS-CoV-2 constantly evolving, prompting speculation that there will be new VOCs driving a resurgence of infections. Although vaccination remains the main measure against the pandemic, it is not effective in or possible for all patients.

After 2D classification, most defined classes with high-resolution features were retained (164.806 particles) and used for an ab-initio 3D reconstruction (3 classes, class similarity = 0). Particles were further processed using heterogeneous refinement and previously generated maps, followed by a re-assignment to both global conformations from the Wuhan data set (maps 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). A 3D variability analysis was performed for particles in 1 RBD-up, 2 RBD down conformation using a mask for the RBD in the “up” conformation.
