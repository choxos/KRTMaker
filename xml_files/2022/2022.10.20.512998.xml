DNA-binding proteins (DBPs), including transcription factors (TFs), act as key players in this regulatory network by binding to enhancers and bridging additional protein interactions between enhancers and promoters. In this work we define Enhancers-Promoter protein-protein Interaction Network (EPIN) as the local interactome connecting a single promoter with all its interacting enhancers. EPIN interactions are facilitated by various types of intermediate proteins, such as co-activators (e.g., mediators), chromatin structural proteins (e.g., cohesin), and noncoding RNA-binding proteins.</p><p id="P6">While protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been extensively studied <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, the integration of chromatin architecture information, specifically through chromosome conformation capture (3C-like) techniques, with PPI analysis is still in its early stages. Joint investigations of chromatin loops and PPIs are crucial for prioritizing functional interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, it is important to note that many of these studies often lack the necessary biological context at various levels.</p><p id="P7">As of today, the characterization of context specific intermediate PPIs involved in disease pathways and their association with DBPs remains largely unanswered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of disrupted E-P loops in several human disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In cancer, enhancers are frequently subject to sequence and structural variations, leading to the dysregulation of TFs and chromatin modifiers, which contribute to oncogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, targeting these enhancer-driven mechanisms holds great promise for therapeutic interventions in cases such as Prostate Cancer (PrCa) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In this context, advanced techniques such as HiC and its derivative HiChIP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, in combination with ChIP-seq, could enable the identification and characterization of specific chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. In particular, H3K27ac-HiChIP has emerged as a powerful tool designed to detect and amplify E-P interactions and has been successfully employed to uncover susceptibility genes associated with cancer, including PrCa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To characterize protein interactions that take place at the E-P contacts, we developed the Promoter-ENhancer-GUided Interaction Networks (PENGUIN) approach. For each promoter annotated in the genome and covered by at least one HiChIP interaction, PENGUIN builds an EPIN by integrating several sources of information: (1) high-resolution chromatin interaction maps enriched for a marker of active E-P activity (H3K27ac-HiChiP); (2) tissue-specific physical nuclear PPIs; (3) high-quality curated binding motifs of protein-DNA interactions; (4) tissue specific gene expression, used as a filter of protein data.</p><p id="P9">To prove the usefulness of our PENGUIN approach, we applied it to uncover EPINs in a PrCA cell line, androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP), and validate our findings in comparison to a benign prostate epithelial cell line (LHSAR). PrCa is the 2nd most common cancer in men <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Its distinct hormone-dependent nature is characterized by high expression and frequent genetic amplification of <italic>AR</italic>. AR is a regulator of homeostasis and proteases transcription, such as <italic>KLK3</italic> encoding PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen). <italic>AR</italic> gene is also a principal therapeutically targeted oncogene in PrCa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Increased genetic instability resulting in chromosomal rearrangements and high frequency of mutations are deemed indicative of PrCa aggressiveness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> for which there is need of <italic>ad hoc</italic> treatments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Recurrent mutations in <italic>FOXA1</italic>, involved in prostate organogenesis and regulator of <italic>AR</italic> transcription, have been observed in several populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Hundreds of PrCa-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including genomic regions within tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, such as <italic>MYC</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, the functional relationship between most of these SNPs and PrCa pathophysiology is unknown. This missing part of the picture, together with the growing evidence of abnormal transcriptional programs driven by genetic instability, led us to investigate the role of chromatin architecture in PrCa. In particular, we focused on the nuclear proteins potentially involved in transcriptional regulation through the interaction of promoters and non-coding regulatory elements, enhancers.</p><p id="P10">By clustering together promoters with similar EPIN structures, PENGUIN identified 273 promoters whose genes are enriched in PrCa fine-mapped SNPs, known PrCa oncogenes, and ChIP-Seq-validated binding sites of transcriptional repressor CTCF. The proteins that populate such EPINs constitute putative PrCa-related factors, some of which have not been previously described to be associated with PrCa SNPs or oncogenes. Moreover, the EPINs detected by PENGUIN enable the characterization of distinct molecular cascades enriched in PrCa SNPs at E-P contacts. These represent new potential molecular targets in PrCa that cannot be identified through conventional analytical procedures, such as E-P contacts and GWAS overlap. To explore our results we made a dedicated server available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://penguin.life.bsc.es/">https://penguin.life.bsc.es/</ext-link>.</p><p id="P11">Our methodology, focussing at the specific EPIN resolution level, reveals a new relation between 3D genome conformation and disease phenotype. This new relation allows PENGUIN to propose new directions in the molecular characterization of chromatin interactions as well as in the definition of potential targets for molecular screening towards disease treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The PENGUIN framework</title><p id="P12">PENGUIN builds EPINs by leveraging multiple sources of information. Specifically, it integrates diverse datasets, including (1) high-resolution chromatin interaction maps that capture active promoter-enhancer interactions, highlighting the dynamic nature of gene regulation; (2) tissue-specific physical nuclear protein-protein interactions (PPIs), enabling the exploration of the intricate molecular associations within the nucleus; (3) curated binding motifs of protein-DNA interactions, providing insights into the specific interactions between proteins and DNA and (4) gene expression levels, identifying active elements with the interaction networks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). With this comprehensive approach, PENGUIN reconstructs EPINs by clustering enhancers that interact with the same promoter based on PPIs. Each EPIN consists of three distinct types of nodes: promoter-bound nodes, encompassing proteins with DNA binding motifs present in the promoter region; enhancer-bound nodes, comprising proteins with DNA binding motifs in the enhancer sequences; and intermediate nodes, representing proteins that interact with either the promoter-bound or enhancer-bound nodes but lack direct DNA binding motifs on the promoter or enhancers. By integrating these diverse nodes, PENGUIN provides a holistic view of the intricate molecular landscape within EPINs. This approach enables the exploration of the interplay between DNA-binding proteins, enhancers, and intermediate proteins, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms that shape gene expression and ultimately influence cellular functions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PENGUIN identifies PrCa clusters of protein interactions based on chromatin contacts</title><p id="P13">We leveraged 24,547 E-P contacts (30,416 after refinement and prioritization, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref></bold>) identified using H3K27ac-HiChIP data in LNCaP, 810 binding motifs from 639 DNA-binding proteins, and 31,944 prostate-specific, experimentally validated, physical and nuclear PPIs (filtering out proteins from unexpressed genes, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref></bold>) to construct 4,314 EPINs using the PENGUIN clustering approach outlined in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). Each EPIN is centered around one promoter that we found to be contacted by a median of 4 enhancers, with a maximum of 93 enhancers for the promoter of the gene <italic>CRNDE</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref></bold>). Altogether, the 4,314 EPINs contain a total of 8,215 interactions (edges) among a total of 885 proteins (nodes) that are expressed in LNCaP (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). A mean of 36% proteins found in these EPINs are encoded by differentially expressed genes in LNCaP versus LHSAR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P14">Overall, 751 out of the 885 proteins represent intermediate nodes, with 127 of them acting both as intermediate and as DNA-bound nodes in different EPINs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref></bold>). 261 unique DNA-binding proteins have predicted binding sites in at least one of the anchors of enhancers and promoters. A mean of 32.8 (s.d. 11.5) distinct DBPs were identified per promoter anchor with SP1, EGR1, SP2 being the most represented; and a mean of 24.8 (s.d. 7.69) were predicted per enhancer anchor with SP1, IRF1 and TFAP2A being the most represented.</p><p id="P15">A mean of 1.43 (normalized) promoters (0.88 s.d.) are shared among enhancers, with a maximum of 15 promoters for the same enhancer. To identify communalities and differences among the 4,314 EPINs in LNCaP, we performed an unsupervised, hierarchical clustering based on edge composition (Ward’s linkage method, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). Using this approach, we identified 8 clusters of promoters with specific networks (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref></bold>,<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref></bold>).The decision to divide the hierarchical tree into 8 clusters was based on the analysis of cluster characteristics, achieved by varying the number of clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterization of PrCa clusters identified by PENGUIN</title><p id="P16">We characterized the 8 clusters using PrCa specific annotations. We used the previously described 95% credible set of SNPs (henceforth referred to as PrCa SNPs) across 137 PrCa-associated regions fine-mapped from the largest publicly available GWAS summary statistics (N=79,148 cases and 61,106 controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>). By comparing each cluster with all other clusters, we found a significant enrichment of PrCa SNPs in one specific cluster (cluster 8 or <italic>GWAS+ cluster</italic>; two-sided Fisher’s exact test, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). Interestingly this enrichment is exclusively due to SNPs in enhancers (<bold><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Our results show that E-P interactions containing PrCa SNPs are clustered together (red branches in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>) indicating that they have similar characteristics in the way their PPI networks are wired. We found that most pairwise interactions (67.5%, or 5,550 out of 8,215 edges) are found in all clusters but establishing different topologies.</p><p id="P17">We identified the protein interactions that are enriched in each cluster and estimated the significance of overrepresentation of each edge in a cluster compared to all others (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). <italic>GWAS+ cluster</italic> (cluster 8 in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref></bold>) exhibits the lowest number of promoters and distinctive network characteristics (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref></bold>). Nonetheless, per promoter, it displays the largest number of edges (p-value &lt; 1e-16) and intermediate nodes (p-value &lt; 1e-16), in line with its greater number of enhancers per promoter (p-value &lt; 1e-16), see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref></bold>.</p><p id="P18">We then assessed whether PENGUIN clustering was influenced by super-enhancer-like regions sharing target promoters in given clusters. Although the distribution of enhancers per hotspots is similar among our 8 clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4G</xref></bold>), the <italic>GWAS+ cluster</italic> has fewer single enhancers (enhancer at more than 15 kb from any other enhancer). The average number of promoters targeted by each hotspot for all our 3,752 defined enhancer hotspots was 1.83 promoters targeted per hotspot. When measured considering only the promoters in given EPIN clusters, the values were: 1.29 for cluster 1, 1.28 for cluster 2, 1.25 for cluster 3, 1.24 for cluster 4, 1.22 for cluster 5, 1.21 for cluster 6, 1.34 for cluster 7 and 1.27 for cluster 8. In this case, values were very similar between EPIN clusters.</p><p id="P19">Moreover, the EPINs of the GWAS+ cluster have the lowest values of node-level centrality measures, namely betweenness and degree (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref></bold>). The degree of a node measures the amount of connections it has, while the betweenness centrality measures the amounts of shortest paths that pass through it. Low values of betweenness and degree indicate a lower amount of connections among different nodes of the network. Betweenness and degree are significantly different across clusters (Kruskall-Wallis test p-value &lt; 1e-16), but not with respect to the ensemble of all EPINs, which indicates that, despite the high number of shared pairwise interactions (67.5% of edges), the wiring of the cluster-specific EPINs are distinctive.</p><p id="P20">Since CTCF is a major actor in the formation and maintenance of transcriptionally productive E-P interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we tested the clusters identified by PENGUIN for enrichment in CTCF binding. For this analysis we used CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, from the same cell line (LNCaP), from the ENCODE project instead of predictions based on DNA-binding motifs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). We found that the enriched interactions with CTCF peaks, that we call <italic>CTCF+,</italic> cluster together (red branches in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref></bold>), suggesting that the presence of CTCF in chromatin interactions results in the formation of characteristic PPI networks between the promoter and its enhancers.</p><p id="P21">CTCF+ clusters overlap the GWAS+ cluster (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref></bold>), suggesting that CTCF-mediated interactions could be more functionally relevant to PrCa. In particular, GWAS+ cluster (representing 6% of the total number of promoters considered) is the only one presenting the unique and significant enrichment in CTCF binding, PrCa SNPs, and oncogenes coincidentally (<bold><xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5</xref></bold>). This cluster is enriched in the <italic>Hippo signaling pathway</italic> (KEGG:04390) (Bonferroni-corrected p-value=1.56e-3), <italic>WNT Signaling Pathway</italic> (KEGG:04310) (Bonferroni-corrected p-value=9.57e-3) and <italic>Pathways in cancer</italic> (KEGG:05200) with genes such as <italic>BCL2L1, MYC, FOS</italic> (Bonferroni-corrected p-value = 0.047) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref></bold>). Interestingly GWAS+ cluster, or any other cluster, did not significantly stand out in terms of overall expression level (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref></bold>) or, notably, in terms of fraction of differentially expressed genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P22">To explore the potential connection between our clustering approach and the presence of trans-eQTLs, we used the trans-eQTLs reported from the largest eQTL study available (large-scale meta-analysis in up to 31,684 blood samples from 37 eQTLGen Consortium cohorts in Whole Blood, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>) and defined a region an ‘eQTL hotspot’ when associated to more than 3 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). We observed an enrichment of eQTL hotspots across all clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5SE</xref></bold>, empirical p-value &lt;0.0001), but not specifically for cluster PrCA GWAS+ (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5SF</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P23">In conclusion, PENGUIN enabled the identification of a cluster of E-P contacts whose EPINs are uniquely enriched in PrCa SNPs, ChIP-seq CTCF peaks, and oncogenes (a.k.a. GWAS+ cluster or cluster 8, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). It should be emphasized that our findings demonstrate consistent results also when employing PrCa-associated SNPs from the GWAS catalog, in which case we also identified cluster 8 as significantly enriched (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Baseline comparisons and assessment of PENGUIN specificity</title><p id="P24">Among the 273 promoters belonging to the identified GWAS+ cluster (cluster 8 in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>), 11 belong to known oncogenes, <italic>FOXA1, ZFHX3, CDKN1B, KDM6A, BRCA2, CDH1, CCND1, NKX3-1, BAG4, MYC, GATA2</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). We compared enrichment of PrCa functional annotations in the reconstructed networks with and without inclusion of intermediate proteins. Including intermediate proteins allows increasing the number of retrieved PrCa-related oncogenes in GWAS+ cluster from 6 to 11 and increasing significance of enrichment indicating improved specificity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref></bold>). We then compared our results with the simple overlap of the genomic regions of E-P contacts and known oncogene promoters [see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref></bold>, which also reports on the overlaps of E-P contacts with CTCF peaks (in both enhancers and promoters, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>), and PrCa SNPs (in enhancers)]. In this scenario, only 30 promoters (12 overlapping the GWAS+ cluster) would be identified that overlap both PrCa SNPs and CTCF peaks. Of these, just 3 are promoters of known oncogenes (and only one, <italic>ZMYM3</italic>, is not in the GWAS+ cluster).</p><p id="P25">To explore the cell and disease-specificity of our results we applied PENGUIN on LHSAR, a benign prostate epithelial cell line. We performed H3K27Ac HiChIP experimental data and applied the PPI clustering procedure to explore functional relationships within the clusters. We then proceeded to apply PENGUIN to identify clusters of EPINs based on their edges (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref></bold>). As the selection of an exact number of clusters in a given tree could be considered an important variable in our analysis, we examined various cluster numbers (4, 8, 16). We investigated the presence of cluster enrichment in GWAS and CTCF (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3B</xref></bold>). Our analysis did not reveal any cluster enrichment in GWAS and CTCF within the benign prostate control LHSAR. Moreover, we did not observe a significant increase in the number of identified oncogenes in LHSAR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). These results lead us to conclude that PENGUIN, along with the integration of intermediate PPI networks, significantly enhances the identification of candidate PrCa-related SNPs affecting key elements in chromatin architecture.</p><p id="P26">Despite the high similarity in PPIs between LHSAR and LNCaP cells (Jaccard index of 0.85), their clustering based on H3K27Ac HiChIP data revealed distinct EPINs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). This finding highlights the sensitivity of our method in capturing subtle differences within EPINs. To further validate this, we conducted additional statistical analyses on PPIs across different cancer cell types. By examining the overlap between PPI networks, we discovered significant variations that were highly specific to each cell type (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref></bold>).

Our assumption is grounded in earlier research that has demonstrated the correlation between 3D loop topology and chromatin state or gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We propose PENGUIN as a molecular approach to study variations in structural characteristics of chromatin loops, establishing a direct link to disease-related phenomena. By integrating the PPI network information, the method offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these distinctive features and their relevance to disease progression.</p><p id="P44">Previous approaches have already incorporated PPI networks with GWAS hits to enhance their analysis. For instance, Ratnakumar et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> identified proteins that exhibited an enrichment of PPIs with GWAS hits. In a recent study, Dey et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> demonstrated the benefits of employing strategies that capture both distal and proximal gene regulation in prioritizing disease-related genes. In addition, alternative methods have amalgamated information from 3D chromatin interactions and GWAS SNPs to establish connections between intergenic SNPs and gene regulation in cancer contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. These approaches have contributed to unraveling the relationship between genetic variations, chromatin organization, and disease. In contrast, our method takes a unique approach by being completely agnostic to the presence of SNPs. It combines information from PPI networks and enhancer-promoter interactions derived from H3K27ac-HiChIP data within a unified framework. This integrative approach allows us to leverage both the protein interaction landscape and the regulatory interactions between enhancers and promoters, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease.</p><p id="P45">By utilizing PPI networks, we were able to reveal a distinct set of genes associated with PrCa that would have remained undiscovered using other methods. Notably, the intermediate nodes within this PPI network possess intrinsic properties that can be leveraged for the classification and characterization of E-P chromatin loops. Thus, our study demonstrates the capability of PENGUIN to group genes based on their involvement in PrCa, even in the absence of any prior information. This breakthrough opens up an uncharted avenue towards comprehending and identifying unsuspected biological markers in disease. In particular, the genes identified within the cluster exhibiting the highest enrichment in SNPs associated with PrCa (the GWAS+ cluster) can be considered promising candidate oncogenes or potential partners of oncogenes. It is conceivable that these genes may share "onco-enhancers," which are enhancers contributing to tumorigenic activity. For instance, PENGUIN can be used to identify <italic>trans-</italic>acting factors (e.g., interaction cascades of TFs and chromatin regulators) that could be targeted by drugs, or <italic>cis-</italic>acting factors (e.g., DBPs with binding motifs in regulatory elements) whose DNA binding affinity could be modified through knock-outs via CRISPR for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, unlike traditional TF enrichment analysis which detects general enrichments of particular proteins, PENGUIN can help identify the specific protein cascade potentially disrupted at enhancer loci for the disease under study. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of PENGUIN in unveiling previously unknown gene networks and provide valuable insights into the identification and characterization of biomarkers in various diseases, including PrCa.</p><p id="P46">To validate our findings, we have used cell-line specific datasets, androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP) or a normal prostate epithelial cell-line (LHSAR). Each of the sources of information could be directly or indirectly related to the specific cell-lines used in this study: (1) H3K27ac-HiChiP in LNCaP and in LHSAR, (2) prostate-specific PPIs and (3) DNA binding motifs extracted from publicly-available datasets but filtered by our cell-type specific interacting 1 kb promoter-enhancer regions and (4) gene expression on cell-line for filtering PPI networks. The comparison of the results in cancer cell-line (LNCaP) to the results in a benign cell line (LHSAR) support our PrCa cell-specific findings. In LHSAR we found a significant association between the obtained clusters and the presence of CTCF, pointing towards the correct classification of EPINs into biologically relevant categories. But, this same clustering in the benign LHSAR cell-line did not reveal any association to PrCA, neither at the level of PrCa-SNPs, nor at the level of specific oncogenes. Future analyses could explore the use of clustering E-P loops with PENGUIN using other methods and sources for each of these layers. For example, we have used as input enhancer-promoter loops cell-specific H3K27Ac HiChIP experiments (strict calling of loops and prioritization), to maximize our true positives in the input data. The input for the PENGUIN clustering approach can also be constituted by enhancer-promoter links measured from other experimental methods aside from HiChIP or even using computational methods. We leave this for subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P47">In this work, we use a targeted approach and use the information on association of SNPs from fine-mapping as an annotation to our clusters. Specifically, we identify potential SNP paths from defined PrCa associated regions. SNP paths link genes in a network through a path that either starts from TF binding sites in enhancers or passes through proteins from the intermediate EPIN network that would have SNP in their gene bodies. This approach adds a new dimension in the contextualization of GWAS-associated SNPs using the EPIN looping realm.</p><p id="P48">It is important to mention our primary objective was to shed light on specific links that could be disrupted by PrCa-predisposing variants, such as CTCF bindings that connect promoters to their enhancers, or intermediate structural proteins that play a role in the E-P network. Further investigation is required to gain a comprehensive understanding of the biology and mechanisms underlying these crucial links. For this purpose, and to facilitate the exploration of SNP pathways associated with prostate cancer, we developed a user-friendly web interface accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://penguin.life.bsc.es/">https://penguin.life.bsc.es/</ext-link>. This platform serves as a tool for convenient investigation into the pathways influenced by SNPs in the context of prostate cancer. It is also intriguing to observe that, while PENGUIN successfully identifies clusters of EPINs significantly associated with PrCA, the gene expression analysis did not reveal any significant trends. At first glance, this observation may appear contradictory to our definitions of EPIN clusters and the core concept of EPIN itself. However, considering the evidence presented by our analysis, we believe that PENGUIN enables the detection of cancer associations with heightened sensitivity compared to traditional differential expression analyses. The ability of PENGUIN to capture intricate associations between EPINs and cancer surpasses the limitations of relying solely on gene expression changes, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development and progression.</p><p id="P49">Our analysis comes with some caveats to keep in mind. Firstly, we relied on data from the HiChIP technique for capturing enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions, protein-DNA interactions from FIMO, and tissue-specific protein-protein interactions from the integrated interactions database (IID). The comprehensiveness of these datasets is inherently limited by the scope and constraints of the underlying databases and methodologies employed. Furthermore, our approach focuses on networks involving proteins with known edges, resulting in a consideration of only those proteins. Additionally, for the purpose of visualization, we have condensed the number of reported proteins and have presented only one intermediate protein (expanded one edge away). Moreover, it is worth mentioning that our study focuses on E-P interactions within a stable environment (LNCaP cells), representing a snapshot in time. While this field is still undergoing active research and further exploration, existing literature suggests that E-P interactions can exhibit minimal and quantitatively small changes in these conditions. Thus, while interpreting our findings, it is essential to consider the limitations of the utilized databases and methodologies, the specific protein selection, the condensed visualization approach, and the stable cellular context in which the E-P interactions were examined.</p><p id="P50">In conclusion, the PENGUIN approach employed in this study to investigate PrCa in LNCaP cells has the potential to be applied to the study of other human diseases, given the availability of similar data. This approach can be extended to explore different scenarios, such as different cell types or combinations of GWAS data, offering a promising avenue for future investigations. For instance, utilizing E-P dataset from another prostate cancer cell line would allow the identification of target genes regulated by enhancers from diverse cell types. These target genes can be prioritized using a genome-wide collection of disease-specific risk SNPs. The networks generated by PENGUIN provide a molecular understanding of the associations involved in cancer-related chromatin dynamics, making them well-suited for training advanced machine learning models like graph neural networks (GNNs). We propose potential intermediates in PrCa that engage in E-P networks within cancer cells and present opportunities for therapeutic intervention. High-throughput functional studies could validate the impact of genetic perturbations on thousands of enhancers simultaneously. As shown in our analysis, leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 technology would enable precise editing of specific genomic regions, facilitating targeted investigations and further elucidating the functional consequences of these genetic perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Conformation capture and E-P interactions</title><p id="P51">We used Hi-C followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) targeting H3K27Ac in LNCaP cells (androgen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma cell line) across 5 biological replicates including 1 billion reads as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As a comparison, we also performed H3K27Ac HiChIP on LHSAR (Prostate epithelial cells overexpressing androgen receptor), across three replicates including 309 million reads.

We used q-value &lt; 0.01 and a 5 kb resolution and considered only interactions between 5 kb and 3 Mb as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In this analysis, we restricted to a stringent global background estimation to reduce as much as possible the number of false-positive interactions. The corresponding FitHiChIP specifications used were “IntType=3” (the peak-to-all) for the foreground, meaning at least one anchor to be in the H3K27 peak, and “UseP2PBackgrnd=1” (the peak-to-peak (stringent)) for the global background estimation of expected counts and contact probabilities for each genomic distance for learning the background and spline fitting. We identified 49,565 significant interactions (FitHiChIP, FDR&lt;0.01) for LNCaP, and 12,053 for LHSAR.</p><p id="P52">We categorized interactions by overlapping anchors with transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancers identified by H3K27ac ChIP-seq as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Briefly, we first extended anchors by 5 kb on either side; we defined promoter regions around the TSS (+/- 500 bases) using RefSeq hg19 (see <bold>Data Availability</bold>); we defined enhancer regions using regions from H3K27ac ChipSeq in the same cell. Specifically, these were 49,638 and 53,561 enhancer regions, respectively from H3K27ac LNCaP in regular media (union of narrow and broad peaks) and from H3K27ac LHSAR. We note that the enhancer anchors at this stage of the analysis are of length 15 kb, due to 5 kb resolution of the HiChIP data analysis and additional 5 kb padding added to anchors on either side. We labeled the promoters and enhancer regions that overlap either right or left anchors, and considered E-P if only one anchor overlaps a promoter and the other an enhancer region. For LNCaP, out of the 49,565 significant interactions, we considered 18,151 E-P interactions. For LHSAR, out of the 12,052 significant interactions, we considered 5,435 E-P interactions. It is important to emphasize that our study relies solely on enhancers defined by our own HiChIP experiments, rather than relying on annotated enhancers or external definitions from ENCODE. We further prioritized E-P interactions to 1 kb regions and discarded from enhancers the 1 kb bins with fewer HiChIP interactions with the promoter (see <italic>E-P HiChIP prioritization</italic> section). We obtain 30,416 and 4,497 E-P interactions of 1 kb each for LNCaP and LHSAR respectively. The 15 kb original E-P interactions dataset contained a mean of 1.6 (1.3 s.d.) promoter anchors per enhancer anchor (after prioritization of enhancer anchor to 1 kb region, mean of 1.4 (0.9 s.d.) promoters per enhancer). There were 11,127 (17,683 prioritized 1 kb regions) enhancer anchors in total; 7,341 (12,385 prioritized 1 kb regions) enhancer anchors are contacted by one promoter anchor with a maximum of 21 promoter anchors (15 using prioritized enhancer regions) sharing the same enhancer.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>E-P HiChIP prioritization</title><p id="P53">In order to reduce experimental artifacts in the context of our EPINs, we developed a specific prioritization method. This prioritization start by normalizing the data assuming, as most used capture-C normalizations (ICE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, Vanilla, or KR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>) that all biases (e.g. GC content, number of restriction sites, mappability, or in the case of HiChIP, immunoprecipitation bias) can be corrected together. For this normalization step, we assume that there is a specific bias per any 1 kb genomic loci (L<sub>x</sub> for loci x; see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref></bold>). This bias causes the difference between a theoretical expected number of interactions (E<sub>XY</sub> between loci <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>) and the observed number of interactions (O<sub>XY</sub> between loci <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>). In this representation we can define a system of 9 equations involving three 1 kb loci in the promoter (exactly from TSS -1 kb to TSS +2 kb) and fifteen 1 kb loci on the enhancer side. This system of equations is then solved using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The procedure is repeated in an overlapping window manner along the 15 kb of the enhancer, always against the target 1 kb of the promoter and its two 1 kb neighboring loci. Before the normalization step, we observed a different interaction pattern for interactions below 10 kb (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref></bold>) due, in part, to the contiguity of restriction-enzyme fragments or chromatin persistence length. As these interactions may also be a source of bias in the construction of a PPI network, we removed them from our study. We applied the normalization to the remaining interactions and observed a better correlation between genomic distance and interaction count (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P54">In order to compare with standard normalization procedure we applied the ICE normalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> to our dataset (using TADbit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> 1 kb resolution; filtering bins with less than 100 di-tags - 75% of the genome lost even using a threshold 10 times below the recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>). Because of the sparsity of the genomic matrix the normalization did not fully converge (ICE was not able to completely balance the average di-tag counts per bin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>). Next we applied the following normalization to our loops dataset, with few modification in order to rescue as much signal as possible: 1-in the promoter site, as our definition of promoter is exact (TSS to TSS +1 kb), we corrected using the average of the two bins spanning over this 1 kb region 2-on the enhancer site, as most of the 1 kb loci were excluded by the normalization filter we also averaged the ICE bias over the whole region. Even with these modifications, only half the original data was recovered. However the correlation between genomic distance and number of interactions was significantly improved with respect to raw data. Overall, the correlation value observed with ICE was similar to the one measured for our normalization (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref></bold>). We believe however that, for this dataset and for our methodology, our normalization procedure represents an improvement as it considers the exact promoter regions (not partially overlapping 1 kb bins) and minimizes the loss of promoter-enhancer data.</p><p id="P55">The normalized profile of interactions was finally used to prioritize most interacting 1 kb loci on the 15 kb enhancer (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref></bold>).

DE analysis on prostate cancer tumor versus normal was downloaded from GEPIA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#degenes">http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#degenes</ext-link>, which use the TCGA and GTEx projects databases to compare gene expression between tumor and normal tissues under Limma, both under and over expressed. We used the default thresholds of log2FC of 1 and qvalue cut-off of 0.01. These data covered 84 out of 885 genes encoding for intermediates in PENGUIN and 413 out of 4,314 promoter EPINs. DE analysis of RNA-Seq on LHSAR (an immortalized prostate epithelial line overexpressing androgen receptor) versus LNCaP was performed as previously described. Briefly, RNA-seq data were processed using the VIPER pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome built with STAR. FPKM values were calculated with Cufflinks for 20,114 RefSEQ genes included in the VIPER repository. Differential expression analysis was performed with the DESeq2 R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. 15,650 genes with DE data covered 884 of the 885 genes encoding for intermediates in PENGUIN and 3,286 genes out of 4,314 promoter EPINs.</p><p id="P88">We annotated whether the EPIN promoters themselves and the genes encoding the intermediate proteins in our data were DE using either of the two databases. We considered as DE those genes passing |log2 fold change| &gt; 1 and adjusted p-value &lt;= 0.01. For the LNCAP/LHSAR dataset, we could compute a Fisher test of enrichment of differentially expressed genes encoding for intermediate proteins within each EPIN promoter versus within the SNP paths (we could not compute this for the GEPIA since we did not have the full dataset of covered genes). The genes that were not passing these filters were considered non-DE and the genes not covered by the two datasets were excluded from the enrichment analysis described next. For each EPIN we calculated the fraction of DE intermediates within the SNP paths and we estimated the enrichment of those compared to the fraction of DE intermediates in the full EPIN network.</p><p id="P89">To find the enrichment of DE genes in SNP paths (PrCa SNPs in intermediate proteins) compared to those in the entire EPIN, we computed as enrichment the ratio of Fraction1 / Fraction2, where:</p><p id="P90">Fraction1 = (number of DE intermediates within SNP paths) / (number of covered intermediates within SNP paths), and</p><p id="P91">Fraction2 = (number of DE intermediates the EPIN) / (number of covered intermediates in the EPIN).</p><p id="P92">We report the EPIN genes passing enrichment (“<bold>enrichment_DE_deseq_SNP.bs.DBP.path</bold>”) &gt; 1.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>pQTL look-up</title><p id="P93">We downloaded summary statistics with genome-wide association between SNPs and 4907 proteins reported in the deCODE study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> and annotated with pQTL association the SNPs we identified falling either in enhancer binding sites or in node genomic locations.

in LNCaP or LHSAR cell lines), tissue-specific nuclear protein-protein interactions, PPIs (in this work, cancer and normal prostate PPIs from IID database), curated DNA-binding motifs (in this work, motifs from JASPAR database), and gene expression profiles (in this work, RNA-sequencing data in LNCaP or LHSAR cell line). PENGUIN output consists of Enhancer-Promoter protein-protein Interaction Networks (EPINs). Downstream analyses are designed to address specific questions related to prostate cancer (PrCa), namely the identification of clusters of promoters based on EPIN similarity, their enrichment in distinct annotations (CTCF binding from ChIP-seq peaks, PrCa-associated SNPs, and PrCa oncogenes), and finally the formulation of mechanistic hypothesis based on SNPs path analysis. In the inset, we report a schematic representation of an enhancer-promoter protein-protein interaction network (EPIN) reconstructed with PENGUIN for a given E-P contact detected by H3K27ac-HiChIP. Promoter and enhancer DNA binding motifs found in HiChIP regions after enhancer prioritization and the corresponding bound proteins are indicated in orange; their physical interactions with other factors of the EPIN (in gray) are represented as gray lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156214-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Clustering of the promoters originating the PENGUIN reconstructed EPINs.</title><p>Clustering is based on edge composition of the EPINs.
