However, the resulting spatial resolution of most unsupervised array-based techniques precludes single cell analyses, while imaging-based techniques require prior knowledge for targeted panel assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, existing methods cannot simultaneously probe the entire transcriptome of multiple tissue microenvironments at single cell resolution. Here, we introduce sphere-sequencing (sphere-seq), a novel method to enable the transcriptomic characterization of single cells within spatially distinct tissue niches.</p><p id="P3">Previously reported comparable methods, such as Paired-cell sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, PIC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and Clump-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, analyze spatial communities of 2-10 cells together in bulk and therefore lack single cell resolution. Computational deconvolution can be applied to such datasets to approximate single cell transcriptomes, but this process is inherently imprecise, especially for genes that are co-expressed in multiple cells. Sphere-seq refines these approaches and achieves single cell resolution while simultaneously capturing larger communities of cells that reflect biologically relevant tissue microenvironments. Importantly, this enabled us to predict ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions which are not only significantly enriched in a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, but actually spatially co-occur in specific microenvironments.</p><p id="P4">Sphere-seq is based on partial tissue dissociation followed by size-dependent sorting of individual Ø 200-450 μm cellular communities (spheres) with a large fragment biosorter into a 96 well plate; one sphere per well. Subsequently, spheres are dissociated into single cells within each well and hashed with a sphere-specific lipid-tagging barcode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> to preserve information about a cell's neighborhood prior to pooling for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A species-mixing experiment indicated that 95% of cells are correctly assigned to their sphere of origin, confirming the validity of our approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-d</xref>). We used sphere-seq to dissect spatially distinct niches in the metastasis-bearing mouse liver. The liver is characterized by a spatially repetitive organization into hexagonal hepatic lobules, in which blood flows from portal to central veins through sinusoids flanked by linear cords of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Differential oxygen and nutrient availability along the central-portal axis imprints zonation of cell functions and gene expression patterns in liver resident cells, particularly in hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells (LECs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, multiple studies have reported zonation of immune cells, including liver-resident macrophages called Kupffer cells (KCs), T and NKT cells, which were all found to be periportally enriched<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanisms of immune zonation and how it affects inflammatory responses or metastatic seeding are still to be investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sphere-sequencing reveals previously uncharacterized gene zonation in the metastasis-bearing mouse liver</title><p id="P5">We applied sphere-seq to mouse liver samples harvested two weeks after intrasplenic injection of colon cancer organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Resulting single cell transcriptomes were annotated using known marker genes from the liver cell atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, assigned to their sphere of origin, and different cell type proportions per sphere were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-c</xref>). We used a previously identified LEC zonation-specific gene expression signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> to reconstruct the spatial origin of each sphere along the central-portal axis (lobule layers L1-L10). The accuracy of the reconstruction was corroborated by zonated gene expression in hepatocytes from pericentral and periportal spheres which matched previously published landmark genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). This spatial ordering allowed us to characterize genes in LECs that were not reported as zonated in the reference dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Some of the identified zonated genes could be verified in healthy mouse liver and are therefore likely involved in homeostatic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). For example <italic>Plpp1</italic>, a phospholipid phosphatase, is centrally zonated, implying a link to pericentral lipogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> while <italic>Galnt15</italic>, putatively involved in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, is portally zonated, which is in accordance with periportal gluconeogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Next, we designed a 100 gene panel for highly-multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH, Molecular Cartography) which included marker genes for key cell types, as well as genes that displayed a spatially differentiated expression in sphere-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a-d</xref>). This validated zonation patterns of metabolic genes in LECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Sphere-seq furthermore permitted the investigation of zonated genes in other cell types after assigning a sphere to periportal or pericentral zones according to LEC gene expression patterns. For example, <italic>Vcam1</italic> was found to be enriched in periportal KCs, which could be independently validated by Molecular Cartography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Interestingly, we did not find <italic>Vcam1</italic> to be significantly zonated in KCs in healthy livers suggesting its upregulation is a response to the metastatic process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Upregulation of VCAM-1 during metastatic disease has been previously reported for LECs and may contribute to immune cell recruitment by interactions with its binding partner integrin α4β1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To date, the function of VCAM-1 in KCs has not been well studied, but Okada et al. have described that VCAM-1 can mediate interactions of KCs and lymphocytes, which in turn promotes KC activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">This spurred us to perform L-R interaction analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> for KCs and lymphocytes (T and B cells) in periportal and pericentral zones. This analysis uncovered an enrichment of KC-expressed ligand <italic>Vcam1</italic> interacting with <italic>α9β1, α4β7</italic> and <italic>α4β1</italic> integrin complex receptors on T and B cells in periportal compared to pericentral zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Molecular Cartography could validate an enriched periportal gene expression of <italic>Vcam1</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic> (Integrin subunit β1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). A primary function of α4β7 and α4β1 integrins on T cells is mediating tissue homing and adhesion to the vessel wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, indicating that periportal KCs may have upregulated <italic>Vcam1</italic> expression to promote lymphocyte recruitment. This is in line with an increase in predicted <italic>Ccl3|Ccr5</italic> interactions between periportal KCs and T cells, as CCR5 was reported to mediate the recruitment of T cells to the liver during acute inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sphere-sequencing of metastases-bearing mouse liver reveals cell types and interactions specific to the metastatic-niche</title><p id="P8">Instead of grouping spheres according to liver zonation we next grouped them based on their distance to micro-metastatic sites. Spheres containing metastatic cells were defined as ‘proximal’ and spheres without metastatic cells as ‘distal’ to metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). First, we assessed cell-type proportions of key cell subsets and found that proximal areas had a significantly higher proportion of monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Segmentation and cell-type annotation of Molecular Cartography data validated those findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), highlighting that sphere-seq faithfully recapitulates <italic>in situ</italic> cell-type proportions. We decided to investigate the monocyte subset more closely and found that proximal areas showed a trend for enrichment of <italic>C1q+</italic> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We could validate the increased abundance of <italic>C1q+</italic> monocytes within proximal areas in Molecular Cartography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). <italic>C1q+</italic> macrophages are reportedly involved in T cell exhaustion and are an indicator of poor prognosis in many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore we wanted to investigate cellular crosstalk between monocytes and T cells further. We found significantly more colocalisations between monocytes and T cells within proximal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>) suggesting a potential role for monocyte T cell interactions in shaping the immune response in the metastatic microenvironment.</p><p id="P9">To identify potential drivers of these interactions we performed L-R interaction analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> which revealed a number of spatially restricted interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Notably, this included interactions of Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>Spp1</italic>), Fibronectin-1 (<italic>Fn1</italic>) and <italic>Vcam1</italic> with α4β1 integrin complexes on T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). While VCAM-1 α4β1 interactions are mostly noted as adhesive interactions, SPP1 and FN1 are associated with a poor prognosis in various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. SPP1 was previously found to suppress T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, while FN1 reportedly correlates with infiltration of anti-inflammatory macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Interactions of both of these monocyte-derived ligands with integrins on other immune cells were found to be enriched in colorectal cancer and might be involved in promoting tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, we found a proximal enrichment of <italic>Cxcl10|Cxcr3</italic>, an interaction which is well-known for mediating effector T cell recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and has been found to be enriched between <italic>C1q+</italic> macrophages and other immune cell subsets in colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Sphere-sequencing can be adapted to other tissue types and species</title><p id="P10">Sphere-seq can be easily adapted to other tissue types and species with minor adjustments to single cell dissociation. We have created proof-of-principle datasets from the mouse spleen and further showed that the method is compatible with clinical samples by applying it to Crohn’s disease biopsies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a-d</xref>,). For clinical samples, we introduced size-selection based on sequential filtering and manual picking of spheres to demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol in the absence of an expensive biosorter apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">Like any spatial transcriptomics methodology, sphere-seq has inherent strengths and limitations. Direct comparison to Visium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, one of the most widely used spatial transcriptomics methods, demonstrates the strength of sphere-seq. Visium’s <italic>in situ</italic> permeabilization protocols need to be optimized for different tissue compositions, resulting in compromise solutions and uneven data quality in heterogeneous tissues such as metastasis-bearing organs, while sphere-seq demonstrates far more consistent results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a-c</xref>). The greatest advantage of sphere-seq compared to slice-based spatial transcriptomics is single cell resolution. In contrast, Visium data requires deconvolution of spots into single cells, which revealed a clear bias towards hepatocytes in our datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>). This phenomenon has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and is attributed to the RNA content of hepatocytes superseding that of smaller cells like LECs.</p><p id="P12">In our dataset, Visium failed to reliably detect the LEC and KC zonated genes <italic>Plpp1, Galnt15</italic>, and <italic>Vcam1</italic>, therefore, we assessed their expression in publicly available Visium datasets from healthy wild type and NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This confirmed zonated gene expression, with <italic>Vcam1</italic> expression being more heavily expressed and zonated in NAFLD compared to healthy livers, in line with its involvement in inflammatory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8e,f</xref>). However, due to the lack of single cell resolution of Visium data, it cannot be directly determined whether zonated gene expression is caused by KCs or LECs. In fact, prior knowledge of the importance of <italic>Vcam1</italic> in LECs would likely lead to neglecting its zonation in KCs. In sum, comparison with Visium demonstrates sphere-seq’s superior performance in uncovering zonated gene-expression patterns in subdominant cell types. As demonstrated here, sphere-seq enables unsupervised spatial hypothesis generation for entire tissues. This makes sphere-seq an ideal method for exploratory research, which can then be validated by image-based spatial transcriptomics or proteomics methods that offer subcellular spatial resolution but require prior knowledge of gene expression for panel assembly.</p><p id="P13">Another advantage of sphere-seq is its compatibility with existing downstream protocols used for scRNA-seq, such as the vast existing catalog of computational methods. Furthermore, sphere-seq has the potential to profile other modalities, such as chromatin accessibility or proteins, solely by adapting the scRNA-seq protocol to ATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> or CITE-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> approaches, respectively. So far, sphere-seq has been exclusively applied to fresh tissues, however, the protocol could be modified for frozen tissues. Sphere-seq could theoretically be adapted to single nuclei RNA sequencing by modifying lysis protocols and exchanging lipid- with cholesterol-tagging barcodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Like any methodology that uses spatial reconstruction, sphere-seq is limited by prior knowledge of landmark gene expression patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to reconstruct the position of spheres within tissues. This could be resolved by combining sphere-seq with array-based spatial transcriptomics methods to identify spatial landmark genes and group spheres according to their spatial niches. Unlike sliced-based spatial transcriptomics methods, sphere-seq is not limited to individual two-dimensional regions of interest, and is therefore more representative of the sample tissue as a whole. However, spheres are generated in a random process and rare niches might not be reliably captured. This could be amended by introducing fluorescently-labeled antibodies or fluorescent reporter genes to indicate rare niches of interest and select for signal-positive spheres with the large sample sorter.</p><p id="P14">In sum, we have shown that sphere-seq is a powerful new tool to investigate differences in cellular composition and gene expression between distinct tissue niches. To the best of our knowledge, we here describe zonated gene expression in KCs for the first time. Our new method furthermore empowered us to identify L-R interactions which are not only significantly enriched in the dataset but are also demonstrated to co-occur spatially. Finally, we showed that sphere-seq can be applied to other tissues and species. Altogether, we show that sphere-seq is a valuable addition to currently available technologies in the field of spatial transcriptomics.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mouse model of liver metastasis</title><p id="P15">VilCreERT2;APCfl/fl;Tp53fl/fl;KrasG12D/wt (AKP) organoids, obtained from Owen Sansom from Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow, were modified with an additional knockout in Smad4, resulting in VilCreERT2;APCfl/fl;Tp53fl/fl;KrasG12D/wt;Smad4KO (AKPS).

In this graph, vertices represent the cells which are connected by an edge if the distance is smaller than 10 μm. To construct the graph, we utilized a kd-tree based nearest neighbor search in a pre-defined radius of 10 μm as implemented in the R function ‘nn2’ (RANN v.2.6.1,searchtype=’radius’) with a sufficiently large k (k=41). This approach runs in O(M logM) time and avoids computation of the distance matrix for thousands of objects. The resulting adjacency matrix was then used to construct a graph using the igraph<sup><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">52</xref></sup> package (v.1.3.4). From this graph the number of edges between cell types was computed in each region of interest (ROI) and divided by the sum of the number of cells for each cell type pair to normalize for total cell numbers in the annotated regions. For each slide the difference in the normalized number of edges between the two groups of ROIs, e.g. proximal versus distal, was subsequently computed. This value was compared to an empirical null distribution derived from randomly permuting the labels of the vertices (m=1000) per slide. This approach takes tissue composition and spatial structure into account and allows the computation of P values as P=(b+1)/(m+1) where b is the number of times the permutation produced a more extreme number of edges between two cell types than observed and m the total number of permutations<sup><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">53</xref></sup>. This was done for each slide and possible cell-cell interactions to derive a score that represents the fraction of images in which a specific interaction was significant, with the sign representing co-localisation or avoidance; visualization was adopted from<sup><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">54</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS156511-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S71"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P69">We thank Owen Sansom (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK) for the AKPS organoids and Salvatore Piscuoglio (Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerland) for the human colon cancer organoids.
