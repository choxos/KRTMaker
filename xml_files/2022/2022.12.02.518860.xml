especially in persons who have neither been vaccinated nor recovered from previous infection. We hypothesized that disease progression and inflammatory responses were associated with alterations in the microbiome and metabolome. To test this, we integrated metagenome, metabolome, cytokine, and transcriptome profiles of longitudinally collected samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the beginning of the pandemic (before vaccines or variants of concern) and non-infected controls, and leveraged detailed clinical information and post-hoc confounder analysis to identify robust within- and cross-omics associations. Severe COVID-19 was directly associated with a depletion of potentially beneficial intestinal microbes mainly belonging to Clostridiales, whereas oropharyngeal microbiota disturbance appeared to be mainly driven by antibiotic use. COVID-19 severity was also associated with enhanced plasma concentrations of kynurenine, and reduced levels of various other tryptophan metabolites, lysophosphatidylcholines, and secondary bile acids. Decreased abundance of Clostridiales potentially mediated the observed reduction in 5-hydroxytryptophan levels. Moreover, altered plasma levels of various tryptophan metabolites and lower abundances of Clostridiales explained significant increases in the production of IL-6, IFNγ and/or TNFα. Collectively, our study identifies correlated microbiome and metabolome alterations as a potential contributor to inflammatory dysregulation in severe COVID-19.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="P5">

The infection typically starts with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms. After approximately one week, a minority of infected individuals develop pneumonia which may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The common kinetics of disease progression together with recent observational studies suggest that disease severity is primarily driven by a dysregulated immune response. Several studies found high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ, as well as T cell lymphopenia, decrease of non-classical (CD14<sup>lo</sup>CD16<sup>hi</sup>) monocytes, and occurrence of neutrophil precursors in the peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Older age, male sex, chronic lung and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, host genetics, and IFN autoantibodies have also been associated with severe disease and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, but these factors alone do not appear to explain the wide variability in the clinical course of COVID-19.</p><p id="P7">Mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and gut are physiologically colonized with a microbiota that consists of trillions of microbial cells and whose diversity and composition vary widely among individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The microbiota constantly generates thousands of unique metabolites that can influence many aspects of human biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Animal studies have revealed that the microbiota calibrates immune responses during pulmonary and systemic infections, e.g. through production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan catabolites, and secondary bile acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Interindividual gut microbiota differences in humans have been associated with variation in cytokine production capacities of peripheral blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and lung microbiota composition has been linked to e.g. baseline levels of proinflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Previous studies have also indicated an association between COVID-19 status and/or severity, gut microbiota composition, and production of some inflammatory mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, a reduced abundance of upper respiratory tract commensals in severe COVID-19 patients has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we longitudinally collected samples from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity as well as from uninfected controls, and applied an integrated systems approach to characterize the interplay between the microbiome, metabolome and immune system.

We longitudinally collected plasma, stool, urine, and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from a total of 30 laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity, as well as 15 uninfected, age- and sex-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In parallel, we obtained comprehensive clinical information including underlying diseases, medication before and during hospitalization, and the development of secondary infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We classified patient samples into early or late observation groups based on the number of days since symptom onset (≤10 days or &gt;10 days, respectively). According to the WHO ordinal scale of clinical improvement (OSCI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-therapeutic-trial-synopsis">www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-therapeutic-trial-synopsis</ext-link>), 22 patients (73.3%) had mild disease (maximum OSCI score 1-4), and 8 (26.7%) had a more severe disease course (maximum OSCI score 5-8), 3 of whom died in the hospital. The median duration of hospitalization was 8.5 days (range 3-132 days) excluding patients who died (3). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 14 patients at an early phase of infection as well as 11 controls, and tracheobronchial secretions (TBS) were collected from 4 ventilated COVID-19 patients. We performed whole metagenome sequencing of stool, OP and TBS samples, metabolomics of plasma and urine, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of PBMCs, multiplex cytokine ELISA of plasma, and <italic>IFN</italic> qRT-PCRs of OP samples. Our integrated statistical approach enabled us to analyze -omics and clinical data individually and in conjunction with one another while accounting for a range of potential confounders.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Airway and intestinal microbiota disturbance in severe COVID-19</title><p id="P10">To characterize the microbiota of our cohorts, shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted on a total of 94 OP swabs, 18 TBS, and 81 stool samples. The gut microbiota of COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly decreased taxonomic diversity and richness when compared to uninfected controls (FDR-adjusted P&lt;0.001) regardless of infection timepoint, which is in line with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. These depletions were most strongly associated with disease severity as measured by OSCI score, and negatively correlated with the number of days patients were hospitalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Taxonomic profiling further revealed that severe courses of COVID-19 robustly associated with lower abundances of several commensals including Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, <italic>Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia</italic>, and <italic>Intestinibacter</italic> in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Importantly, disease severity explained more significant variation in the intestinal abundances of these taxa than antibiotic intake during the sampling period. The depletion of commensals was exacerbated and in some cases potentially mediated by longer hospitalization times. Patients with longer hospitalization times additionally displayed depletions of e.g. <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> along with increased colonization by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>.</p><p id="P11">In the oropharynx, severe disease courses were associated with depletion of e.g. <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> and <italic>Kingella</italic>, while current antibiotic use was associated with decreased abundance of e.g. <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and enrichment of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Similar to previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, diversity and richness of the oropharyngeal microbiota as well as abundance of various members commonly found in healthy individuals are lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to uninfected controls, but these perturbations also appeared to be mainly driven by antibiotic administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, D, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, we observed a negative correlation between the abundances of several commensals of the human oropharynx like <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic>, and the development of a secondary hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The depletion of <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> was at the same time partially explained by the use of antibiotics. Moreover, we found enrichment with Gram-negative bacilli like <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Achromobacter</italic> in some of the TBS samples obtained from ventilated patients who developed HAP (for simplicity, we use the term HAP throughout to refer to all types of nosocomial pneumonia in both ventilated and non-ventilated patients) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Collectively, our results indicate a direct association between intestinal microbiota abnormalities and severe COVID-19, whereas oropharyngeal microbiota disturbance appeared to be mainly driven by antibiotic use in our patients.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19</title><p id="P12">To characterize the systemic immune response in our cohort, we measured cytokines in plasma samples from all patients and healthy controls. In line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, type I, II and III IFNs as well as several inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IP-10/CXCL10, CCL2, and IL-10 were increased in early plasma samples of COVID-19 patients when compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-H</xref>). While IFN levels mostly decreased in the later phase of the infection, production of the inflammatory cytokines remained high in severe COVID-19 patients. Next, we characterized PBMCs from a subset of patients at an early infection time point and uninfected controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) by droplet-based scRNAseq. Since we aimed to focus primarily on the innate immune cells, PBMCs were depleted of T and B lymphocytes before measurements. UMAP and cell type classification identified various cell types and subtypes expected in the mononuclear compartment of blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I, J</xref>). Further analyses revealed an increase of classical monocytes in severe COVID-19 patients as compared to uninfected individuals and patients with mild infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>), and a depletion of non-classical monocytes and cDCs in early COVID-19. NK cells were only depleted in patients with severe COVID-19. IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) were highly expressed in PBMCs of mild and severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A,B,D</xref>), and ISG expression correlated with systemic levels of both type I and II IFNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3C</xref>). Moreover, we measured expression of type I and III IFN genes in our oropharyngeal samples, and found increased <italic>IFNL2</italic> mRNA levels in mild COVID-19 patients as compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). Overall, our results indicate that the systemic inflammatory response is disturbed in patients with severe COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Alterations in tryptophan, bile acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in severe COVID-19</title><p id="P13">To identify potential microbiota- and/or host-derived factors underlying COVID-19 phenotypes, we performed metabolomic analyses on a total of 96 plasma and 77 urine samples from COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 patients when compared to uninfected controls, as well as direct associations between various metabolites and disease severity. In COVID-19 patients, we observed lower plasma levels of several tryptophan metabolites including the primarily dietary-derived tryptophan itself (<italic>ρ</italic>=-0.68, FDR-adjusted P&lt;0.0001), the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (<italic>ρ</italic>=-0.38, FDR-adjusted P=0.0003), and the microbial metabolites tryptamine, indole-3-propionic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>), indicating severe disturbance of host-dependent kynurenine and serotonin pathways and the microbiota-dependent indole metabolic pathway. Many of the altered tryptophan metabolites are ligands for the immunoregulatory aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the host-derived tryptophan catabolites kynurenine, which is also an AhR ligand, and the potentially neurotoxic 3-hydroxykynurenine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> were strongly enriched in COVID-19 patients, with kynurenine showing a robust association with severity (<italic>ρ</italic>=0.7, FDR-adjusted P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), in both early and late samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Moreover, severe COVID-19 was robustly associated with lower plasma concentrations of the microbiota-produced secondary bile acid glycodeoxycholic acid (<italic>ρ</italic>=-0.42, FDR-adjusted P=0.0006), and with higher levels of the primary bile acid taurocholic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Secondary bile acids have recently been shown to calibrate various immune cells and pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, COVID-19 infection and disease severity were also associated with depletion of various lysophosphatidylcholines at all sampling timepoints and phosphatidylcholines in the early samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-B</xref>). Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of proinflammatory lipids that are produced from phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, and shown to have effects on e.g. endothelial cells and immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tryptophan, bile acid, lipid, and other amino acid metabolism is dysregulated in severe COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Integrated analyses reveal associations between altered levels of tryptophan metabolites and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines</title><p id="P14">Finally, we integrated our various -omics data into our mixed-models analysis framework in order to establish potential associations between the microbiome, metabolome, and immune response parameters. First, we summarized the extent to which features from the different -omics spaces were associated with disease severity and/or confounded by different clinical factors such as previous or current antibiotic use, other medications, comorbidity, days of hospitalization, or age. This analysis revealed that many features of the gut microbiome, immune response, and plasma metabolome were robustly associated with COVID-19 severity, whereas most features of the oropharyngeal microbiome and urinary metabolome were only indirectly (i.e. confounded) or not significantly associated with COVID-19 severity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). In particular, a large part of the alterations of the oropharyngeal microbiome appeared to be driven by previous and current antibiotic therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Next, we focused on the three most strongly COVID-19-linked -omics feature spaces, and used the robust severity-associated subset from each in further modeling steps to identify all unconfounded individual associations between features from different spaces (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). This analysis uncovered 115 robust associations between the gut microbiome and the plasma metabolome, 3 between the gut microbiome and the immune response, and 29 between the plasma metabolome and the immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Lastly, we generated a model based on the most robust and interconnected associations between the three -omics data sets. Our model suggests that tryptophan metabolism is tightly linked to the dysregulated immune response in severe COVID-19, since a depletion of tryptophan and its metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophan, as well as enhanced levels of kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, explained significant increases in the production of IL-6, IFNγ and/or TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Decreased 5-hydroxytryptophan in severe COVID-19 might be mediated by a depletion of Clostridiales and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> spp. from the gut, as both taxa robustly correlated with the metabolite levels, and in both cases the microbe-severity association was reducible to the microbe-metabolite association. Likewise, the association between IFNγ and disease severity was reducible to the association between IFNγ and kynurenine when modeled and tested jointly, indicating potential mediation. Depletion of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> was also associated with reduced production of the immunomodulatory metabolite tryptamine, which is similar to several of the above-mentioned tryptophan metabolites a ligand of AhR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, reduced intestinal abundance of Clostridiales explained significant variation in kynurenine, and in TNFα levels independent of 5-hydroxytryptophan. <italic>Roseburia</italic> might directly or indirectly be involved in the production of formylkynurenine, an intermediate of the kynurenine reaction and precursor for kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, since reduced abundances of this genus robustly associated with the decrease of the metabolite. Moreover, IFNγ production correlated with phenylalanine, and reduced concentrations of several lysophosphatidylcholines explained significant variation in IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ levels. Taken together, our analysis indicates that alterations in both the microbiota- and host-dependent tryptophan metabolism, as well as potentially other metabolic pathways, may contribute to the dysregulated inflammatory immune reaction in severe COVID-19.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">While several excellent microbiomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, metabolomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and multi-omics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> of COVID-19 have been published, our work is unique in simultaneously measuring and analyzing a particularly large number of different -omics types, and, in this, the first to integrate gut and oropharyngeal metagenome sequencing, metabolomics, host transcriptomics, and cytokine profiling. Our analyses using linear mixed-effect models and exhaustive confounder testing revealed the plasma metabolome to be the -omics domain most affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, plasma levels of various host- and microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites and lysophosphatidylcholines robustly correlated with COVID-19 severity, as did secondary bile acids in our study. In addition, enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and gut microbiota perturbations were strongly associated with the infection. For example, taxonomic diversity and richness were reduced in severe COVID-19 patients, and several potentially beneficial commensals (mainly belonging to the Clostridiales order as well as <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>) were depleted, which is consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast, the oropharyngeal microbiome alterations observed in our COVID-19 patients were largely explained by antibiotic use. Some of the changes (e.g. depletion of <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>) were at the same time associated with the development of HAP.</p><p id="P16">We related the depletion of intestinal Clostridiales and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> to the perturbed production of various tryptophan metabolites, and found that the increased production of key inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ was statistically reducible to microbiota and metabolome features in some cases. The constellation of robust, cross-omics associations we uncovered thus contributes potential biomarkers as well as novel mechanistic hypotheses regarding the dysregulated immune response considered causative of severe COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, we estimated these mechanisms to further involve a vicious cycle, as critical illness, prolonged hospitalization, and high concentrations of inflammatory mediators further exacerbate the disruption of the microbiome and metabolome. Still, we speculate that several of our findings, e.g. hypotheses describing how certain intestinal commensals are associated with specific metabolites, or how tryptophan catabolites and lysophosphatidylcholines may regulate systemic cytokine production, are also relevant for other types of severe infections and perhaps non-infectious inflammatory diseases.</p><p id="P17">While levels of the host-derived tryptophan catabolite kynurenine were strongly elevated, tryptamine, indole-3-acetic and other microbiota-derived tryptophan catabolites were depleted in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients. All of these metabolites are known to activate the AhR, which controls the differentiation and inflammatory potential of various innate and adaptive immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. It is likely that, in aggregate, the markedly altered levels of these AhR ligands observed in our cohort contributed to the dysregulation of the immune response in severe COVID-19; however, further studies are needed to understand the cumulative impact of oppositely altered tryptophan catabolites (which presumably also differ with respect to their AhR binding affinities) on individual immune cells. Moreover, more research is also required to characterize the impact of these metabolites in different phases of COVID-19, such as the acute inflammatory phase, resolution, or the subsequent period of tissue repair.</p><p id="P18">We also observed that metabolites of the serotonin pathway were altered in plasma and/or urine of patients suffering from severe COVID-19, and that changes in 5-hydroxytryptophan levels explained significant variation in the production of IL-6 and IFNγ. From our integrated statistical modeling, we concluded that the depletion of 5-hydroxytryptophan was potentially mediated by low intestinal abundances of Clostridiales and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, which is consistent with previous findings about the role of the microbiota in controlling the production of 5-hydroxytryptophan by colonic enterochromaffin cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Interestingly, 5-hydroxytryptophan has also recently been described to activate the AhR and to mediate CD8+ T cell exhaustion in antitumor immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, it appears reasonable to speculate that 5-hydroxytryptophan contributes to AhR-mediated calibration of inflammatory cytokine production during COVID-19, as well as to T cell exhaustion characteristic of severe SARS-CoV2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids that have been found to influence e.g. immune and endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

Moreover, lysophosphatidylcholine treatment was protective in mouse models of sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. We observed reduced levels of lysophosphatidylcholines in severe COVID-19 patients, and strong associations with enhanced production of IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ; this is potentially in line with a previous study showing that lysophosphatidylcholines inhibit the release of IL-6 by human monocytes in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Another interesting group of metabolites whose production we found to vary with severe COVID-19 was the secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids, which are converted from liver-derived primary bile acids by the microbiota, are known for their ability to influence various immune cells, e.g., via the receptors TGR5 and FXR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Though we were not able to identify associations between secondary bile acids and specific immune features, this does not exclude the possibility that other immune mediators or cells in different compartments (such as the lung) are influenced by these metabolites. Indeed, a recent study uncovers how secondary acids control immunity against Chikungunya virus by enhancing type I IFN production by pDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of secondary bile acids and other microbiota-derived metabolites on the immune response during COVID-19.</p><p id="P21">Our multi-omics study explores alterations in the microbiome, metabolome and immune response observed in severe COVID-19, and generates several novel testable hypotheses, but is not without limitations. First, we included only a relatively small number of patients from a single center, which mandates future validation in larger cohorts of patients; however, we performed deep phenotyping using various state-of-the-art omics techniques and integrative bioinformatics approaches, including extensive testing for confounding factors such as use of antibiotics and other medications, which are known to drive contradictory findings in the COVID-19 literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Second, for practical reasons and similar to probably all previously published work, we were unable to collect samples during the first days of infection, making it impossible to draw conclusions about mechanisms in the early phase of COVID-19. Third, we did not perform analyses of the immune response in the lung as the epicenter of the infectious event in COVID-19, which would be important for future studies. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the interaction between the microbiome, metabolome, and immune system in general, and into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in particular. Future work should include animal experiments to mechanistically explore and resolve causality among the microbiome-metabolite-immune networks in COVID-19, and perhaps other infectious and inflammatory diseases. The disrupted microbiome-tryptophan metabolism-immune network described here might represent a potential target for novel intervention strategies to protect patients from severe COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Study design and patient inclusion criteria</title><p id="P22">In the framework of the Pa-COVID-19, a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, we longitudinally collected stool, urine, TBS and blood samples as well as oropharyngeal swabs from hospitalized patients with COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

The molecular ion and at least two transitions were monitored for the 15 metabolites that are part of the tryptophan pathway.</p><p id="P36">Data was exported into Skyline (v.19.1, 64-bit) to identify and quantify peak intensity and area. Transition settings in the Skyline search were: isotopic peaks included: count; precursor mass analyzer: QIT; acquisition method: targeted; product mass analyzer: QIT. Method match searching tolerance was 0.6 m/z, and data was manually checked to ensure the correct peaks were selected. Cubic spline drift correction was applied per metabolite and to all sample types using the pooled quality control (QC) samples as references to fit the splines. The first and the last QC samples used to fit the cubic splines are the most critical to the resulting fit. In this case, the last conditioning pooled QC sample and the first of two pooled QC replicates at the end of the analytical run were used as the first and last QC respectively in the batch correction. Standard samples of increasing concentration were used to construct calibration curves using linear fits per metabolite in ng/ml. Concentration values less or equal to zero were declared as missing. In this study, several study groups featured measurements systematically outside of the calibration range for some metabolites (i.e. below or above the smallest or largest standard sample applied for a metabolites calibration curve, respectively). Further, calibration of QC standard samples resulted in insufficient accuracy. However, precision (%RSD in either standard or pooled QC samples) was adequate for most compounds. Hence, metabolites cannot be considered as absolutely but as relatively quantified in this study. In-house R scripts were used for internal standard normalization, calibration, statistics and plotting. Quality assurance and control were reported using the recommended standards be mQACC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>):</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Taxonomic and functional microbiome profiling</title><p id="P37">Whole genome shotgun sequencing reads were analyzed using the NGLess pipeline (v1.3.0). Sequences were quality controlled, trimmed and merged using NGLess defaults and subsequently filtered for human reads. One stool sample and two TBS samples were of insufficient quality and removed from further analysis. Taxonomic assignment was performed using the mOTUs profiler (v2.6). Functional annotation was performed by mapping rarefied reads to the Global Microbial Gene Catalog (GMGC, v1.0), then binning into either KEGG Modules through custom scripts or gut metabolic modules (GMMs) using the Java implementation of the Omixer-RPM reference mapper software.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Taxonomic profile post-processing, normalization, and diversity analyses</title><p id="P38">Both mOTUs and functionally-profiled metagenomic counts were transformed to relative abundances, then filtered to exclude features which were a) nonzero in less than 10% of samples, b) with a mean relative abundance less than 10e-4, or c) with zero variance.

The full set of clinical variables and per-individual values are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>; variables which had less than three nonzero observations in both the patient and control groups (6 total) were not tested.</p><p id="P41">In a second step, significant clinical variables from the first step were used in an iterative, nested regression procedure to assess post-hoc confounding potential. Single -omics feature abundances were rank-transformed and regressed onto a disease status label, both 1) with and 2) without a potentially confounding variable from the first step, followed by a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between nested models 1 and 2. Linear mixed-effect models were used to account for longitudinal sampling. This was repeated combinatorially across all post-processed -omics feature abundances and clinical variables, and integrated to yield a single status for each feature-clinical variable association (including disease status and severity): robust (not confounded by any naively significant covariates), confounded (and if so by what/which), or not significant (summary of results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple testing in both the naive statistical tests and likelihood ratio tests.</p><p id="P42">Concretely, our software produces a table of results in which each row contains the statistical summary for a single -omics feature and clinical variable pair (e.g. alpha diversity and OSCI score, respectively). There are identifier columns for each of these (“Y_dep.var” and “X_ind.var” for dependent Y and independent X variables in the models, respectively), and columns for naive effect size and adjusted p-values (XY_eff.size and XY_p.adj, respectively). The final column (“AssocStatus”) is either a status (D for “deconfounded” or NS for “not significant”), or, if “confounded”, a list of other clinical variables which resulted in a no-longer-significant association between X and Y in the given row when modeled as second independent variable. In our example, the gut alpha diversity was “deconfounded” (i.e. robustly associated with the OSCI score), while the oropharyngeal alpha diversity was confounded by antibiotic use, which was listed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Our combined results from analysis with each of the post-processed -omics data tables and clinical metadata are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Cross-omics associations and integrated statistical analysis</title><p id="P43">As described above, all individual -omics features were tested for associations with the same set of clinical factors including disease status and severity, revealing a subset of features from each space which was robustly correlated with the OSCI score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). To examine associations and generate hypotheses between different -omics spaces, we reconfigured our statistical framework to include robust subsets of severity-associated “cross-omics” features as additional independent variables. This produced naive correlations between e.g. severity-associated microbial taxa and metabolites or immune parameters, and further expanded our ability to classify their robustness via iterative nested model testing.</p><p id="P44">As a concrete example of a single step in this extended framework: plasma kynurenine (KYN) and IFNγ were both robustly associated with severity, so kynurenine was included as an additional independent variable when re-testing IFNγ against disease severity (OSCI). Three models were built:</p><p id="P45">osci_model: rank(IFNγ) ∼ OSCI</p><p id="P46">kyn_model: rank(IFNγ) ∼ KYN</p><p id="P47">full_model: rank(IFNγ) ∼ OSCI + KYN</p><p id="P48">Then two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were performed with different nested model comparisons, and their results were used to classify the association between IFNγ and the OSCI score:</p><p id="P49">Test 1: likelihood ratio test between full_model and osci_model</p><p id="P50">Test 2: likelihood ratio test between full_model and kyn_model</p><p id="P51">Test 1 checks whether kynurenine explains significant variation in IFNγ measurements beyond that which is already explained by the OSCI score, while test 2 checks the converse. If only test 1 is significant, then, it can be concluded that the OSCI-IFNγ association is statistically reducible to the KYN-IFNγ association, and therefore the OSCI-IFNγ association may be considered “confounded” by kynurenine. If only test 2 or both tests are significant, the OSCI-IFNγ association is at least partially statistically independent of kynurenine, and may be considered robust (so long as it remains statistically independent from the other clinical and cross-omics variables tested).</p><p id="P52">This logic is identical to that used in the framework to test each set of -omics features against clinical variables; however, the aim there was to reduce dimensionality in each -omics space to a robust severity-associated subset. Here, we broadened the interpretation of post-hoc LRT-identified “confounders” in this cross-omics context to consider them as potential mediators.

Some co-associated clinical variables were rationally grouped and relabeled here for annotation purposes, i.e. a metabolite confounded by hospitalization and infection reflects confounding by one or more of the following: HAP, number of days hospitalized, or other hospitalization-associated infections such as bacteremia and sepsis. The kynurenine and serotonin pathways are host-associated, while indole and part of the bile acid metabolism are carried out by gut microbes.

While low abundances of tryptophan and tryptophan-associated microbes negatively correlated with disease severity, downstream kynurenine metabolites were positively correlated with disease severity, and could explain significant variation in pro-inflammatory host cytokines (TNFα, IL-6) and type II interferon (IFNγ).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158079-f005"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="rows"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center">Characteristics</th><th valign="middle" align="center">Patients</th><th valign="middle" align="center">Controls</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">N</td><td valign="middle" align="center">30</td><td valign="middle" align="center">15</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Average age, y (SD)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">58.17 (18.15)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">52.80 (19.37)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Female, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">43.3 (13)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">40.0 (6)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Average BMI, (SD)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">26.85 (4.91)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">23.94 (3.52)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Active smokers, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">10.0 (3)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">6.7 (1)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left" colspan="3">Comorbidities</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Diabetes mellitus, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">16.7 (5)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">6.7 (1)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Cardiovascular disease, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">53.3 (16)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">26.7 (4)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Chronic lung disease, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">30.0 (9)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Chronic kidney disease, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">33.3 (10)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Chronic liver disease, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">16.7 (5)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">6.7 (1)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     IBD, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">3.3 (1)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Dyslipidemia, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">16.7 (5)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">13.3 (2)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: hidden"><td valign="middle" align="left">     Active neoplasia, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">3.3 (1)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr><td valign="middle" align="left">     Altered thyroid hormones, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">23.3 (7)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">6.7 (1)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Charlson Comorbidity Index, median (IQR)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">2.5 (4.0)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">1.0 (3.25)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">OSCI, median (IQR)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">4.0 (2.0)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Gastrointestinal symptoms at admission, % (n)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">23.3 (7)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (0)</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom:solid thin;"><td valign="middle" align="left">Medication, median (IQR)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">2 (3.0)</td><td valign="middle" align="center">0 (2.0)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
