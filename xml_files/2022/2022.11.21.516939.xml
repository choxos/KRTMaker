MRTs are genetically defined by bi-allelic inactivating mutations in <italic>SMARCB1</italic>, a member of the BRG1/BRM-associated factors (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations in BAF complex members are common in human cancer, yet their contribution to tumorigenesis remains in many cases poorly understood.

Depending on their protein composition, three main BAF complexes have been identified. The canonical BAF (cBAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (pBAF) complexes are defined by, amongst others, the SMARCB1 subunit, which is lacking in the non-canonical (nc)BAF complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Instead, the ncBAF complex contains the BRD9 and GLTSCR1/L subunits. Genes encoding members of the BAF complex are among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer, occurring in approximately 20-25% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Adult malignancies typically harbor hundreds to thousands of mutations, which complicates studying the contribution of mutations in BAF members to tumorigenesis. However, several pediatric malignancies are uniquely defined by mutations in BAF complex members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Amongst those are malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), aggressive childhood malignancies that predominantly affect infants. They can occur throughout the body, but most commonly arise in the brain (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT)) and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Despite their aggressiveness, MRTs are genetically stable tumors with a low mutational burden. In fact, in the vast majority of MRT cases (95%), bi-allelic inactivation of the BAF complex member <italic>SMARCB1</italic> is the only recurrent protein coding gene alteration, showing that loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> is a crucial driver event in MRT development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We recently found that bi-allelic <italic>SMARCB1</italic> inactivating mutations in MRT can be shared with adjacent morphologically normal Schwann cells, suggesting that loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> is required but not sufficient for MRT development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic reprogramming, which can be caused by mutations in chromatin regulators such as BAF complex members, underpins tumor initiation and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To identify and functionally study patient-specific epigenomic changes underlying malignant growth, personalized pre-clinical cell models are indispensable. Such models should reflect the epigenetic heterogeneity found between patient tumors. We and others have previously demonstrated that organoids maintain many features of the tissues they were derived from, including their epigenetic profiles, over extended serial passaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here, we apply a multi-omics approach to patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to define how loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reorganizes chromatin and underpins MRT growth. We find patient-specific enhancer landscapes that are a consequence of a disruption in the balance of BAF complexes. Specifically, we identified patient-specific putative enhancers in different PDOs that likely regulate the expression of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene driving MRT growth. One of these putative enhancers has not been previously described within the context of tumorigenesis. The patient-specific derailed activity of these putative enhancers was also observed in patient tumors. Our study provides the first evidence that intertumoral heterogeneity in enhancer utilization drives oncogene expression and tumorigenesis in MRT.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Analysis of chromatin dynamics in MRT PDOs reveals SMARCB1-dependent enhancer regulation</title><p id="P7">We previously showed that <italic>SMARCB1</italic> loss is required but not sufficient for malignant transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that additional epigenetic drivers are required for tumor formation. Reconstitution of the principal genetic driver event of MRT, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> loss, reverts MRT cells to a normalized state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting that epigenetic changes that have contributed to malignancy can be overcome. To find these tumor-driving regulatory changes, we lentivirally transduced a MRT PDO model (named P103)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> with either a control or a <italic>SMARCB1</italic> expression (<italic>SMARCB1</italic>+) plasmid and measured chromatin accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, we find 7,941 newly formed open chromatin regions (OCRs) that are enriched for transcription factor motifs from different families such as SMARCC1/2 and AP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1A,B</xref>). When we perform functional annotation of these OCRs using GREAT, we find that several categories are enriched, mostly related to differentiation and developmental processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1C</xref>). For the 1,211 OCRs that were lost, the only motif that we found to be enriched was for the insulator protein CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with previous reports in human embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMID: 31033435; PMID: 28262751).</p><p id="P8">ChIP-seq of CTCF showed that <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution results in a decrease in CTCF binding at OCRs that are lost in <italic>SMARCB1</italic>+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In the genome, CTCF binding frequently overlaps with binding of the ring-shaped cohesin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. ChIP-seq of the cohesin complex subunit RAD21 confirmed that, in addition to decreased CTCF binding, OCRs lost in <italic>SMARCB1</italic>+ cells show a reduction in binding of the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). On the other hand, OCRs gained in the <italic>SMARCB1</italic>+ PDOs showed occupancy of RAD21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), but not CTCF. To determine how the enhancer landscape changes upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, we performed ChIP-seq of the active enhancer mark H3K27ac. As expected, the lost OCRs show a decrease in H3K27ac levels, while a marked increase in H3K27ac levels was detected at sites that gained accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Increases in enhancer marks coincides with increased binding of the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), which is consistent with a subset of cohesin molecules binding to (super) enhancer regions, besides CTCF binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the canonical BAF complexes play an important role in suppressing CTCF binding to chromatin and that loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> leads to increased accessibility at CTCF-bound chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SMARCB1 reorganizes the chromatin landscape surrounding the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene</title><p id="P9">Observing a change in the CTCF and RAD21 binding landscape following <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution led us to hypothesize that long-distance gene regulation may be affected in these cells. To determine whether any SMARCB1-dependent changes occur in the organization of the genome (3D genome), we performed high-resolution <italic>in-situ</italic> Hi-C experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> in control and <italic>SMARCB1</italic>+ P103 MRT PDOs. Despite the differences in CTCF binding to chromatin, we find that, in general, chromatin architecture is largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2A,B</xref>). 3D genome features such as topologically associated domains (TADs) and A/B compartments showed limited changes upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2C-G</xref>). However, we identified 131 and 1,164 loops specific to control and <italic>SMARCB1</italic>+ PDOs, respectively, with a minimal 1.5-fold change of contact frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Ranking the most prominently lost loci upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, we found an interaction between the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene and an ~1.1 Mb distal region marked by high H3K27ac levels indicative of a super enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene is of particular interest in the context of MRT, as it was previously demonstrated by us and others that MRTs are defined by a SMARCB1-dependent <italic>MYC</italic> gene expression signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, we observed a strong loss of <italic>MYC</italic> expression as well as deregulation of cell cycle-related genes upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, indicative of a cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Moreover, shRNA-induced knockdown of <italic>MYC</italic> in MRT PDOs resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3E</xref>), indicating that MYC is required for MRT growth. In addition to a decrease in <italic>MYC</italic> expression, we observed that chromatin accessibility at the super enhancer as well as at the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter strongly diminished upon reconstitution of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). These results show that SMARCB1 is required to prevent the formation of a distal super enhancer that interacts with the promoter of <italic>MYC</italic> through chromatin looping.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Patient specific super enhancers interact with <italic>MYC</italic> in MRT</title><p id="P11">We hypothesized that <italic>MYC</italic> distal enhancer looping may be a general mechanism driving MRT oncogenesis. To this end, we performed <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution in two additional MRT PDOs (P78 and P60). RNA-seq analysis revealed a decrease in <italic>MYC</italic> expression in both these MRT models, as well as deregulation of cell cycle genes confirming the induction of a proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). Next, we performed 4C-seq, a chromosome conformation capture method targeted to a specific genomic site, using the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter as the viewpoint, on these two additional PDOs. Similar to P103, P78 showed a reduction in <italic>MYC</italic> promoter contact frequency with the same ~1.1 Mb distal genomic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution. Remarkably, 4C-seq analysis in the third PDO model (P60) showed no interaction of the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter with our previously identified genomic region. Instead, 4C-seq uncovered two other chromatin loops that were diminished upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To chart the regulatory landscape of the PDO models in the presence and absence of SMARCB1, we performed ATAC-seq. When we overlaid the ATAC-seq data with the 4C-seq data, we found that the regions that interact with the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter were highly accessible. The accessibility correlates with the patient-specific <italic>MYC</italic> promoter interaction landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Upon <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, the loss of interactions coincides with a loss of accessibility at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The stretches of accessible chromatin in P78 resemble the super enhancer we identified in P103. Collectively, we refer to these putative super enhancer regions as Rhabdoid Oncogenic <italic>MYC</italic> Enhancer (RhOME) and number them according to their position in the genome. Notably, in contrast to RhOME2, RhOME1 (<italic>PCAT1</italic>) and RhOME3 (<italic>CCDC26</italic>) were previously identified as <italic>MYC</italic> regulatory regions in other tumor entities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our Hi-C and 4C experiments thus revealed that in different MRT PDOs, distinct distal enhancers interacting with the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter are active (RhOME1-3). The intertumoral specificity of the RhOMEs was further highlighted by the expression of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), distinctive for active super enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, specifically in the MRT PDOs in which these enhancers are active and interacting with the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results indicate that loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> induces an epigenetic state that is characterized by the formation of long-range promoter-enhancer loops that are specific to a PDO model, but heterogeneous between MRT PDOs derived from different donors.</p><p id="P13">Because MRT PDOs, to a large extent, retain the (epi-)genetic characteristics of the tissues they were derived from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, we used these models to further explore patient-specific epigenetic programs using ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4A,B</xref>). In addition to 29 and 556 OCRs that are consistently lost (Control-specific) or gained (SMARCB1+-specific) after <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution, respectively, we find many OCRs that are either specific for a single MRT PDO model or shared between two out of the three models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4B</xref>). In fact, 81.6%, 72.1% and 78.7% of the OCRs lost in P103, P78 and P60, respectively, are lost specifically in that PDO. In contrast, transcriptomic changes show less heterogeneity between the three MRT PDOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4C</xref>). To stratify the OCRs that are lost in P103, we performed <italic>k</italic>-means clustering including the ATAC-seq data from the three PDOs and the ChIP-seq data from P103. Consequently, we could classify the lost OCRs into (K1) non-enhancer CTCF binding sites, (K2) weak enhancers, and (K3) CTCF-independent super enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Consistent with the function of super enhancers in control of cell identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we identified the SOX protein motifs, including SOX2, SOX9 and SOX17, and functional annotations of many developmental processes that are associated with the K3 cluster-specific open chromatin sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5C,D</xref>). Whereas the K1 and K2 clusters show a similar accessibility pattern in all three PDO models, the accessilibity loss of the K3 cluster is specific to the P103 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig 5A</xref>). Our Hi-C analysis in P103 shows that these K3 cluster-specific super enhancers form insulation boundaries, which were essentially abolished upon reconstitution of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). Thus, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution in MRT organoids PDOs coincides with dramatic but local, patient-specific changes in genome topology and enhancer activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>MYC</italic> enhancer plasticity is reflected in patient MRT</title><p id="P14">Our data so far raise the intriguing possibility that there is intertumoral heterogeneity on the level of enhancer utilization driving expression of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene. To extrapolate our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to patient tissues, we first examined publicly available H3K27ac ChIP-seq profiles from patient MRT tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. As expected, the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter is marked by high levels of H3K27ac in the majority of patient samples, indicative of active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, broad enrichment for H3K27ac could be detected at RhOME1-3, showing that tumor super enhancer landscapes identified in MRT PDOs are preserved in MRT tissues. No peaks at RhOME1-3 could be detected in STJ0090 and STJ0537, which also show weak H3K27ac signals at the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter. Remarkably, and in line with our PDO data, the presence of H3K27ac peaks at the different RhOME loci was heterogeneously distributed across the other patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To assess whether differential enhancer utilization occurs within a tumor, i.e. intratumoral heterogeneity, we performed combined single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on seven MRT patient tissue samples using single-cell multiomics (Chromium 10X Genomics platform) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). After filtering, 14,799 cells were left for further analyses, with a median of 2,040 cells per tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Normal and tumor cells were assigned by cell type marker gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and <italic>SMARCB1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6A-D</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) space revealed that tumor cells clustered by patient, while non-malignant cells clustered by cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). <italic>MYC</italic> expression as well as OCRs at the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter were found across all MRTs and some normal cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6E</xref>). However, despite detectable <italic>MYC</italic> expression, almost no accessible chromatin could be detected at RhOME1-3 in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), suggesting that these super enhancers are tumor specific in these samples. Crucially, we found different combinations of OCRs at RhOME1-3 in the different patient MRTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). More specifically, while P156 and P168 are exclusively defined by OCRs at RhOME2, P052 and P041 primarily show open chromatin regions at RhOME1 and RhOME3 and in P166 OCRs were only found at RhOME3. OCRs were not found at any of the RhOMEs in P116 and P138 suggesting supraphysiological activation of <italic>MYC</italic> occurs through regulatory elements other than RhOME1-3 in these tumors.

As such, inhibition of the ncBAF subunit BRD9 was demonstrated to be a putative therapeutic vulnerability in MRT. We therefore set out to investigate the effect of ncBAF inhibition on MRT PDOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To do so, we treated MRT PDOs with a pharmacological inhibitor of BRD9 (iBRD9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

To statistically confirm the overlap between the differential gene sets, we performed a Fisher’s exact test on the two sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), which showed a strong similarity. Consistent with a decrease in proliferation, we observe a downregulation of cell cycle related gene sets as well as MYC target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).

Pediatric tumors on the other hand have a low mutational burden and are characterized by a small number or even a single driver event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Additional epigenetic changes may contribute to pediatric tumor formation. Identifying recurrent patient-specific epigenetic driver landscapes has remained challenging. Because PDOs maintain many molecular characteristics of their parental tumors they can be used to study patient-specific changes on the epigenetic level as well. Our BAF complex reconstitution experiments enabled us to zoom into putative oncogenic enhancers. Upon analyzing the (single-cell) regulatory landscapes of primary MRT tissue we were able to identify potential super enhancers that were recurrently activated in a patient-specific manner.</p><p id="P19">A common denominator of MRT is the high expression of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The regulatory mechanisms causing aberrant <italic>MYC</italic> activation in MRT has so far remained unknown. Here, we identify three putative super enhancers looping to the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter in MRT, as a consequence of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> loss. One of these super enhancers, RhOME2, has not been described before in the context of tumorigenesis. While different RhOMEs loop to the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter in different tumors (intertumoral heterogeneity), we find preferential use of one or a combination of RhOMEs within the same tumor. The patient-specific enhancer landscapes found in MRT could reflect the developmental origin of MRT, which lies in the neural crest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Neural crest development is characterized by rapid switching of cell states caused by, amongst others, chromatin reorganization to assure quick and simultaneous development of several different cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> in a specific cellular context during neural crest development prevents the inactivation of certain <italic>MYC</italic> enhancers, which is essential for proper lineage specification. Ultimately, these <italic>MYC</italic> enhancers may transform to an oncogenic <italic>MYC</italic> super enhancer and drive rhabdoid tumorigenesis. Depending on the cellular identity of the tumor initiating cell, different enhancer landscapes may be active, possibly explaining why we find patient-specific enhancers. During development, cellular identity is in part determined by growth factors and morphogens that signal to transcription factors to establish a cell-type specific regulatory landscape. How this regulatory landscape is maintained in the absence of these signaling molecules is an interesting question for the future.</p><p id="P20">Our work reveals a role for SMARCB1 in 3D genome organization regulating long-range promoter-enhancer loops. Furthermore, SMARCB1 is required to prevent the formation of super enhancer-driven TAD boundaries, which are observed in MRT cells. In a previous study, restoration of SMARCB1 in an epithelioid sarcoma cell line showed hardly any effects on 3D genome organization. Although in these cells <italic>MYC</italic> interacts with the genomic region of RhOME3, no difference was observed upon SMARCB1 reconstitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that SMARCB1 executes its role in 3D genome organization by preventing the formation of ectopic super-enhancers which may be cell-type specific. Super enhancers are bound by cohesin and we also observed this in the MRT cells explaining how the very distal RhOMEs can interact with the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter. We and others have previously shown that accessible chromatin regions, which are directly regulated by the BAF complex, are important for cohesin positioning at active enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>SMARCB1</italic> inactivation may alter long-range chromatin interactions via reshaping cohesin occupancy in the mutant cells. <italic>SMARCB1</italic> reconstitution drastically weakened CTCF binding, but the CTCF-anchored chromatin loops and the majority of TAD boundaries remained mostly unaffected. Consistent with a model of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion we expect that cohesin is loaded at the distal super enhancers and brings the enhancer and the promoter in close proximity. The reported enhancer-docking CTCF site in the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> likely plays a role in the interactions between the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter and the RhOMEs. To further understand enhancer selection in MRTs, a mechanistic study is required to delineate the regulome for each of the <italic>MYC</italic>-RhOME loops.</p><p id="P21">By inhibiting BRD9, and therefore repressing the activity of the non-canonical BAF complex, we could show that loss of the ncBAF complex has a similar effect as rescuing the cBAF complex. Therefore, MRT initiation during development might be dependent on the activity of the ncBAF complex. In addition to MRTs, several other pediatric cancers are characterized by aberrations in the BAF complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, BAF complex members are among the most commonly mutated genes in adult malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Using our study as a blueprint for other BAF complex-mutant cancers could shed light on the importance of intertumoral epigenetic heterogeneity to tumorigenesis and the therapeutic potential of ncBAF targeting on a broader scale.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P22">MRT tissues used for single-cell multiomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were obtained under approval by the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Princess Máxima Center for pediatric oncology (Utrecht, the Netherlands).
