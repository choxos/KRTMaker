These proteins must be co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane and are synthesized by the highly divergent trypanosomal mitoribosomes, which have a much higher protein to RNA ratio than any other ribosome. Here, we show that the trypanosomal ortholog of the mitoribosome receptor Mba1 (TbMba1) is essential for normal growth of procyclic trypanosomes but redundant in the bloodstream form, which lacks an oxidative phosphorylation system. Proteomic analyses of TbMba1-depleted mitochondria from procyclic cells revealed reduced levels of many components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, most of which belong to the cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) complex, three subunits of which are mitochondrially encoded. However, the integrity of the mitoribosome and its interaction with the inner membrane were not affected. Pulldown experiments showed that TbMba1 forms a dynamic interaction network that includes the trypanosomal Mdm38/Letm1 ortholog and a trypanosome-specific factor that stabilizes the CoxI and CoxII mRNAs. In summary, our study suggests that the function of Mba1 in the biogenesis of membrane subunits of OXPHOS complexes is conserved among yeast, mammalian, and trypanosomes, which belong to two eukaryotic supergroups.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mitochondria or mitochondria-derived organelles are a defining feature of eukaryotic cells. They originated from a single endosymbiotic event between an α-proteobacterium and an archaeal host cell, 1.7 to 2.1 billion years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. During the endosymbiont-to-mitochondria transition, most of the endosymbiont's genes were either lost or transferred to the genome of the host cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, a small number of genes were retained in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Thus, mitochondria contain a complete transcription and translation machinery, including ribosomes termed mitoribosomes.</p><p id="P4">Many of the genes that were retained in the mtDNA are highly hydrophobic core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Thus, the mtDNA of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> encodes for eight proteins, seven of which are hydrophobic components of the OXPHOS complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These proteins are co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IM) by the protein oxidase assembly 1 (Oxa1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, a homolog of the bacterial insertase YidC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Oxa1 has a large hydrophilic, matrix-facing C-terminal domain that was shown to be in close proximity to the mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs) uL23 and uL24 of the mitoribosomal large subunit (mt-LSU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This is in line with the fact that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> all mitoribosomes are associated with the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Interestingly, mitoribosomes remain associated with the IM even in the absence of Oxa1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, indicating that additional factors are involved in the IM association of mitoribosomes. Indeed, several such factors have been discovered. The first one identified, termed multi-copy bypass of AFG3 or (Mba1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, is peripherally associated with the IM on the matrix side and serves as a mitoribosome receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It is in close proximity to the MRPs uL22 and uL29<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and aligns the peptide exit tunnel of the mitoribosome with the insertion site of Oxa1 at the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Mba1 interacts with the mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein 38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (Mdm38, in other organisms referred to as Letm1), an integral IM protein also involved in the association of mitoribosomes with the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Mba1 and Mdm38 might additionally be involved in the recruitment of mRNA stabilization and translation factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Finally, the expansion segment 96-ES1 of the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA has also been shown to contribute to the IM association of mitoribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. An impaired co-translational IM integration leads to decreased activity of the OXPHOS complexes, since they rely on mitochondrially encoded subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

The arguably next best understood system concerning mitochondrial protein biogenesis, is the unicellular parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. It belongs to a different eukaryotic supergroup, called the Discoba, which is essentially unrelated to the Amorphea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Indeed, the work on mitochondrial protein biogenesis in <italic>T. brucei</italic> showed that, even though the general pathways are conserved, the involved complexes are astonishingly diverse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7"><italic>T. brucei</italic> undergoes a complex life cycle, during which it adapts to very different environments.

As in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, most of the genes encoded on the trypanosomal mtDNA, termed kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), are subunits of the OXPHOS complexes. 12 of the 18 protein-coding transcripts encode for subunits of the OXPHOS complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">On the other hand, the bloodstream form (BSF) of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, found in the blood of its mammalian host, produces energy by glycolysis using glucose as an energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

Here, we identify the protein Tb927.7.4620 as the trypanosomal ortholog of Mba1 (TbMba1). We present data showing that TbMba1 is essential for the maturation and/or stability of trypanosomal OXPHOS complexes. Furthermore, we show that it interacts with the trypanosomal ortholog of Letm1/Mdm38 and with the trypanosome-specific Tb927.11.16250, a stabilizing factor of the mitochondrial mRNAs encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CoxI) and CoxII.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tb927.7.4620 is an ortholog of yeast Mba1</title><p id="P10">A recent publication identified the <italic>Leishmania major</italic> protein Lmjf1.14.0080 as the ortholog of yeast Mba1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. <italic>L. major</italic>, like <italic>T. brucei</italic>, is a trypanosomatid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and thus belongs to the Discoba<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. When we did BLAST searches for the ortholog of Lmjf.14.0080 in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we identified Tb927.7.4620 as its homologue. Excluding the predicted N-terminal presequences (MitoProt II server: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html">https://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html</ext-link>), the two proteins show an identity of 62.5% and a similarity of 76.0% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1A</xref>). An alignment between Tb927.7.4620 and yeast Mba1 (Uniprot: P38300), excluding the predicted N-terminal presequences, reveals a 18.3% identity and 31.3% similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1B</xref>). This strongly suggests that Tb927.7.4620 is the Mba1 ortholog in <italic>T. brucei</italic> which is why we termed it TbMba1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TbMba1 is an essential membrane-associated mitochondrial protein in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic></title><p id="P11">To functionally analyse TbMba1, a <italic>T. brucei</italic> PCF cell line, allowing inducible RNA interference (RNAi) against the open reading frame (ORF) of TbMba1, was established. The growth of uninduced (-Tet) and induced (+Tet) RNAi cells was analysed over six days. The knockdown of TbMba1 in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic> led to a strong growth retardation starting after two days of induction, indicating that TbMba1 is essential for normal growth in this life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, depletion of Mba1 alone does not cause a growth defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we were able to generate a double knockout (dKO) <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF cell line, replacing the two alleles of TbMba1 with the antibiotic resistance cassettes of hygromycin and blasticidin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2A</xref>). TbMba1 is therefore not required for normal growth of BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> indicating it has a PCF specific function. This is in line with a previous study, which showed that TbMba1 expression is 11-fold lower in BSF cells when compared to the PCF of <italic>T. brucei</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">In a previous proteomics study, TbMba1 was shown to be mitochondrially localized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. To confirm this finding, TbMba1 was C-terminally myc-tagged (TbMba1-myc) and ectopically expressed in a PCF RNAi cell line targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the endogenous TbMba1 mRNA. This results in essentially exclusive expression of TbMba1-myc. TbMba1-myc complemented the growth phenotype caused by the depletion of the endogenous TbMba1, proving that the tag does not interfere with TbMba1 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2BC</xref>). Next, we analysed the localization of TbMba1-myc in the same cell line using immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. After two days of induction, TbMba1-myc localized to the reticulated mitochondrial structure spanning the whole cell of PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The very same structure was also stained by the mitochondrial marker atypical translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (ATOM40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Furthermore, the TbMba1-myc exclusive expressor cell line was subjected to a digitonin fractionation, in which a mitochondria-enriched pellet was separated from a soluble fraction enriched in cytosolic proteins. These fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and showed the expected co-fractionation of TbMba1-myc with ATOM40. The cytosolic marker eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1α (EF1α) however is exclusively detected in the cytosolic fraction, showing successful separation of organelles and cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, top panel</xref>). A fraction of the mitochondria-enriched pellet was subjected to an alkaline carbonate extraction at high pH, which allows separation of soluble proteins from membrane-integral proteins. After differential centrifugation, a large fraction of TbMba1-myc was recovered in the soluble fraction together with the peripheral membrane protein marker cytochrome c. However, a significant amount of the protein was also recovered in the membrane fraction (Mem) together with the integral membrane protein ATOM40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, middle panel</xref>). A subsequent Triton-X-100 extraction of the Mem fraction resulted in a complete solubilization of TbMba1-myc, showing that the fraction of TbMba1 present in the Mem sample was not aggregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, bottom panel</xref>). Thus, while most of TbMba1 is soluble, a smaller fraction appears to be associated with the membrane.</p><p id="P14">In summary, TbMba1 is essential for normal growth in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, but dispensable in the BSF. C-terminally myc-tagged TbMba1 is functional and localizes to the mitochondrion, where it seems to be peripherally associated with the mitochondrial membrane. Thus, it behaves similar as Mba1 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which is a peripheral IM protein that faces the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TbMba1 depletion preferentially affects OXPHOS components</title><p id="P15">In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Mba1 interacts with the mitoribosome aligning its exit tunnel with the IM insertase Oxa1 and mediates the integration of OXPHOS subunits into the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the loss of yeast Mba1 only causes a growth defect and inactivation of OXPHOS when Oxa1 is abolished at the same time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To determine the effect of TbMba1 ablation on a global level in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, a quantitative proteomic analysis of the steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins in the TbMba1 ORF RNAi cell line was performed. The cell line was grown under stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) conditions in medium containing different stable isotope-labelled forms of arginine and lysine. After three days of induction, equal cell numbers of induced and uninduced cultures, grown in presence of either light or heavy amino acids, were mixed. Mitochondria-enriched pellets were obtained by digitonin extraction and analysed by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). All proteins that were detected in at least two of three independent biological replicates and that have previously been identified to be mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> are depicted in the volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>.</p><p id="P16">The RNAi target, TbMba1, was downregulated 19-fold in one replicate, but not detected in the other two (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), it is therefore not depicted in the volcano plot. 23 mitochondrial proteins were significantly more than 1.5-fold downregulated. 14 of them (61%) are known components of OXPHOS complexes, according to Zíková <italic>et al</italic>. (2017)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and 12 of the 14 OXPHOS subunits are subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (Cox), also termed complex IV. Hence, the proteins most affected by downregulation of TbMba1 are predominantly complex IV subunits. Interestingly, none of the MRPs detected in the same analysis was downregulated more than 1.5-fold, suggesting that depletion of TbMba1 does not affect the integrity of the mitoribosomes. Of the other eight mitochondrial proteins (35%) that were significantly downregulated more than 1.5-fold, one is annotated as a nucleobase/nucleoside transporter 8.2 (Tb927.11.3620), one as a putative pteridine transporter (Tb927.10.9080), one as a putative amino acid transporter (Tb927.8.8300), and five are trypanosomatid-specific proteins (Tb927.7.7090, Tb927.10.6200, Tb927.10.4240, Tb927.5.2560, Tb927.11.16510).</p><p id="P17">Downregulation of complex IV was verified by analysing solubilized mitochondria-enriched fractions of uninduced and induced TbMba1 ORF RNAi cells by blue native (BN)-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using an antiserum specific against CoxIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Quantification of triplicate BN-PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) revealed a decreased signal to 67% after two days of RNAi induction. These results support that TbMba1, just as Mba1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is involved in the biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes.</p><p id="P18">To exclude that the observed loss of OXPHOS subunits is due to a possibly indirect decrease of mitochondrial protein import, whole cell samples were harvested every day over a six-day period after TbMba1 ORF RNAi induction and analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. CoxIV contains an N-terminal presequence that is cleaved off after successful import, resulting in a shorter mature protein. Accumulation of uncleaved CoxIV precursor in the cytosol is an established hallmark of a mitochondrial protein import defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. CoxIV immunoblots of whole cell extracts revealed an accumulation of CoxIV precursor after five days of TbMba1 ORF RNAi induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), three days after the onset of the growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This means that the subunits of the OXPHOS complexes, including the ones of complex IV, are depleted well before a mitochondrial protein import defect is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2ABC</xref>). Thus, TbMba1 seems to have a direct role in the biogenesis of OXPHOS subunits, but is not involved in mitochondrial protein import.</p><p id="P19">The biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes relies on the proper translation of mitochondrially encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes by the mitoribosome. Thus, similar phenotypes as the ones observed after downregulation of TbMba1 might also be expected when we directly interfere with mitochondrial translation. To test this, we knocked down TbMRPL22, a protein of the large subunit of the mitoribosome. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> shows that as expected for a MRP, this causes a growth retardation starting three days after induction. A SILAC-RNAi experiment with the TbMRPL22 ORF RNAi cell line, using the same procedure as explained above for the TbMba1 SILAC RNAi was done. The cells were harvested on day three after induction. All proteins that were detected in at least two of three independent biological replicates and that have previously been identified to be mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, are depicted in the volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>. TbMRPL22, the target of the RNAi, is efficiently downregulated more than tenfold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Moreover, 52 mitochondrial proteins were significantly downregulated more than 1.5-fold. As expected, many (29) of these proteins are MRPs suggesting that, in contrast to TbMba1 ablation, depletion of TbMRPL22 affects the integrity of the mitoribosomes. Of the remaining 23 proteins, 11 are OXPHOS subunits, of which nine belong to complex IV. Thus, in regard to OXPHOS components ablation of TbMRPL22 essentially matches the effects seen after depletion of TbMba1.</p><p id="P20">As discussed above, depletion of TbMba1 only marginally affects the levels of MRPs suggesting that the mitoribosomes are still intact. This allows to investigate whether they are still associated with the mitochondrial IM. To that end, we produced two TbMba1 ORF RNAi cell lines expressing in situ HA-tagged MRPs mL78 (mL78-HA) or L20 (L20-HA), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4AB</xref>). Mitochondria-enriched pellets of these two cell lines, obtained by digitonin extraction, were subjected to 15 freeze-thaw cycles followed by differential centrifugation to obtain a membrane (Mem) and a matrix (Mat) fraction. Subsequently, the fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The matrix protein TbmHsp70 and the IM protein TbTim17 were used as the matrix and membrane markers, respectively. Interestingly, both mL78-HA and L20-HA remained predominantly in the Mem fraction in both uninduced and up to six days induced cells. Thus, depletion of Mba1 is not sufficient to abolish the membrane-association of trypanosomal mitoribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">This suggests that <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitoribosomes use multiple factors to associate with the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> as is the case in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The essential function of TbMba1 goes therefore beyond contributing to a physical connection that associates the mitoribosome to the IM.</p><p id="P22">In summary, ablation of TbMba1 in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic> causes the depletion of OXPHOS components with a preference for complex IV subunits. This phenotype can be mimicked when mitochondrial translation is directly abolished by knockdown of the MRP TbMRPL22. Knockdown of TbMba1 however does neither affect steady-state levels of MRPs nor the physical connection of the mitoribosome with the IM.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TbMba1 interacts transiently with TbLetm1 and Tb927.11.16250</title><p id="P23">To find possible interaction partners, a SILAC-based quantitative MS analysis of a co-immunoprecipitation (SILAC-CoIP) was performed using the cell line that exclusively expresses TbMba1-myc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2C</xref>).

The bait TbMba1 was enriched 98-fold demonstrating that the CoIP has worked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). However, no other protein was enriched more than fivefold indicating that TbMba1 does not efficiently form a stable complex with other proteins.

Again, the bait TbMba1 was 100-fold enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). Moreover, six proteins were enriched between five- and ten-fold. One of the enriched proteins was previously identified as TbLetm1 (Tb927.3.4920), the <italic>T. brucei</italic> ortholog of yeast Mdm38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This is in line with the observation that in yeast, Mba1 and Mdm38 are interaction partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and suggests TbLetm1/Mdm38 might be involved in the biogenesis of mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS components. This is a novel function for TbLetm1 which was previously shown to be involved in K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

Thus, it is likely that TbLetm1 and yeast Mdm38 are functionally conserved. Another previously characterized protein that was enriched about ten-fold was the trypanosome-specific Tb927.11.16250<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> which contains two pentatricopeptide repeats (PPR) (150-210 aa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

Recent BLAST searches show that Tb927.11.16250 also contains a PilT N-terminus (PIN) domain (355-550 aa), which in many cases has endoribonuclease activity. Other enriched proteins include the trypanosomatid-specific mitochondrial proteins of unknown function Tb927.1.790, Tb927.10.9280 and Tb927.3.2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

The majority of the subunits of the OXPHOS complexes is encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, like most other mitochondrial proteins. However, genes encoding for the enzymatic core subunits of the OXPHOS system are often retained in the mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and the corresponding proteins are co-translationally inserted into the IM by membrane-associated mitoribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the interaction of the mitoribosomes with the IM is mediated by at least four factors: the insertase Oxa1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> via its C-terminus, the IM-associated Mba1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and the two integral IM proteins Mdm38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and Mrx15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Moreover, the expansion segment 96-ES1 of the mitochondrial 21S rRNA has also been shown to form a contact site with the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The four proteins mentioned above are widely conserved in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, indicating that they might already have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Here, we present a functional analysis of the trypanosomal Mba1 orthologue TbMba1. We show that TbMba1, as its yeast counterpart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, is a mitochondrially localized peripheral membrane protein. However, in contrast to yeast Mba1, whose absence resulted in a reduced growth rate on non-fermentable carbon sources only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, depletion of TbMba1 caused a strong reduction of growth of PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic> grown under standard condition in medium containing glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. This suggests that in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, TbMba1 has a more essential role than yeast Mba1, possibly compensating for the absence of a Mrx15 orthologue which surprisingly has not been detected in Euglenozoa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, a subgroup of the Discoba which includes <italic>T. brucei</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, even though it is found in essentially all other eukaryotic groups.</p><p id="P28">Depletion of TbMba1 causes reduced levels of many components of the OXPHOS system most of which are subunits of complex IV. The high sensitivity of complex IV to reduced TbMba1 levels can be explained by the fact that the <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitochondrial genome encodes three of its subunits (CoxI, II and III), whereas for the cytochrome bc1 complex, also termed complex III, and ATP synthase, also termed complex V, only a single subunit each is mitochondrially encoded. Interestingly, the steady state levels of MRPs remain unchanged in the absence of TbMba1 and so does the IM-association of the mitoribosomes. This suggests that the essential role of TbMba1 in PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic> is not connected to the integrity of the mitoribosomes but directly related to the co-translational integration of newly synthesized mitochondrially encoded proteins into the IM. This also indicates that while TbMba1 might contribute to the maintenance of a physical connection between mitoribosomes and the IM, this function is not essential.</p><p id="P29">Intriguingly, deleting both alleles of the TbMba1 gene does not affect growth of BSF trypanosomes. This makes sense since BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> does not express respiratory complexes I to IV and therefore cannot perform OXPHOS. Instead, BSF cells produce their ATP via glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, no co-translational integration into the IM of mitochondrially encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes is necessary. However, complex V is an exception, it is essential also in the BSF, not as an ATP synthase but as an enzyme that consumes ATP to maintain the membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. ATP synthase subunit a, also termed subunit 6, an essential component of the F<sub>o</sub> moiety of the ATP synthase, is mitochondrially encoded and therefore must be inserted into the IM even in the absence of TbMba1. In yeast, IM insertion of ATPase subunit 6 is mainly mediated by Mdm38 in concert with Oxa1. Since orthologues of these two proteins are found in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitochondrion, the same may be the case for the trypanosomal ATP synthase subunit a.</p><p id="P30">The mitoribosomes of trypanosomes are very unusual. They have among the shortest known rRNAs of any translation system and 127 MRPs, a number that is much higher than that of any other ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Half of these proteins are specific for trypanosomes and its relatives.

It is possible that this region of the highly diverged trypanosomal mitoribosome is more restricted to evolutionary change because the association with the IM, which must be maintained for efficient co-translational IM integration, is based on conserved proteins like Mba1 and Oxa1.</p><p id="P31">Pulldown experiments using the cell line exclusively expressing tagged TbMba1 did not recover any proteins that were more than five-fold enriched suggesting that TbMba1 does not form a stable complex with other proteins. Thus, in agreement with the cryo-EM structure of the trypanosomal mitoribosome, TbMba1 itself is not a component of the mitoribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. TbMba1 therefore behaves similarly to yeast Mba1 and differs from the mammalian Mba1 orthologue mL45, which is firmly integrated into the large mitoribosomal subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. TbMba1 however transiently interacts with five mitochondrial proteins, all of which were more than five-fold enriched in the postmix pulldown experiment. One of these proteins is TbLetm1, whose yeast orthologue Mdm38 was shown to function in the same processes as Mba1. The other previously characterized factor was Tb927.11.16250, a protein containing two PPR and a PIN domain, whose depletion specifically destabilizes CoxI and CoxII mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. This is in line with the observation that Mdm38 in yeast is involved in the recruitment of mRNA stabilization and translation factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and suggests that TbLetm1 might be involved in recruitment of Tb927.11.16250. Thus, Mba1, TbLetm1, Tb927.11.16250<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and possibly three other trypanosome-specific proteins of unknown function form a dynamic network that mediates and regulates co-translational insertion of OXPHOS complex subunits.</p><p id="P32">Thus, despite the highly diverged mitoribosome, the role of trypanosomal Mba1 and possibly Letm1 in mediating co-translational IM insertion of subunits of the OXPHOS system appears to be largely conserved between yeast and trypanosomes.

Immunoblot analysis using anti-myc antibody to detect TbMba1-myc was performed. Anti-ATOM40 and anti-EF1α antibodies were used to detect a mitochondrial and cytosolic control, respectively. Alkaline carbonate extraction: A digitonin-extracted mitochondrial fraction was generated and solubilized in an alkaline carbonate extraction at pH 11.5. Differential centrifugation resulted in a pellet (Mem) and soluble (S) fraction that were analysed by immunoblotting. Anti-myc antibody was used to detect TbMba1-myc. Anti-ATOM40 and anti-Cytochrome c antibodies were used as controls for a membrane integral and membrane-associated protein, respectively. Triton extraction: Half of the Mem fraction from the alkaline carbonate extraction was solubilized in 1% triton. Differential centrifugation resulted in a pellet (P) and soluble (SN) fraction.
