Notably, <italic>in silico</italic> models are regarded as powerful tools to further understand the signaling pathways that regulate this intricate spatial cellular interplay. To this end, we have established a 3D multiscale micro-multiphysics agent-based (micro-MPA) <italic>in silico</italic> model of trabecular bone remodeling using longitudinal <italic>in vivo</italic> data from the sixth caudal vertebra (CV6) of PolgA<sup>(D257A/D257A)</sup> mice, a mouse model of premature aging. Our model includes a variety of cells as single agents and receptor-ligand kinetics, mechanomics, diffusion and decay of cytokines which regulate the cells’ behavior. We highlighted its capabilities by simulating trabecular bone remodeling in the CV6 of 5 mice over 4 weeks and we evaluated the static and dynamic morphometry of the trabecular bone microarchitecture. Based on the progression of the average trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), we identified a configuration of the model parameters to simulate homeostatic trabecular bone remodeling, here named basal. Crucially, we also produced anabolic, anti-anabolic, catabolic and anti-catabolic responses with an increase or decrease by one standard deviation in the levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), and sclerostin (Scl) produced by the osteocytes. Our results showed that changes in the levels of OPG and RANKL were positively and negatively correlated with the BV/TV values after 4 weeks in comparison to basal levels, respectively. Conversely, changes in Scl levels produced small fluctuations in BV/TV in comparison to the basal state. From these results, Scl was deemed to be the main driver of equilibrium while RANKL and OPG were shown to be involved in changes in bone volume fraction with potential relevance for age-related bone features. Ultimately, this micro-MPA model provides valuable insights into how cells respond to their local mechanical environment and can help to identify critical pathways affected by degenerative conditions and ageing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>micro-FE</kwd><kwd>bone adaptation</kwd><kwd>mechanical signal</kwd><kwd>numerical simulations</kwd><kwd>bone cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">With aging, bone becomes more fragile with increasing fracture risk, leading to an increased morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kanis et al. 2021</xref>). To better understand how aging affects bone cellular behavior, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> studies have been used to analyze the tissue and cellular properties of bone mechanobiology. It is known that bone remodeling is regulated by the interaction between different cells and tissues (i.e. cancellous, cortical and marrow tissues) across many spatial and temporal scales. Hybrid modeling has been identified as a powerful modeling technique which combines multiscale, multiphysics, and agent-based modeling to analyze in a unified way the organ, tissue, cell, and gene scales over weeks, months or even years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boaretti et al. 2022</xref>). Such an <italic>in silico</italic> model can deal with the action of single cells while millions of cells are active and interact with each other in a multiscale simulation, making this tool ideal to explore the hierarchical processes governing bone mechanobiology. Furthermore, by enabling fine modelling of signaling pathways that regulate the cells’ activity, such models can help to estimate physiological cytokine production rates and explore their effect on spatial cellular distribution, bone formation, and bone resorption, which is hardly feasible <italic>in vivo</italic>. Yet, bone remodeling has not been quantitatively studied <italic>in silico</italic> across spatial and temporal scales and using 3D <italic>in vivo</italic> data as reference.</p><p id="P3">Recent experimental studies have analyzed the effects of aging in mice and how mechanical loading can counterbalance frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Scheuren et al. 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">b</xref>). Accelerated aging was provoked in PolgA<sup>(D257A/D257A)</sup> mice due to systemic mitochondrial dysfunction caused by accumulation of mitochondrial DNA point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Trifunovic et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kujoth et al. 2005</xref>). The findings from these publications have mainly focused on cortical and trabecular bone morphometric parameters with analyses of selected gene and protein expression on specific time points. The study of Dobson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dobson et al. 2020</xref>) showed that in this PolgA<sup>(D257A/D257A)</sup> mouse model, osteoblast density was reduced and the production of mineralized matrix by osteoblasts was significantly impaired, leading to reduced bone formation rates. The mechanisms which lead to cellular alterations in bone with aging remain to be further elucidated.</p><p id="P4">We have recently proposed an <italic>in silico</italic> multiscale micro-multiphysics agent-based (micro-MPA) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Boaretti et al. 2018</xref>) adapted from the model of fracture healing in cortical bone by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Tourolle (2019)</xref>. This micro-MPA model was based on multiscale (from the organ to the protein spatial scales and from weeks to minutes as temporal scales), multiphysics (mechanical signal, reaction-diffusion-decay of cytokines), and agent-based modeling (single-cell behavior). Each cell was represented as a single agent, and signaling pathways were modeled to regulate the cell behavior with distinct expression and bone remodeling profiles dependent on the mechanical signal which we define as mechanomics. Crucially, this enabled simulating the movement, differentiation, cluster behavior, apoptosis of bone cells, their response to the local mechanical environment in terms of synthesis of cytokines and bone remodeling in the trabecular region, employing the same isotropic voxel resolution of the 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) <italic>in vivo</italic> data. In this model, osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), sclerostin (Scl) were cytokines that decayed, diffused in the volume, and were produced by the cells. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was modeled as cytokine stored in the bone volume and it could diffuse and decay after resorption. The signaling pathways were modeled with receptor-ligand kinetics, with the receptors located on the cells’ surfaces. In addition, a free ligand could bind to another free ligand, e.g., OPG can bind to RANKL. These pathways have been shown to be the main regulators of cell differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Krishnan et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boyce and Xing 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lin et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Tang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Warren et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Elson et al. 2022</xref>). The osteocytes were considered the main mechanosensors of the mechanical signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Santos et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klein-Nulend et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">2013</xref>) and they promoted bone formation or resorption by releasing cytokines into the volume to regulate the signaling pathways affecting eventually the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These cells formed and resorbed bone on the surface, respectively. Osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts were the basis for the regulation of bone remodeling we could simulate using <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Indeed, a previous version of this model was used for simulating denosumab treatment in human biopsies over 10 years, showing the potential of micro-MPA models for designing optimal clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Tourolle et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In the current study, we present an updated micro-MPA model to simulate how bone adapts and remodels through single-cell mechanomics in mice. We hypothesized that cells produce cytokines to regulate the cellular actions as a response to the local mechanical signal they perceive, e.g., osteocytes and osteoblasts release cytokines to promote anabolic or anti-catabolic responses under high effective strain (EFF) and osteocytes and osteoblasts release catabolic or anti-anabolic cytokines under low EFF. This hypothesis is implemented with an adaptation of the bone microarchitecture through an EFF-based sigmoidal dose-response mechanomics at the cellular level. Furthermore, we hypothesized that osteocytes are mainly responsible for regulating the other cells’ activity through their single-cell mechanomics.</p><p id="P6">The aim of this study is to show that the proposed <italic>in silico</italic> model can reproduce a homeostatic condition similar to the longitudinal <italic>in vivo</italic> data, where a dynamic equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption maintains relatively constant bone volume fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rodan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nakahama 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rauner et al. 2020</xref>). Moreover, we investigated the quantitative effect of manipulating the cytokines levels involved in the signaling pathways on the bone morphometric parameters. For this purpose, the proposed novel micro-MPA <italic>in silico</italic> model of bone remodeling was applied to micro-CT <italic>in vivo</italic> data to test the effect of different production values of RANKL, OPG, and Scl by osteocytes on the static and dynamic bone morphometry data relatively to the homeostatic configuration.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> input data</title><p id="P7"><italic>In vivo</italic> data of the control group of a study analyzing the effects of frailty and osteosarcopenia on the bone microarchitecture of prematurely aged PolgA<sup>(D257A/D257A)</sup> mice (n=9) were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Scheuren et al. 2020a</xref>). Briefly, at an age of 35 weeks, stainless steel pins were inserted at the sixth caudal vertebra (CV6). At week 38, a sham (0N control) loading regime was applied three times per week over 4 weeks. Specifically, mice were placed on the loading machine for 5 minutes, without any mechanical loading. The <italic>in vivo</italic> micro-CT images (vivaCT 40, Scanco Medical AG) were acquired and analyzed every week at an isotropic voxel resolution of 10.5 um. The acquired images showed a slight reduction in the normalized trabecular bone volume fraction over the course of the experiment (2% at the end). All mouse experiments reported in the present study were previously carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations and regulations in the Animal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV 455.1) of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, and results are reported following the principles of the ARRIVE guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines">www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>In silico</italic> micro-multiphysics agent-based model</title><p id="P8">In the present study, we adapted the micro-MPA model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Tourolle et al.

The model implements the actions of each cell according to the local physiological, chemical, and mechanical environment at the cellular spatial and temporal scale. In our implementation, the changes in the bone microarchitecture are accumulated over the whole time of the experiment (4 weeks) which is much longer than the single temporal step of the cells (40 minutes). The model simulated bone remodeling only within the trabecular region, while the cortical region was kept constant during the simulation, as performed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Schulte et al. 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Levchuk et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Levchuk 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Modeling the cellular behavior</title><p id="P10">Osteocytes (Ot) are embedded in bone and produce RANKL, OPG, and Scl depending on the local mechanical signal they perceive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Santos et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klein-Nulend et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">2013</xref>). Osteoblasts (Ob) produce osteoid, unmineralized matrix, in their neighborhood towards the surface of the bone, based on the local EFF they perceive. Moreover, Ob may become pre-Ot when the voxel they reside in is at least 50% full of osteoid and there is an osteocyte in the normal direction towards the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Franz-Odendaal et al. 2006</xref>). Lining cells are considered osteoblasts precursors. In addition, Ob and lining cells also produce OPG and RANKL according to the mechanical signal they perceive. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are present in the marrow space where they can move, proliferate, undergo apoptosis, and can differentiate into an Ob or a lining cell if they are close to the surface and close to an osteoclast (Oc). MSC, lining cells, and Ob have the Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) receptor which binds to Scl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Li et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bourhis et al. 2011</xref>). If the bound receptor is higher than a user-defined threshold value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), Ob differentiate into lining cell and MSC differentiate into lining cell if they meet the condition mentioned above. MSC and Ob have also the TGF-β1 receptor on their surface, and if that receptor is highly bound then they can proliferate more frequently. Pre-Ot differentiate into Ot if the voxel they reside in is at least 50% full of mineralized matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Franz-Odendaal et al. 2006</xref>). The hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are present in the marrow space, they can move, proliferate, undergo apoptosis and differentiate into pre-Oc if their RANK receptors are highly bound to RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Nelson et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Warren et al. 2015</xref>). Pre-Oc are motile and can differentiate back into HSCs if the RANK receptor is not highly bound. Moreover, they can differentiate into Oc if there are at least 3 osteoclastic cells (pre-Oc or Oc) in their neighborhood. Oc resorb bone towards the bone surface, with the direction defined by the gradient of the mineral concentration. We calibrated the original implementation of the mineralization kinetics by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Tourolle (2019)</xref> to have more stable formation rates for simulations of bone remodeling over 4 weeks. We modeled the mineralization kinetics of the matrix in each voxel by changing its mineral concentration to reach its osteoid concentration.

With this mineralization rule, the mineral concentration can increase over the iterations if there is a higher concentration of osteoid than the mineral concentration in that voxel, therefore the upper limit of the mineral concentration with this mineralization rule is the osteoid concentration at that voxel. However, the osteoid can increase if there are any osteoblasts in that neighborhood that can release osteoid around themselves. Therefore, given a voxel, if there is more osteoid than mineral, the mineral concentration will increase and if there is more mineral than osteoid, the mineral concentration will decrease. In this way, when Ob release osteoid, there is a delay in bone formation because osteoid leads to a change in the mineral concentration through the mineralization process. In this model, if pre-Ot becomes Ot because the mineral concentration is at least 0.5, that voxel where the cell is present is considered bone, but its mineral concentration does not jump to 100%.</p><p id="P11">To simulate trabecular bone remodeling, we modeled TGF-β1, RANKL-RANK-OPG, and LRP5/6-Scl signaling pathways at the receptor-ligand level and the Ob, lining cell, Oc, pre-Oc, Ot, pre-Ot, MSC, HSC at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Application of the model to simulate bone remodeling in mouse vertebrae</title><p id="P12">The overview of the simulation model can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>.

We considered the grayscale bone density values from 0.5 to 1 as bone tissue. The minimum value of 0.5 corresponds to a bone density value of 580 mg HA/cm<sup>3</sup> which is the same threshold value employed previously for the postprocessing of the original corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Scheuren et al. 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The mechanical signal was obtained using the micro-finite element analysis (micro-FE). For this purpose, we assumed bone tissue to be an isotropic, homogenous material.

At the proximal and distal ends of the micro-FE model, two cylindrical discs were added to simulate the presence of the intervertebral discs (IVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Webster et al. 2008</xref>). The nodes at the proximal end of the micro-FE mesh were set to have 0 displacements in all directions, while a displacement of 1% along the longitudinal axis of the micro-FE model was set for the nodes at the distal end. From this analysis, the strain energy density (SED, in MPa) was computed, from which EFF was derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Pistoia et al. 2002</xref>) after rescaling to match the forces applied <italic>in vivo</italic>, which amounts to 4 N for physiological loading in the sham-loaded group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Christen et al. 2012</xref>).

In a first step, the greatest connected component (GCC) of the vertebra was defined. The bone phase of the trabecular region (bone mineral density greater than 580 mg HA/cm<sup>3</sup>), was then used for setting the initial mineral and osteoid concentrations to 1. The marrow of the trabecular region was seeded randomly with MSCs and HSCs, with a density of 1.25 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml for each of these two cell types. Ob and Oc were seeded randomly occupying a portion of the bone surface. The binding sites of the cells were modified to make the multicellular system closer to a real state, where the cells’ receptors are partially or fully bound. Ot were seeded using an exponential distribution to have more osteocytes embedded deeper in bone rather than close to the bone surface. The seeding of all cells in a cross-sectional slice can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. The cytokines were calibrated after running simulations and checking whether the cells would reside and be active in corresponding biochemical regions, e.g. Oc resorb bone and lining cells are present mainly in low strain regions whereas Ob release osteoid primarily in high strain regions.

BV/TV with lower values when OPG was lower and higher values when OPG was higher (p&lt;0.01 for the group comparison high OPG-basal OPG, basal OPG-low OPG and p&lt;0.0001 for the interaction time-group), see Figure 4B. Norm. Tb.Th. showed no significant difference for the interaction time-group, however the values computed with lower OPG were significantly lower than the values using high and basal OPG levels (p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high OPG-low OPG and basal OPG-low OPG). Norm. BS/BV showed an inverse relationship with the OPG levels (p &lt; 0.01 and p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high OPG-basal OPG and basal OPG-low OPG, respectively). In addition, Norm. BS/BV showed different curves over time (p&lt;0.05 for the interaction time-group). Norm. BS/TV, Norm. Tb.Sp and Norm. Tb.N were not affected by the changes in OPG levels (n.s. between groups and for the interaction time-group). BFR was not significantly affected by the variations in OPG with a similar slightly decreasing trend over time among the three levels. The BRR and ES showed a similar variability of Norm. BS/BV, with lower values when OPG was higher and higher values when OPG was lower (p&lt;0.01 for the group comparison high OPG-low OPG and p&lt;0.05 for the other group comparisons). The significance of these changes was observed for both BRR and ES over time between groups data (p&lt;0.05 for the interaction time-group). MS showed significantly different values between groups (p&lt;0.05), however only the comparisons of high OPG-basal OPG and basal OPG-low OPG showed significant differences between the groups (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively). MAR and MRR did not show differences among the groups when the OPG production level was changed in the simulations. These results suggest that OPG produced by the osteocytes can inhibit the osteoclasts recruitment and the consequent amount of resorption by the available osteoclasts. In addition, the number of osteoclasts also influenced the number of active osteoblasts, as shown by the variability of the MS. The net effect of these changes has an impact on the static parameters, primarily on Norm. BV/TV where the homeostatic balance is lost with alterations of the OPG levels.</p><p id="P35">Second, the variation of RANKL levels produced by the osteocytes led to a different bone remodeling activity from the osteoblasts and osteoclasts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Similar to the variations observed for OPG, we observed primarily a lower or higher catabolic activity when RANKL in the distal end of the CV6 was reduced or increased respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. This cell activity was reflected in the Norm. BV/TV, Norm. Tb.Th. with lower values when RANKL was higher and higher values when RANKL was lower (p&lt;0.001 for the group comparison high RANKL-low RANKL, p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high RANKL-basal RANKL respectively, p&lt;0.01 and n.s. for the group comparison basal RANKL-low RANKL respectively, p&lt;0.0001 for the interaction time-group), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. Norm. BS/TV did not respond differently to higher or lower RANKL values over time and the average values over time were not statistically significantly different (n.s. between groups and for the interaction time-group). Norm. BS/BV, Norm. Tb.N and BRR and ES were lower when RANKL was lower and they were higher when RANKL was higher (p&lt;0.05 between groups, for all possible group comparisons and for the interaction time-group; detailed significances in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). Norm. Tb.Sp was not affected by the changes in RANKL over time and its average value was not affected (n.s. between groups and for the interaction time-group). The changes in RANKL had an impact on BFR, with higher or lower values when RANKL was higher or lower, respectively (p&lt;0.01 between groups and for the interaction time-group). The only comparison which did not show a significant difference in BFR was between high and basal levels of RANKL. BRR was also affected by the changes in RANKL in a similar way (p&lt;0.001 for the group comparison high RANKL-low RANKL and basal RANKL-low RANKL, p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high RANKL-basal RANKL, and p&lt;0.001 for the interaction time-group). MAR and MRR did not show differences among the groups with changing RANKL production levels. These results suggest that RANKL promoted the osteoclasts differentiation by the changes of ES which in turn led to changes in resorption. The changes in the Ob recruitment are reflected in the extent of the formed surface by the Ob. The change in the formed surface had a cumulative effect on different values of BFR. The net effect of these changes had an impact on the static parameters, with the parameters starting to differ from the basal condition earlier compared to OPG, thus augmenting the separation from the homeostatic condition.</p><p id="P36">Finally, the variation of Scl levels produced by the osteocytes led to a different bone remodeling activity from the osteoblasts and osteoclasts compared to what was observed for the variations of RANKL and OPG before, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. In the proximal end of the CV6 we observed primarily higher or lower anabolic activity of the osteoblasts when Scl was reduced or increased respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>. Therefore, bone formation was affected, and a similar effect was observed in the Norm. BV/TV with lower values when Scl was higher, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>. Indeed, the variations of Scl were statistically significant for Norm. BV/TV when comparing high and low Scl values as well as high and basal Scl values (p&lt;0.01). However, their curves were not significantly different over time (n.s. for the interaction time-group). The statistical findings for Norm. BV/TV also apply to Norm. Tb.Th which slightly decreased over time and stabilized afterwards with a high Scl level whereas it increased when Scl was basal or lower (p&lt;0.05 for the group comparisons high-low and high-basal).</p><p id="P37">Conversely, Norm. BS/BV and Norm. BS/TV increased over time. The statistical significance of the variations for Norm BS/BV was the same as of Norm. BV/TV (except for p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high Scl-basal Scl), whereas Norm BS/TV showed differences only in the group comparison high-basal (p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, no increase in the Norm. BV/TV was observed for lower values of Scl. The temporal evolution of Norm. Tb.Sp and Norm. Tb.N did not present significant differences between the variations of Scl (n.s. for the interaction time-group); Norm. Tb.N was not affected on average by different levels of Scl (n.s. between groups) while Norm. Tb. Sp was only affected by higher values of Scl when compared to basal values of Scl (p&lt;0.05 for the group comparison high Scl-basal Scl). BFR showed a significant variability due to Scl (p&lt;0.05 between groups) but only in the comparisons high-low and high-basal. Also, MS was affected by the variations of Scl in a more evident way (p&lt;0.01 for the group comparison high Scl-basal Scl and p&lt;0.05 for the other group comparisons). Scl did not change how bone was deposited by osteoblasts and this outcome was visible from the absence of variability in MAR with different Scl values (n.s. between groups and for the interaction time-group). BRR, MRR and ES did not show differences when Scl levels changed, nor its effect was significantly visible over time (n.s. between groups and for the interaction time-group). The changes in Scl levels had a net effect on the Norm. BV/TV less visible compared to the changes in OPG and RANKL levels, with a temporal separation from the homeostatic range of values similar to the OPG case.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">The proposed <italic>in silico</italic> micro-MPA model successfully simulated trabecular bone remodeling to evaluate the static and dynamic morphometry of the trabecular bone microarchitecture. We demonstrated that our model can simulate a homeostatic response similar to that observed with <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Although some morphological aspects were not captured by the simulations, our model showed adaptation towards a normalized trabecular bone fraction in all samples. Furthermore, the variability observed <italic>in vivo</italic> was also partially reflected in our simulations. Nonetheless, these differences must be understood in the context of a novel multiscale micro-MPA model of trabecular bone remodeling that demonstrates for the first time physiological behavior of the cells, where group averages of key static morphometric parameters (trabecular bone volume fraction and thickness) follow <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Capturing the static parameters with <italic>in silico</italic> models has been proven to be challenging and the most frequent parameter to be captured was BV/TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Schulte et al. 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Levchuk et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Levchuk 2015</xref>). This parameter did not show significant differences on average between the <italic>in silico</italic> and the <italic>in vivo</italic> values, whereas Tb.Sp and Tb.N were different in our simulations compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Our simulations showed a similar evolution pattern of the static bone morphometric parameters across the samples in the second half of the simulation, meaning that it was capable to simulate similar bone changes for a group of samples with limited variability in the output. The single-cell activity and the signaling pathways were additional information modeled and they could be further tuned to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of the bone microarchitectures. With this model, it is possible to test hypothesis or translate findings from other studies to improve the fidelity and the match against experimental data, e.g. considering fluid flow inside the lacunocanalicular network improves prediction of bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">van Tol et al. 2020</xref>). This study might be considered a step further in modeling the action of single cells and the signaling pathways compared to models of bone remodeling based on systemic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) where the spatial information of the cells is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buenzli et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Pastrama et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Martin et al. 2019</xref>). With this model, it will be possible to quantitatively investigate the mechanobiological properties at the cellular and protein levels that are associated with ageing in mice and in the future to use the 3R principles to replace, reduce and refine such animal models.</p><p id="P39">Tb.N, Tb.Th and Tb.Sp could be dependent on the single-cell movement, apposition and resorption rates by osteoblasts and osteoclasts as well as by the mineralizing and eroded surface. The single-cell movement was modeled with migration towards regions of higher or lower strains for the osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Such migration can lead to bone formation and bone resorption patterns that can alter the morphology of the microarchitecture and the extent of the remodeled surface to adapt to the local perceived strains. Further, the mineral apposition and resorption rates had to be higher to reduce the difference between <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation and resorption rates. Eventually, trabecular parameters would be affected by these changes resulting from more accentuated local remodeling. If MAR, MRR, MS and ES were closer to the <italic>in vivo</italic> values, the static trabecular parameters could have better followed the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> values. However, this aspect should be further inspected because, for example, the <italic>in silico</italic> model of Levchuk and colleagues captured Tb.N, Tb.Th and Tb.Sp despite a significant discrepancy in dynamic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Levchuk et al. 2014</xref>), while the model of Schulte and colleagues for ovariectomy and loading captured some dynamic parameters and BV/TV but not Tb.N, Tb.Th and Tb.Sp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Schulte et al. 2013b</xref>). In the model presented, the regulation of the dynamic parameters was not trivial because the mineralizing and eroded surfaces were not easy to capture due to the complex interplay between the mechanical environment, the mechanomics and the subsequent cascade in the signaling process to regulate osteoblasts and osteoclasts activity. The remodeled regions were rather large <italic>in silico</italic> compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> which were more scattered throughout the trabecular volume. Thus, the trabecular remodeling by the single cells was less localized <italic>in silico</italic>.</p><p id="P40">Our proposed cluster analysis of the osteocytes was different compared to previous experimental approaches, where the osteocytes were obtained only at the end of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Trüssel 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Paul 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Scheuren 2020</xref>). In those approaches, the backward correlation of bone remodeling events with the final osteocyte population can show only the final distribution of the osteocytes. Conversely, the clustering analysis applied here allowed the selection of a section of interest and the study of the osteocyte population available at the beginning of the study. The clustering analysis identified one cluster (Cluster 1) where the cells showed a higher probability of high mechanical signal and bone formation events. Cluster 2 was characterized by higher levels of RANKL and Scl, a higher probability of low mechanical signal and higher probability of bone resorption within the cluster. Taken together, these findings confirmed the regulation of the pathways from tissue to cell scales, in alignment with the current observations that high mechanical signal is associated with lower expression of RANKL and Scl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Robling et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Galea et al. 2020</xref>), higher expression of OPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">You et al. 2008</xref>) and higher bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Schulte et al. 2013a</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We demonstrated OPG inhibits excessive osteoclastic bone resorption as it was observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kramer et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cawley et al. 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cawley et al. (2020)</xref> showed OPG to be secreted by osteoblasts whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kramer et al. (2010)</xref> found osteocytes to be the cells mainly producing OPG. Our analysis highlighted osteocytes are the cells responsible for the production of RANKL and the subsequent recruitment of osteoclasts and increase of bone resorption, as it was shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nakashima et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Xiong et al. 2015</xref>). In our study, osteocytes were also identified as sources of sclerostin inhibiting the osteoblastic activity and therefore reducing bone formation. This finding was experimentally obtained also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Van Bezooijen et al. (2004)</xref>, where sclerostin protein was found to be expressed by osteocytes and not by osteoclasts in cortical and trabecular bone. Further, they also observed the inhibitory effect of sclerostin on osteoblasts, confirming its importance for regulating bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Winkler et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Li et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Colucci et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P42">We observed that affecting the catabolic response would also imply a change in the anabolic activity. This aspect was evident from the variations of RANKL and OPG which had a direct impact on the osteoclasts’ activity and subsequently affecting the osteoblasts’ activity. Besides, the anti-anabolic response would also imply a subsequent change in the catabolic activity, as it was seen from the variations of Scl which inhibited osteoblasts and a consequent slower resorption activity. The variations in the RANKL, OPG and Scl did not lead to proportional changes in MS because of the dynamic equilibrium the cells can reach, meaning that the levels of cytokines can result in a non-linear response in the amount of mineralized surface. These findings agree with the coupling between bone formation and bone resorption events as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our <italic>in silico</italic> model represented bone formation mostly occurring over time in the same region where the strains were high, until the osteoblasts de-differentiated into lining cells or became embedded into the osteoid and differentiate into preosteocytes. On the other hand, bone resorption started from regions where strains were low, which also had higher RANKL, leading to more prominent recruiting of osteoclasts. TGF-β1 is thought to be responsible for coupling bone resorption and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Raggatt and Partridge 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kasagi and Chen 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weivoda et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Durdan et al. 2022</xref>) and osteoclasts resorb bone in regions of low strains. MSCs proliferated closer to osteoclasts due to the presence of TGF-β1 being released upon resorption in these regions of low strains. In addition, in such regions, sclerostin was also produced by osteocytes to inhibit bone formation by the osteoblasts. Therefore, the osteoblastic differentiation of such cells was inhibited and MSCs would directly differentiate into lining cells instead of osteoblasts in these regions of low strains.</p><p id="P43">It is not yet fully understood when the osteoclasts stop resorbing bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Filgueira 2010</xref>), but it is assumed that this happens when the mineral phase of the bone underneath is degraded to a certain extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kanehisa and Heersche 1988</xref>). Currently, this mechanism is not reproduced directly in the <italic>in silico</italic> model. However, our model can produce realistic osteoclast cell behavior. These cells have been shown to alternate bone resorption and migration on the bone surface known as pit mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Delaisse et al. 2021</xref>). In our <italic>in silico</italic> model, osteoclasts stopped being active, and therefore resorptive, when they were not in a cluster or if they died by apoptosis or due to lack of bound RANK receptors. Further, the resorption rate of mineral and collagen by osteoclasts was considered the same. This is the case when osteoclasts resorb bone while moving on the bone surface known as trench mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Delaisse et al. 2021</xref>). Conversely, these rates are usually different when osteoclasts resorb bone in pit mode, with solubilization of mineral being faster than the evacuation of collagen fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Delaisse et al. 2021</xref>). The modelling of these events might be an oversimplification of how osteoclasts stop being active and it does not represent the same frequency of interruption of bone resorption by osteoclasts.</p><p id="P44">On a different note, our model did not investigate cortical remodeling because it was shown that its mechanical control is different from the control in the trabecular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pearson and Lieberman 2004</xref>) and their mineralization and turnover rates are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lerebours et al. 2020</xref>), hence the model could not capture the changes in cortical bone using the same rules and parameters for trabecular bone.</p><p id="P45">For initializing the cytokines in the model, we used values measured from experimental studies which are closely in line with the modelled environment. However, it is likely that the values appropriate for the mouse vertebra at a given age might differ from the experimental values due to site, age, loading and phenotypic characterization of the data. This problem has been identified for <italic>in silico</italic> models of bone mechanobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Checa and Prendergast 2009</xref>), where simple approaches were adopted to overcome this lack of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Perier-Metz et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borgiani et al. 2021</xref>). This limitation might be partially overcome by taking advantage of the mechanical environment as it was performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Tourolle et al. (2021)</xref>. A more synergistic study where the cytokines are experimentally obtained from the same site on a regular basis would help in the calibration of this micro-MPA <italic>in silico</italic> model. In addition, the information on the cell densities is scarce and they might change between different bones, age, sex, and physiological conditions. Moreover, the cells might be distributed differently in bone and in the marrow. This aspect is especially relevant for osteocytes which are not motile in bone, meaning that their initial distribution is essentially preserved throughout the time of the simulation, except when they are no longer present due to cell apoptosis or bone resorption. The initial cell densities and cytokine distributions will have implications in the estimations of the proliferation and cell rates as well as the single-cell activity, e.g., resorption and cytokine production rates. Consequently, the amount of unknown initial conditions is very high, and it can take some time before the simulated cells and cytokines can reach a realistic spatio-temporal distribution, with minimal influence of the assumed initial condition. This limitation was addressed by the additional iterations of the model first without changes and then with changes to the bone microarchitecture. However, the number of iterations required for this purpose could be even higher.</p><p id="P46">The receptor-ligand kinetics in the context of micro-MPA <italic>in silico</italic> models is still very novel and needs further exploration. Depending on the application, the formulations might differ to include other aspects like trafficking and intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cilfone et al. 2015</xref>). Moreover, there might be molecular aspects that might be lost when using this kind of equation and coefficients might be recalibrated depending on the environment. Indeed, some coefficients might be experimentally obtained from analysis of the interactions between monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Nelson et al. 2012</xref>), but their usage might not be straightforward due to the coexistence of other phenomena like spatial diffusion and movement of the ligands from one receptor to the other in the proximity of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Erbaş et al. 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the cell response is usually achieved when most of its surface receptors are still unoccupied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lodish et al. 1999</xref>). It is still difficult to estimate <italic>in vivo</italic> the number of surface receptors and the number of occupied receptors along with an accurate description of the receptor-ligand kinetics, especially when competitive reactions are involved, e.g., the RANKL-RANK-OPG axis. Hence, the receptor-ligand kinetics in bone remodeling remains challenging but crucial. Nonetheless, it is our belief that the sensitivity analysis of protein expression presented can encourage more complex approaches such as uncertainty quantification, for calibration and estimation of more realistic model parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Geris and Gomez-Cabrero 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gomez-Cabrero et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Viceconti et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hamis et al. 2021</xref>). Ultimately, we expect these could have direct benefits in the quality of the simulation output.</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P47">This study showcases the use of single-cell mechanomics in a micro-MPA <italic>in silico</italic> model of trabecular bone remodeling applied to <italic>in vivo</italic> data. We were able to reproduce homeostatic bone remodeling and highlight how tuning the single-cell osteocyte production rates of OPG, RANKL and Scl further induces anabolic, anti-anabolic, catabolic and anti-catabolic responses from the baseline model. Specifically, OPG and RANKL levels altered the homeostatic remodeling around the equilibrium value of the average trabecular bone volume fraction while Scl altered the final trabecular bone volume fraction at equilibrium. By careful calibration of biological parameters, we hope that this model can shed light on bone remodeling and associated diseased states. Micro-MPA models over several scales will be needed in the future because only with them it will be possible to unravel biological processes and their effects realistically. This will advance the field of bone remodeling and our current understanding of its mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157326-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d27aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) under project ID s1070.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the European Research Council (ERC Advanced MechAGE ERC-2016-ADG-741883).</p></sec></ack><sec id="S21" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="P48">The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P49"><bold>Author Contributions</bold></p><p id="P50">DB, FM, CL, JK, YDB, FS and RM contributed to the design of the study.
