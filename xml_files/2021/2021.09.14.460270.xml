The silica elements are formed intracellularly in a membrane-bound silica deposition vesicle (SDV), and are exocytosed after completion. How diatoms maintain membrane homeostasis during the exocytosis of these large and rigid silica elements is a long-standing enigma. We studied membrane dynamics during cell wall formation and exocytosis in two model diatom species, using live-cell confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. Our results show that during the formation of the mineral phase it is in tight association with the SDV membranes, which are forming a precise mold of the delicate geometrical patterns. During exocytosis, the distal SDV membrane and the plasma membrane gradually detach from the mineral and disintegrate in the extracellular space, without any noticeable endocytic retrieval or extracellular repurposing. Within the cell, there is no evidence for the formation of a new plasma membrane, thus the proximal SDV membrane becomes the new barrier between the cell and its environment, and assumes the role of a new plasma membrane. These results provide direct structural observations of diatom silica exocytosis, and point to an extraordinary mechanism in which membrane homeostasis is maintained by discarding, rather than recycling, significant membrane patches.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Science</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>Biomineralization</kwd><kwd>Diatoms</kwd><kwd>Exocytosis</kwd><kwd>Silica deposition vesicle</kwd><kwd>Membrane dynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diatoms are a diverse group of unicellular algae characterized by silica cell walls with intricate, species-specific shapes and hierarchical pore patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Despite immense morphological diversity between species, most diatom cell walls have a conserved layout of two similarly shaped silica ‘shells’ that partially overlap, like a petri-dish. Each ‘shell’ in itself consists of a valve and a series of girdle bands. The valves usually define the shape of the cell, are richly ornamented, and contain hierarchical pore patterns. The girdle bands form partially overlapping rings that surround the sidewalls of the cells.</p><p id="P3">Diatom cell wall formation is under biological control and linked to the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Each daughter cell inherits one half of the parental cell wall and forms a second valve directly after cell division. New girdle bands are formed and appended to the new valve during the growth of the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Silicification is usually an intracellular process, taking place inside a membrane-bound organelle, the silica deposition vesicle (SDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). SDVs are elongated, but very thin organelles, positioned directly under the plasma membrane. Inside the SDV, the chemical environment and biological regulation exert tight control over the silicification process, resulting in highly specific and reproducible cell wall architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). After intracellular maturation, the silica elements are exocytosed to cover the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Such exocytosis events are exceptional in cell biology since the content of the SDV is an enormous solid structure that needs to be secreted without damaging the integrity of the cell.</p><p id="P4">In classical exocytosis pathways, the membrane of an intracellular vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane to deliver its content into the extracellular space. Homeostasis of the plasma membrane can be maintained through a transient fusion that prevents the secreting vesicle from integrating with the plasma membrane, or by offsetting the added membrane through compensatory endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, due to their large size and rigidity, the secretion of diatom cell walls inflict a huge challenge to the organism. The new valve covers as much as half of the total cell surface and thus the surface area of the SDV membrane is similar to the entire plasma membrane, therefore, fusion with the SDV membrane would lead to an almost instantaneous doubling of the plasma membrane area.</p><p id="P5">While former studies have brought forward several hypotheses for silica cell wall exocytosis in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), significant experimental challenges have hindered further progress. On the one hand, traditional sample preparation for ultrastructural studies with electron microscopy causes artefacts like membrane shrinking and structure deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). On the other hand, the advantages of light microscopy in studying the dynamic aspects of cell wall formation in living cells are limited by the low spatial resolution and scarcity of molecular biology tools for diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Due to these limitations, in situ observations of the SDV in the cellular context are sparse, and direct evidence for the nature of the silicification and exocytosis process is missing.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we investigated membrane dynamics during valve formation and exocytosis in two model diatom species, <italic>Stephanopyxis turris</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>, using live-cell confocal fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET). The relatively large <italic>S. turris</italic> cells have easily discernible silica structures, allowing detailed observations of individual valves and the dynamic development of their architectural features using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). In addition, using cryo-ET we obtain high-resolution 3D data of the SDV in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, at native-like conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Our results indicate that valve exocytosis in both species involves disintegration of the distal membranes, accompanied by the repurposing of the proximal SDV membrane into a new plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">We investigated valve exocytosis in diatoms by studying two species, <italic>S. turris</italic> and <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The valves of <italic>S. turris</italic> are capsule-shaped and have a two-layered structure. The proximal layer is thin, perforated by nano-sized pores, and on the distal side overlain by a more elevated layer that forms large polygons. The top of the polygonal layer is flattened, forming a ‘T’-shape in cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>”). <italic>S. turris</italic> cells form chains that are linked through tubular linking extensions of silica that extend from the apex of the valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrow). <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> cells are shaped as a barrel and are much smaller, the valves are discs with a diameter of about 5 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Small pores perforate the silica layer that spans the area between radial ribs, and larger tubular pores, called fultoportulae, decorate the rim of the valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B</xref>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 E and F</xref> show dividing cells during and shortly after valve formation. Newly formed valves are stained by PDMPO, a fluorescent dye that is incorporated into silica during the process of biological mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Comparing the cell size to the size of mature valves shortly before exocytosis illustrates the enormous challenge involved in exocytosis of these rigid silica cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 G, H</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We studied membrane dynamics in <italic>S. turris</italic> using time-lapse confocal microscopy on living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Synchronized cultures were labelled with PDMPO to track silica formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), and with FM4-64 to stain the plasma membrane. FM4-64 is an amphiphilic, membrane-impermeable dye, that enters the cell only via endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). During silicification, the PDMPO and FM4-64 signals are almost indistinguishable, demonstrating the close proximity of the plasma membrane to the growing silica structures within the SDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This is exemplified during the formation of the polygons and the linking extensions, for which the fluorescent membrane signal by itself mirrors the process of silica growth. Nevertheless, the growing tips of linking extensions are exclusively stained by the membrane dye, indicating that SDV elongation precedes silicification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, arrow).</p><p id="P9">We recorded a time-lapse of the membrane dynamics in <italic>S. turris</italic> cells going through the entire process of valve formation and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). Silicification starts at the cell apex and advances radially. Progress of valve formation is visualized by the fluorescent plasma membrane outlining the growing polygonal silica layer and linking extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, t=0 to t=126). The onset of exocytosis, namely the loosening of the plasma membrane – SDV – silica complex is evident as the labelled plasma membrane no longer sharply outlines the polygons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, t=132). At the same time point, we observe an enhancement of the fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), likely due to fusion between the plasma and SDV membranes that exposes the SDV lumen to the surrounding media, from which free FM4-64 can infiltrate and stain the SDV membrane additionally to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the limited resolution of fluorescence microscopy does not allow to spatially resolve the interplay between SDV and plasma membranes before and after exocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The linking extensions of <italic>S. turris</italic> present a unique opportunity to investigate the exocytosis process as the old plasma membrane surrounds these long structures before exocytosis, but after exocytosis, the new plasma membrane is only at their base. The FM4-64 signal around the linking extensions is continuous during their growth, but after the extensions reached their full size the fluorescent signal changes to interrupted patches that gradually disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, t=156 and t=234). In some cases, the membranes surrounding a linking extension are clearly no longer connected to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B</xref>’). This labelling pattern, in which patches of stained membranes are disconnected from the cell, is very different from the expectation for a classical exocytosis process where stained membranes should be withdrawn and recycled inside the cell. It is important to note that FM4-64 is only transiently attached to the membranes and is present in the medium throughout the experiment. Therefore, it labels only structurally-intact membranes and when a membrane is disintegrated it will no longer label the malformed debris. Thus, these observations point to a scenario where major fractions of the distal membranes are completely detached from the main cell surface, gradually disintegrate, and lose their fluorescent labeling in the extracellular space between recently divided daughter cells.</p><p id="P11">To observe the same process at ultrastructural resolution we prepared dividing <italic>S. turris</italic> cells for TEM analysis. In short, synchronized cells were vitrified using high-pressure freezing and subsequently freeze-substituted and embedded in resin. This results in an optimal combination of near-to-native state preservation of subcellular structures paired with the ability of high-throughput TEM imaging at room temperature. The TEM images of <italic>S. turris</italic> cells prepared according to this procedure show exceptional preservation of the cellular environment and notably the SDV membranes and inorganic contents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We acquired hundreds of images from 227 cells at different stages of the cell cycle, and by categorizing and sorting these images, we reconstructed a timeline of valve formation and exocytosis in <italic>S. turris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Cells with an SDV containing a growing valve were classified as being at the stage of valve formation (n=61, examples presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A-B</xref>”). At these stages three lipid bilayers, the proximal and distal SDV membranes, as well as the plasma membrane, can be clearly distinguished. The distal SDV membrane is in very close proximity to the plasma membrane, with a distance of only 10-30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A</xref>” inset). During early valve formation, the SDV extends only as far as silica deposition has advanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A</xref>”). As silica precipitation proceeds radially, the SDV expands with it. After formation of the porous base layer, the polygonal layer is formed on its distal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 B-B</xref>”, arrow). During the entire silicification process, the SDV membrane tightly delineates the growing valve, forming a highly confined space in which the silica morphology is under control of the SDV membrane. The valve reaches its final morphology while it is still fully enclosed in the SDV, we observed 23 cells with an intact SDV containing a fully mature valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 C-C</xref>”).</p><p id="P13">In images of 68 cells, we observed a mature valve that is surrounded by SDV membranes with some discontinuities, i.e. the SDV does not form a complete enclosure. Based on this structural information we define these cells as undergoing exocytosis. These membrane discontinuities can be very local, while the majority of the valve is still tightly enclosed by the SDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 D-D</xref>”). At a later stage, the membrane ultrastructure changes dramatically. The tight delineation of the distal SDV and plasma membrane around the valve loosens, and we observe deterioration of the structural integrity of the distal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3. E-E</xref>”). The membrane at the proximal side of the valve is now continuous with the plasma membrane under the parental valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 E</xref>” arrow). At the end of the exocytosis process, the new valves can be recognized due to their position under the parental girdle bands, while no visible traces of the membranes are seen outside the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 F-F</xref>”).</p><p id="P14">We analyzed the microscopy data of the membrane proximal to the newly formed valves in order to identify possible signs of endocytic membrane retrieval that might be associated with recycling the SDV membranes. We observed 7 occasions of membrane invaginations in cells at the exocytosis stage. The size of these invaginations varies from 0.5 μm to 3 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). However, such invaginations were detected at all stages of valve formation and exocytosis with similar occurrence (X<sup>2</sup> <sub>(df=2, N=152)</sub> = 2.23, p =.327), and thus cannot be correlated to membrane recycling after exocytosis. Overall, the TEM data is in agreement with the live-cell imaging, suggesting that during valve exocytosis the distal membranes disintegrate extracellularly without signs of retrieval, while the only visible membrane proximal to the new valve is the proximal SDV membrane.</p><p id="P15">In order to visualize the cellular organization as close as possible to the native state, we acquired cryo-ET data from <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> cells undergoing valve exocytosis. The smaller size of these cells makes them suitable for the needed sample preparation steps for imaging with cryo-ET. In short, we vitrified synchronized <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> cells using plunge freezing, prepared thin lamellae using a focused ion beam and then collected electron tomograms under cryogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Out of the 59 pairs of daughter cells that were imaged, 15 were during or shortly after valve exocytosis, i.e. before exocytosis of the first set of girdle bands. Four of those were during the early stages of exocytosis, with the new valve only partly covered by SDV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4 A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P16"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A and C</xref> show tomograms of different locations of the same pair of slightly unsynchronized daughter cells, the left one shortly before exocytosis and the right one during exocytosis. The valve on the left side is still completely enclosed within the SDV, while the valve on the right side is already exposed to the extracellular space through discontinuities in the coverage by the distal membranes. In both cells, three lipid bilayers are discernible. In the daughter cell before exocytosis the expected arrangement of membranes is seen: the plasma membrane covers the whole cell and closely underneath the SDV membranes fully surround the valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A-B</xref>, left side). However, during exocytosis the distal membranes have fused at multiple sites, forming a network of flat membrane sacs, making the membrane on the proximal side of the valve the outermost boundary of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A-B</xref>, right side). A similar situation is observed at the valve periphery, where unconnected membranous structures are seen at the distal side of the fultoportula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 C-D</xref>, right side).</p><p id="P17">In eight pairs of cells that were at later stages of exocytosis we observed large membranous vesicles positioned between the recently exocytosed valves of two daughter cells and their girdle bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In the three remaining pairs of cells with recently exocytosed valves we did not observe any vesicles or membrane remnants between the two daughter cells. However, in those three cells the parental girdle bands were not enclosing the daughter cells, pointing to a later stage of the cell cycle, by which all extracellular debris had been degraded. Notably, none of the imaged cells contained budding endocytic vesicles or a sign for the formation of a new membrane underneath the valve. Therefore, the cryo-ET data suggest that <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> uses the same exocytosis mechanism that we inferred from <italic>S. turris</italic>, where the proximal SDV membrane is repurposed as a new plasma membrane and the distal membranes disintegrate extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Extrusion of the rigid cell walls of diatoms is an exceptional exocytosis event, difficult to reconcile with known exocytosis mechanisms. Our observations, of detached membrane patches in the extracellular space of two diatom species acquired with three microscopy techniques, are incompatible with classical exocytosis mechanisms. The structural characteristics of these unconnected and loose membranes after valve formation is in sharp contrast to the SDV ultrastructure during silica growth, which forms a highly confined space that is pivotal in controlling the shape of growing silica structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that exocytosis of mature valves occurs via a unique mechanism in which the old plasma membrane and distal SDV membrane are discarded in the extracellular space and the proximal SDV membrane takes the role of a new plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This scenario is in agreement with previous observations of rapid exchange of SDV proteins with the plasma membrane in live-cell studies of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P19">This scenario is also supported by the fact that none of the cells in our datasets show signs of processing or recycling of the SDV membranes, or the formation of a new plasma membrane under the valve. Nevertheless, we are aware that our live-cell imaging might not have the spatial resolution to detect such events, and that electron microscopy only gives information on random snapshots in time and space. For these reasons, we conducted a statistical analysis to determine the probability that exocytosis does involve the endocytic recycling of the SDV membrane. The tested scenario was that the ~1μm invaginations observed in <italic>S. turris</italic> are actually part of such endocytic retrieval process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). If this is the case, it will require the recycling of ~1300 such invaginations. We ran a statistical simulation, assuming a 10 seconds time window for an invagination to develop and be visible in an image, and a total 30 minutes for valve exocytosis. The simulation also addresses the probability to ‘catch’ this event in a random TEM thin slice (see supplementary material for simulation description). Running the simulation for 10,000 times showed that in more than 99.5% of the cases, the simulated scenario included the detection of more than 7 such events when 68 observations were made (corresponding to the 68 actual observations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, we can rule out the option of internalization of these membranes through compensatory endocytosis with a probability of p&lt;0.001, according to the permutation test.</p><p id="P20">The proposed scenario suggests that upon exocytosis the proximal SDV membrane becomes the new plasma membrane. As the SDV and plasma membranes carry out specialized, different tasks, it is likely that both require unique lipid and protein compositions, which would need to be adjusted after fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The finding that the distal membranes disintegrate extracellularly is surprising, as it seems wasteful to discard such a large amount of membranes each cell cycle. The low affinity of FM4-64 to degrading debris precludes the ability to follow the fate of these membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the girdle bands form a quasi-enclosed compartment around the newly formed valves, possibly slowing down diffusion away from the cell and facilitating the uptake of the membrane debris for cellular use after disintegration. This can conceivably minimize the energetic costs of such process.</p><p id="P21">The exocytosis of large content was also investigated in other organisms, demonstrating mechanisms that differ from the classical secretory pathway of numerous small vesicles that fuse with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). One alternative is the exocytosis of giant vesicles in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands that squeeze out their viscous cargo through a pore by crumpling of the vesicular membrane, followed by membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Another alternative, the acrosome reaction, surprisingly shares similarities with our proposal for diatom valve exocytosis. In this process, the plasma membrane and distal acrosomal membrane fuse at several locations forming vesicles that are dispersed in the environment while the proximal acrosomal membrane remains intact and becomes the new boundary that separates the spermatozoa from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To conclude, this work proposes a unique mechanism for the exocytosis of diatom silica, which involves two remarkable events. First, the repurposing of an organelle membrane into a plasma membrane and second, large-scale disintegration of membranes. This mechanism is shared by two model diatom species, indicating that this might be a general mechanism. With the toolbox for genetic research in diatoms growing, it will soon be possible to investigate the protein machinery that is involved in the regulation of this event, and its relation to classical exocytosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS144727-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S4"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anne Jantschke, Nathalie Pytlik, and Eike Brunner from TU Dresden for providing cultures.

During exocytosis, an intracellular vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents. In classical exocytosis, where the exocytosed vesicles are much smaller than the cell, membrane homeostasis is maintained by recycling excess membranes back into the cell. However, an extreme case of exocytosis is the extrusion of large and rigid cell wall elements by unicellular marine algae. During this process, the cell needs to deal with a potential doubling of its plasma membrane. This study reports on a unique exocytosis mechanism used by these organisms, in which the cells cope with the geometrical and physical challenges of exocytosis by releasing a significant amount of membranes to the extracellular space.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cell architecture of <italic>S. turris</italic> (A, C, E, G) and <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> (B, D, F, H).</title><p><bold>(A-B)</bold> SEM images.
