While most of the cells within the tumour have a high proliferative capacity, occasionally under stress conditions some cells will become arrested temporarily in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, in a reversible state often referred to as ‘quiescence’, ‘dormancy’, ‘diapause-like’, or a potentially irreversible state called ‘senescence’, where they maintain minimal basal activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). It has been proposed that G0 arrest enables cells to become resistant to anti-cancer compounds that target actively dividing cells, such as chemotherapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Moreover, a drug-tolerant ‘persister’ cell state represented by slow cycling, entirely quiescent or even senescent cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) has been observed in a variety of pre-existing or acquired resistance scenarios, also in the context of targeted therapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). As neoplastic cells evolve, G0 arrest can also be employed as a mechanism to facilitate immune evasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) or adaptation to new environmental niches during metastatic seeding(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In the context of disseminated tumour cells, these G0 cycle arrest states can facilitate minimal residual disease, a major cause of relapse in the clinic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Although G0 arrest is a widely conserved cellular state, essential for the normal development and homeostasis of eukaryotes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and has been extensively studied in a variety of organisms including bacteria and yeast(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), its role and different facets in cancer are still poorly defined. Hampering our understanding is the fact that it represents a number of heterogeneous states(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Canonically, cells can be forced into G0 arrest through serum starvation, mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Cells can also undergo G0 arrest spontaneously in response to cell-intrinsic factors like replication stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This process is controlled by p53(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), which triggers the inhibition of cyclin-CDK complexes by activating p21(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). This in turn allows the assembly of the DREAM complex - a key effector responsible for repression of cell-cycle dependent gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Min and Spencer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) recently demonstrated a much broader systemic coordination of 198 genes underlying distinct types of G0 arrest by profiling the transcriptomes of cells that entered this state either spontaneously or upon different stimuli. Additionally, proliferation-G0 decisions can be impacted by oncogenic changes such as <italic>MYC</italic> amplification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) or altered p38/ERK signalling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Despite these advances, the identification of G0-arrested cells within tumours presents an ongoing challenge due to their scarcity and lack of universal, easily measurable markers for the activation and maintenance of this state. As they are often defined by a lack of proliferative markers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), different forms of G0 arrest such as quiescence, senescence, dormancy and (to a lesser extent) stemness, might sometimes be used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Quiescent and dormant cells can readily resume their proliferative state, senescent cells are irreversibly arrested(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) while cancer stem cells have a high capacity for self-renewal and sit at the top of the differentiation hierarchy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Even though the same cell cycle arrest programme underlies all of these states, they are linked with distinct environmental stimuli, and drive cancer progression and therapeutic resistance in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Increasing evidence from the literature points towards the rapid adaptation of tumour cells to drug treatments being enabled by a slow dividing or a quiescent state that persists for a short period of time before the cells start reproliferating(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Thus, quiescence could more frequently be encountered at the early stages of therapeutic resistance compared to other cell cycle arrest phenotypes, although senescence and stemness are also often discussed in this context. Biomarkers of cell cycle arrest and persistence that are sufficiently specific and robust to be clinically useful are clearly needed.</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, our understanding of how cancer evolution is shaped by proliferation and G0 arrest decisions is limited. The proliferative heterogeneity of cancer cell populations has been previously described and linked with FAK/AKT1 signalling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), but the constraints and consequences of these cell state switches have not been systematically profiled across cancer tissues. The extent to which G0 arrest in cancer is enacted through transcriptional or genetic control is unknown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), and neither are the mutational processes and genomic events modulating this state. Understanding the evolutionary triggers and molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to enter and maintain G0 arrest would enable us to develop pharmacological strategies to selectively eradicate these arrested cancer cells or prevent them from re-entering proliferative cycles.</p><p id="P6">To address these challenges, we have developed a new method to reliably quantify G0 arrest in cancer using transcriptomic data, and employed it to characterise this phenomenon in bulk and single cell datasets from a variety of solid tumours. We describe the spectrum of proliferation and G0 arrest decisions in primary tumours, which reflects a range of stress adaptation mechanisms during the course of cancer development from early to advanced disease. We identify and validate mutational constraints for the emergence of G0 arrest, hinting at potential new therapeutic targets that could exploit this mechanism. We also demonstrate the relevance of G0 arrest to responses to a range of compounds targeting cell cycle, kinase signalling and epigenetic mechanisms in single cell datasets, and propose an expression signature that could be employed to detect treatment resistance induced by G0 arrested tumour cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Evaluating G0 arrest in cancer from transcriptomic data</title><p id="P7">We hypothesised that primary tumours contain varying numbers of cells temporarily or permanently arrested in the cell cycle, which reflect evolutionary adaptations to cellular stress and may determine their ability to overcome antiproliferative therapies. To capture this elusive phenotype, we developed a computational framework that would allow us to quantify G0 arrest signals in bulk and single cell sequenced cancer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). To define a signature of G0 arrest, we focused on genes that have been shown by Min and Spencer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) to be specifically activated or inactivated during quiescence that arises spontaneously or as a response to serum starvation, contact inhibition, MEK inhibition or CDK4/6 inhibition. The activity of 139 of these genes changed in a coordinated manner across all these five distinct forms of quiescence, likely representing generic transcriptional consequences of G0 arrest. The expression levels of these markers were used to derive a score reflecting the relative abundance of G0 arrested cells within individual tumours (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To validate this signature and select the optimal method to score G0 arrest in individual samples amongst different enrichment/rank-based scoring methodologies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), we used seven single-cell and bulk datasets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) where actively proliferating and quiescent/dormant cells had been independently isolated and sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, Methods). We tested the performance of our signature and scoring methodology, as well as that of other commonly used gene signatures, in distinguishing between the truly quiescent/dormant and truly proliferating cells in these seven datasets while varying the expression cut-offs for labelling cells as G0 arrested or proliferating based on the respective signature. A combined Z-score approach had the highest accuracy in detecting signals of G0 arrest, with a 91% mean performance in classifying cells as G0 arrested or cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a-b</xref>). Indeed, the individual cells that had been identified as arrested in G0 in the experiments showed a significantly higher Z-score than the dividing cells across all datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). Our signature reflected an expected increase in p27 protein levels, which are elevated in during G0 arrest(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>). It also outperformed classical cell cycle and arrest markers, such as the expression of targets of the DREAM complex, CDK2, Ki67 and of mini-chromosome replication maintenance (MCM) protein complex genes - which are involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication, as well as recently defined G1/S and G2/M signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Importantly, our approach provided a good separation between G0 and proliferating samples across a variety of cancer types and models including cancer cell lines, 3D organoid cultures, circulating tumour cells and patient-derived xenografts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), thereby demonstrating its broad applicability. Furthermore, the strength of the score appeared to reflect the duration of G0 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We further experimentally validated our methodology in nine lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. We estimated the fraction of G0 cells in each of these cell lines using quantitative, single-cell imaging of phospho-Ser807/811-Rb (phospho-Rb, which labels proliferative cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>)) and 24 hour EdU proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-h</xref>). In these assays, cells were pulse-labelled with the nucleotide analogue, EdU, for 24h before fixation and immunostaining. Only cells which have proliferated in the last 24h will be labelled by EdU. EdU negative cells are classed as G0. Cells that were negative for phospho-Rb were also defined as G0, and not G1, since they have not yet passed the restriction point (phospho-Rb negative; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-f</xref>). This G0 fraction was further validated in A549 and NCI-H1944 cells where endogenous PCNA has been labelled with an mRuby fluorophore to enable tracking of cell cycle phase lengths by live-cell imaging (Zerjatke et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), Methods). By quantifying the G0/G1 length in individual cells (i.e. time taken to enter S-phase after mitotic exit) over a 48h period, we could see that these cells were quiescent and not senescent (or in deep quiescence), as all G0/G1 cells did eventually enter S-phase, albeit with variable timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">There was a remarkably good correlation between our predicted G0 arrest levels based on the expression of these cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the fraction of G0 cells in the experiment as assessed by lack of EdU incorporation over a 24h period (EdU incorporation only occurs during S phase) but particularly by lack of Rb phosphorylation. Phosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein is often used to define the boundary between G0 and G1, and was specifically shown to distinguish the G0 state recently by Stallaert et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Furthermore, a G1 signature (Methods) was not associated with these experimental measurements, suggesting our method recovers a state more similar to G0 arrest rather than a prolonged G1 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref>). The G0 arrest correlations appeared robust to random removal of individual genes from the signature, with no single gene having an inordinate impact on the score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1f-h</xref>). This provided further reassurance that our Z-score based methodology is successful in capturing G0 arrest signals from bulk tumour data.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The spectrum of G0 arrest capacity in solid primary tumours</title><p id="P12">Having established a robust framework for quantifying G0 cell cycle arrest in cancer, we next profiled 8,005 primary tumour samples across 31 solid cancer tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After accounting for potential confounding signals of non-cycling non-tumour cells from the microenvironment by correcting for tumour purity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1i-j</xref>), we observed an entire spectrum of fast proliferating to slowly cycling tumours, with the latter presenting stronger G0-linked signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). While we acknowledge that no tumour would be entirely quiescent/senescent and we cannot identify individual G0 arrested cells within the tumour, this analysis does capture a broad range of phenotypes reflecting varying proliferation and cell cycle arrest rates, which suggests that G0 arrest is employed to different extents by tumours as an adaptive mechanism to various extrinsic and intrinsic stress factors. Cancers known to be frequently dormant, such as glioblastoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), were amongst the highest ranked in terms of G0 arrest levels, along with kidney and adrenocortical carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). This is likely explained by the innate proliferative capacity of the respective tissues. Indeed, tissues with lower stem cell division rates presented a greater propensity for G0 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Our score showed strong negative correlations with the expression of proliferation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), suggesting that it captures a cellular state that could potentially act as a baseline for all major forms of cell cycle arrest, including quiescence, senescence, stemness and clinical dormancy. Indeed, we found that our signature could to a certain extent also separate senescent cells from proliferating ones in single cell data from Hernandez-Segura et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), which is unsurprising since these cells are also in the G0 phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). Indeed, the authors of this resource highlight that some of the pathways uncovered in these senescent cells may be shared with quiescence, which is also backed up by a study from Fujimaki and Yao(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) suggesting similarities between deep quiescence and senescence. Our score did not show strong correlations with other markers of senescence such as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and β-galactosidase activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) in single cells or TCGA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2b-d</xref>), although we cannot exclude the possibility of a senescent state being captured occasionally given that neither β-galactosidase nor the SASP are obligatory for maintaining senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). However, the underpinning programme appears to be distinct from that of cancer stem cells, marked by signatures associated with high telomerase activity and an undifferentiated state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Lastly, we confirmed expected dependencies on the p53/p21/DREAM activation axis: tumours that were proficient in <italic>TP53</italic> or the components of the DREAM complex, as well as those with higher p21 expression, had elevated G0 arrest levels across numerous tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2g-h</xref>), although only 8 out of 139 genes in our signature are directly transcriptionally regulated by p53(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Nevertheless, p53 proficiency appears to be a non-obligatory dependency of G0 arrest, which is also observed to arise in p53 mutant scenarios in 21% of cases. p53 has also been shown to play a role in preventing the occurrence of larger structural events and polyploidy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), potentially explaining the lower G0 arrest levels we observed in tumours that had undergone whole genome duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The genomic background of G0 arrest in cancer</title><p id="P15">Cancer evolution is often driven by a variety of genomic events, ranging from single base substitutions to larger scale copy number variation and rearrangements of genomic segments. It is reasonable to expect that certain mutations accumulated by the cancer cells might enable a more proliferative phenotype, impairing the ability of cells to enter G0 arrest, or – on the contrary – might favour cell cycle exit as a temporary adaptive mechanism to extreme levels of stress. Having obtained G0 arrest estimates for primary tumour samples, we set out to identify potential genomic triggers or constraints that may shape proliferation versus G0 arrest decisions in cancer. We identified 285 cancer driver genes that were preferentially altered (via mutations or copy number alterations) either in slow cycling or fast proliferating tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Reassuringly, this list included genes previously implicated in driving cell cycle exit decisions such as <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We also investigated associations with mutagenic footprints of carcinogens (termed “mutational signatures”), which can be identified as trinucleotide substitution patterns in the genome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). 15 mutational signatures were linked with G0 arrest levels either within individual cancer studies or pan-cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2i</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Following the initial prioritisation of putative genomic constraints of G0 arrest, we employed machine learning to identify those events that could best distinguish slow cycling tumours with higher abundance of G0 arrested cells from fast proliferating ones, while accounting for tissue effects. An ensemble elastic net selection approach similar to the one described by Pich et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) was applied for this purpose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Our pan-cancer model identified tissue type to be a major determinant of G0 arrest levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). It also uncovered a reduced set of 57 genomic events linked with proliferation/G0 arrest switches, including SNVs and copy number losses in 17 cancer genes, as well as amplifications of 10 cancer genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). These events could then be successfully employed to predict G0 arrest in a separate test dataset, thus internally validating our model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>). Thus, while these events are not necessarily causative, the link is strong enough to be identifying G0 arrest states from genomic data alone. Such events may also pinpoint cellular vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.</p><p id="P17">Overall, the genomic dependencies of G0 arrest mainly comprised genes involved in cell cycle pathways, p53 regulation and ubiquitination (most likely of cell cycle targets), and RUNX3 regulation, which have previously been shown to play a role in controlling proliferation and cell cycle entry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>).

To explore this, we re-scored tumours based on gene expression programmes specific to serum starvation, contact inhibition, MEK inhibition, CDK4/6 inhibition or spontaneously occurring quiescence as defined by Min and Spencer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).

Spontaneous quiescence and serum starvation scores were most correlated with the activity of p21, or of genes involved in the cellular response to starvation, respectively. The contact inhibition programme was also captured, but with lesser specificity.</p><p id="P27">CDK4/6 inhibition-induced G0 arrest levels were further validated using external RNA-seq datasets from cancer cell lines and xenograft mice sequenced before and after treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The fact that the estimates for a generic G0 arrest phenotype were equally or, in some cases, more discriminative of cells treated with Palbociclib confirms the generalisability of this score, which may be more broadly applicable to different tissues and/or model systems, as shown previously in the single cell validation data. The CDK4/6 inhibition scores outperformed all the other stress response subtype scores, suggesting that a combination of individual programmes and the generic score might best identify a specific stimulus driving G0 arrest. Interestingly, we also observed significant differences in spontaneous quiescence scores before and after treatment. Indeed, p21 activity has been linked with the Palbociclib mechanism of action(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>), and this analysis suggests potential similarities between CDK4/6 inhibition and p21-dependent G0 arrest phenotypes.</p><p id="P28">Having validated our framework for quantifying stimulus-specific G0 arrest programmes, we proceeded to estimate the dominant form of stress that may induce cell cycle arrest in different cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref>). We found a range of G0 arrest aetiologies across most tissues, while a minority of cancers were dominated by a single form of stress response, e.g. serum starvation in all G0 arrested pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, contact inhibition in 88% of head and neck carcinomas and CDK4/6 inhibition in 80% of adrenocortical carcinomas. While we do not wish to claim that the state of cell cycle arrest will have necessarily been induced by the actual predicted stimulus (impossible in the case of CDK4/6 or MEK inhibition, as the analysed samples are all treatment-naïve), we suggest that the downstream signalling cascade may resemble that triggered by such stimuli, e.g. via CDK4/6 or MEK loss of function mutations.</p><p id="P29">Some of the differences observed might be explained by the dependency between p53 activity and the form of stress response that is enacted. Amongst the five different forms, spontaneous G0 arrest appeared most strongly dependent on p53 functionality, with a nearly two-fold enrichment of p53 proficient tumours in this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6f</xref>). Indeed, significantly higher levels of spontaneous G0 arrest were observed in the majority of cancers (56%) when p53 was functional rather than mutated. The second most dependent state was that of CDK4/6 inhibition, with increased levels in 36% of cancer types displaying p53 proficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6g</xref>). Overall, these analyses of stress response states point to common transcriptional features of drug-tolerant G0 arrested cells in different cancer settings that could be employed in designing ways to eradicate these cells in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Role of G0 arrest in driving therapeutic resistance in cancer uncovered from single cell data</title><p id="P30">Overall, G0 arrest appears to be beneficial for the long-term outcome of cancer patients, even when accounting for potential confounders such as stage, sex and tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>). No clear relation was observed between G0 arrest levels within the primary tumour and risk of relapse, although higher G0 arrest was occasionally deemed favourable to avoiding disease recurrence or progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7b-e</xref>). Indeed, such slow cycling, indolent tumours would have higher chances of being eradicated earlier in the disease, which is consistent with reported worse prognosis of patients with higher tumour cell proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>). As expected, G0 arrest levels were increased in stage 1 tumours, although later stages also exhibited this phenotype occasionally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7f</xref>). However, outcomes do vary depending on the stress source, with worse survival observed upon contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). The outcomes also vary by tissue: when the cut-offs between increased G0 arrest and high proliferation were defined on an individual cancer basis rather than pan-cancer, we found that lung, colon or esophageal carcinoma patients displayed significantly worse prognosis in the context of high proportions of G0 arrested cells in the tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Indeed, p53 wild type colorectal cancers expressing a quiescence-linked fetal phenotype have been recently associated with metastasis and poor prognosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>). In contrast, adrenocortical and kidney papillary cell carcinoma ranked in the top of cancers with improved survival. It is noticeable that the cancers in the former, worse prognosis group are also amongst the ones displaying lower than average G0 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), so the observed inferior outcomes could in part be linked to these cancers being intrinsically faster progressing. It is possible there is a lower limit below which G0 arrest stops being useful for delaying growth and becomes detrimental instead, perhaps in conjunction with treatment. Indeed, other factors such as the type of therapy received could play a role too. While we are limited in the investigation of such factors in TCGA due to the incomplete records available, these discrepancies should be subject to future research.</p><p id="P31">While G0 arrest may confer an overall survival advantage in most cancers, it can also provide a pool of cells that are capable of developing resistance to therapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>). Using our methodology, we indeed observed an increase in G0 arrest levels in cell lines following treatment with EGFR, BRAF and CDK4/6 inhibitors, as well as conventionally used chemotherapies such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in multiple bulk RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Furthermore, the recent widespread availability of single-cell transcriptomics offers the opportunity to investigate the impact of G0 arrest on such therapies with much greater granularity than is allowed by bulk data. Using our G0 arrest signature and single-cell data from RKO and SW480 colon cancer cell lines treated with 5-FU(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>), we could observe G0 arrest and proliferation decisions following conventional chemotherapy treatment. Within the p53 proficient cell line RKO, the fraction of G0 arrested cells increased from 41% to 93% after treatment with a low dose (10 μM) of 5-FU and persisted at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e-f</xref>). In contrast, a comparable increase in G0 arrest was not observed in <italic>TP53</italic> mutant SW480 cells, further emphasizing the key role of p53 as a regulator of cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g-h</xref>). This implies that although <italic>TP53</italic> mutations confer a more aggressive tumour phenotype and may drive resistance via other mechanisms, <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type tumour cells are more likely to be capable of entering a G0 “persistent” state associated with drug resistance. SW480 cells showed higher apoptotic activity following treatment compared to RKO cells, particularly within actively cycling cells, further corroborating that cells capable of entering G0 arrest may be intrinsically less vulnerable to this therapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 8a-b</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Similarly, using single cell data from an <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell line treated with the EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>), we predicted that 40% of cells were likely to exist in a G0 arrest state prior to treatment. EGFR inhibition led to a massive decrease in cell numbers immediately after treatment, mostly due to proliferating cells dying off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 8c-d</xref>), while the proportion of arrested cells increased to 96% at day 1, indicating an immediate selective advantage for such cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6i-j</xref>). These cells appear to gradually start proliferating again in the following days during continuous treatment, with the percentage of proliferating cells approaching pre-treatment levels by day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6j</xref>). The same trend captured by our signature could be observed upon KRAS and BRAF inhibition in different cell line models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8e-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>). Furthermore, during the first days of treatment the NSCLC cells that survived EGFR inhibition appeared to reside in a state most resembling that induced by serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6k-l</xref>). Both EGFR kinase inhibitors and serum starvation have been shown to trigger autophagy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>), which may explain the convergence between this inhibitory trigger and the type of stress response. At day 11 most of the remaining arrested cells appeared in a state similar to that preceding the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6l</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Thus, G0 arrest appears to explain resistance to broad acting chemotherapy agents as well as targeted molecular inhibitors of the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway, being either selected for, or induced immediately upon treatment, and gradually waning over time as cells start re-entering the cell cycle.

Although the studies available for inspection are rather sparse, evidence from all the analyses presented here suggests there is no universal a priori role that G0 arrest has within the pre-treated primary tumour in determining response to treatment, with more favourable overall outcomes observed occasionally due to slower progressing malignancy, but also resistance observed in the case of chemotherapy in breast cancer. Instead, the role of G0 arrest in enabling therapeutic resistance as a short-lived acquired phenotype as demonstrated in single cell datasets appears more consistent.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Tumour cell G0 arrest signature for use in single-cell transcriptomics data</title><p id="P36">Our ability to probe the nature of G0 arrest phenotypes in single cell RNA-seq data using a defined G0 signature could aid the development of methods to selectively target G0 arrested drug-resistant persister cells.

The single cell RNA-seq datasets we analysed exhibited an average drop-out of 8.5 genes out of the full gene signature. While our scoring method remains robust to such levels of dropout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1d-f</xref>), we also employed machine learning to reduce our initial list of 139 markers of quiescence to a robust 35-gene signature, comprised mainly of RNA metabolism and splicing-regulating factors, but also of genes involved in cell cycle progression, ageing and senescence, which could be applied to sparser datasets with larger levels of gene dropout (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

The lack of proliferative markers such as Ki67 or CDK2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref>) does not uniquely distinguish G0 arrest from other cell cycle phases, e.g. G1. Miller et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) have shown that the Ki67 is expressed at the mRNA level but the protein is degraded continuously both in G0 and G1, and it rather acts as a graded marker of S/G2/M. Similarly, CDK2 activity is low in G0, G1, builds up at the restriction point, is high in the S phase and is then replaced by CDK1 in mitosis. Reduced CDK2 expression can manifest due to quiescence, mitosis, but also to DNA damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref>), and thus cut-offs to uniquely distinguish its activity in G0 would be difficult to define. Furthermore, these and other reliable markers of G0 arrest such as p27 or p130(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) are best captured at protein level, which is much more sparsely measured, and expression does not accurately reflect their activity. This study overcame this limitation by employing genes active in different forms of quiescence whose patterns of expression are distinct from markers of a longer G1 phase, and capture cell cycle arrest as also observed in senescence, stemness or dormancy. We have extensively validated our method and signature in single cell datasets and cancer cell lines, and have demonstrated that it can reliably and robustly capture signals of G0 arrest both in bulk tissue as well as in single cells.</p><p id="P38">Within bulk tissue, we are limited in our capacity to distinguish between large fractions of cells residing in short-lived G0 arrest and a smaller fraction of cells that are in deeper G0 arrest, as our score seems to reflect both parameters to a certain extent. Bearing in mind this limitation, our score could potentially also be used in a single cell setting to capture longer-lived cell cycle arrest states such as ones demonstrated in senescence or dormancy, and could assist in identifying such states, but only with the help of additional cell-state specific, immune or secretory biomarkers. Indeed, gene activity linked to cell cycle arrest is not exclusive to quiescence, but can be shared with senescence or dormancy in certain scenarios, as also demonstrated in some of our analyses of senescent cells. This makes it difficult to clearly distinguish states like dormancy, senescence, quiescence (particulary deep quiescence), as even their definitions can be contentious at times both in the context of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref>) as well as in physiological conditions in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>). Since our signature was derived and validated in experiments that were tailored specifically to induce and/or measure quiescence, we believe the signature proposed in this study best reflects a quiescent-like, reversible G0 cell cycle arrest state. While senescent and dormant cells could be distinguished from their quiescent counterparts simply based on additional senescence and dormancy markers, further research is nevertheless required in the future to delineate signatures that are both necessary and sufficient to unambiguously discriminate all three states. In the meantime, future studies utilising our G0 signature should also test for such additional markers like β-galactosidase activity, the SASP and other senescence markers, or <italic>NRF2, NR2F1, SOX9</italic>, RARβ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref>) and other dormancy markers to ascertain the type of G0 arrest that is being captured.</p><p id="P39">The versatility of our signature is evidenced by high classification accuracies across a variety of solid cancer datasets. More variable performance was observed when applied to hematopoietic stem cells as it was not designed to capture signals in this context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). While we cannot exclude that the patterns captured may also occasionally reflect cell cycle arrest in G1 or G2, this broad signature would still capture phenotypes resulting from intrinsic or extrinsic cellular stress that reflect temporary tumour adaptation during the course of cancer evolution or upon treatment with drugs. Thus, studying such states is relevant for identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited at different time points during the course of cancer treatment.</p><p id="P40">We show that G0 arrest is pervasive across different solid cancers and generally associated with more stable, less mutated genomes with intact DNA damage repair pathways. We also find a link between APOBEC mutagenesis and higher levels of G0 arrest. Some neoplastic events enriched in tumours with increased G0 arrest, such as p16 or <italic>ZMYM2</italic> deletions, could mark elevated genomic stress that renders cells more prone to cell cycle exit. We also identified mutational events affecting a variety of genes such as <italic>PTEN, CEP89, CYLD, LMNA</italic> that appear unfavourable to cell cycle arrest, thus potentially implicating them in influencing G0 arrest-proliferation decisions.

A recent paper describes how increased CEP89 copy number and expression correlates with a worse prognosis in ovarian cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref>), which we hypothesise could be linked to Cep89’s role in modulating G0 arrest. Although we do not yet know how Cep89 regulates G0 arrest, two roles have been ascribed to Cep89 which could be significant. First, Cep89 is required for primary cilium assembly(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">116</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">117</xref>). The primary cilium acts as a signalling hub, transducing extracellular signals to intracellular signalling networks, many of which regulate growth and proliferation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref>). Cep89 deficiency also leads to defects in Complex IV assembly in the electron transport chain in mitochondria, leading to decreased mitochondrial function and ATP production(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref>). Decreased ATP would impair the ability of cells to proliferate. Since Cep89 is a coiled-coil protein with no obviously targetable regulatory domains, it will be important to ascertain which Cep89 function is key to regulating the balance between proliferation and arrest in cancer cells to be able to potentially target that process, rather than Cep89 itself, to induce or maintain G0 arrest.</p><p id="P41">These large-scale genomic associations with G0 arrest phenotypes are only currently feasible in bulk datasets. However, bulk sequenced data has a major limitation in capturing an average signal across all cells within the tumour, which prevents individual cell state identification and counting. Our subsequent exploration of single cell datasets across 193 therapeutic scenarios complements this analysis and illustrates the power of applying our signature in single cells.</p><p id="P42">Our signature of G0 arrest is prognostic and marks primary tumours with a lower proliferative capacity before treatment, but we also clearly demonstrate that it can be employed to track resistance to multiple cell cycle, kinase signalling and epigenetic targeting regimens, where it often appears as a short-lived phenotype. While this discrepancy may appear incompatible at first glance, it is not unlike other cellular processes that have been shown to present dual roles in a cancer setting, such as reactive oxygen species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref>), but also p38α(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121">121</xref>) or NRF2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R122">122</xref>), both of which have been implicated in quiescence or dormancy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">123</xref>). It is possible that there is a tipping point between G0 arrest acting beneficially or detrimentally during tumour development and treatment. Furthermore, this is likely influenced by a myriad of other complex factors that we have not had the chance to analyse in depth here, and in some cases it may just be the baseline for acquiring cancer cell stemness or senescent properties. While we acknowledge this conundrum requires further study, we believe this phenotype also offers a unique opportunity to further understand mechanisms of tumour resistance. A key open question remains: if G0 arrest drives resistance, does it do so in a Darwinian fashion, as a pre-existing population that is selected for upon drug treatment, or is it instead an acquired phenotype? Our single cell analyses cannot exclude either scenario. Given the variable links to treatment response and lack of clear evidence for relapse when surveying G0 arrest in primary tumours <italic>before</italic> treatment, it is likely our G0 arrest signature in its current form cannot be used to predict resistance to chemotherapy or targeted therapy, and we would not recommend it for this purpose unless further validated in a specific cancer setting. We have also not inspected the role of G0 arrest in the context of immunotherapy, which remains an area of future study. However, we believe our signature has high value for the study of emerging resistance in an <italic>in vitro/in vivo</italic> setting, as a short-lived enabler of drug tolerance. The optimised signature we propose for single cell data makes it tractable to a variety of future studies in this area.</p><p id="P43">In a treatment setting, vulnerabilities of G0 arrested cells could be exploited for combination therapies. Cells which have exited the cell cycle utilise several mechanisms to achieve drug resistance, including upregulation of stress-induced pathways such as anti-apoptotic BCL-2 signalling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">124</xref>), anti-ROS programmes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) or immune evasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Further studies are needed to elucidate which of these mechanisms are specifically employed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p id="P44">Our findings contribute to the understanding of the aetiology and genetic context of G0 arrest in cancer. This is particularly relevant to identifying new anti-proliferative targets, but also for the detection and eradication of drug tolerant persister cells, which have been frequently, although not always, observed to be slow cycling or entirely quiescent/senescent(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Importantly, the state of G0 arrest that we have studied here is distinct from that of disseminated tumour cells causing clinical dormancy and cancer relapse, often after many years from the treatment of the primary tumour(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref>). Here, we have focused on understanding how tumours make proliferation and G0 arrest decisions during the earlier stages of cancer development, within the treatment-naïve primary tumour and as an immediate response to anti-cancer therapies. However, since the dormancy of disseminated tumour cells is fundamentally enabled through a long but temporary cell cycle arrest, we believe our findings of the fundamental processes linked with G0 arrest could in the future help inform a better characterisation of dormant tumour cells when combined with specific microenvironmental signatures that are critical for enabling that process.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P45">Overall, our study provides, for the first time, a pan-cancer view of G0 arrest and its evolutionary constraints, underlying novel mutational dependencies which could be exploited in the clinic. We propose a G0 arrest signature which can be robustly measured in bulk tissue or single cells and could potentially inform therapeutic strategies in the longer term. This signature could be assessed in the clinic to track rapidly emerging resistance, e.g. through liquid biopsies or targeted gene panels. We hope these insights can be used as building blocks for future studies into the different regulators of G0 arrest, including epigenetics and microenvironmental interactions, as well as the mechanisms by which it enables therapeutic resistance both in solid and haematological malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Selection of G0 arrest marker genes</title><sec id="S14"><title>Generic G0 arrest markers</title><p id="P46">Differential expression analysis results comparing cycling immortalised, non-transformed human epithelial cells and cells in five different forms of quiescence (spontaneous quiescence, contact inhibition, serum starvation, CDK4/6 inhibition and MEK inhibition) were obtained from Min and Spencer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

We opted for a conservative approach and classed each sample with a high level of G0 arrest into a specific stress response subtype if the arrest score for the corresponding programme was higher than one standard deviation of the distribution across the TCGA cohort, and if the score was significantly higher than for the remaining programmes when assessed using a Student’s t test.

A random forest model was trained on each dataset separately to predict the state (G0 arrest/cycling) of a given cell based on the expression levels of the 139 genes in the signature. The Gini indices corresponding to each gene in the model were normalised to a range of values between 0 and 1, which would reflect how important an individual gene was for determining G0 arrest state relative to the other 138 genes. The procedure was repeated 1000 times for each of the three datasets, and the average Gini coefficients across iterations were stored.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p id="P89">Prioritisation of gene subsets based on cumulative importance in the model</p><p id="P90">Genes were placed in the candidate subset if their importance metric was above a given threshold in at least one of the datasets.

For this, a separate validation dataset was utilized, which contained gene expression levels for the 139 genes in the 10 lung cancer cell lines previously employed for experimental validation, along with the quiescence state of the lines as inferred by phospho-Rb and EdU staining. For each gene subset, a combined z-score of G0 arrest was calculated from the expression levels as described previously. The correlations between this z-score and the two experimental measurements of quiescence were used to establish the ability of a gene combination to predict quiescence. Among the top performing subsets, a 35 gene signature with a mean correlation of 78% between predicted and measured G0 arrest levels in the test data (p=0.016) showed the highest correlation with phospho-Rb measurements capturing short-lived G0 arrest, the more common state observed in single cell treatment datasets. Therefore, this signature was deemed to achieve the best trade-off between gene numbers and signal capture.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P93">The optimised gene signature is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P94">Groups were compared using a two-sided Student’s t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test or ANOVA, as appropriate.
