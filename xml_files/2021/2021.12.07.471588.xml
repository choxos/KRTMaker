<abstract>
<p id="P1">Early treatment of patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting mild symptoms can reduce the number that progress to more severe disease and require hospitalization. Considering the potential for the development of drug resistance to existing therapies and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, there is a need for an expanded armamentarium of treatment options for COVID-19. Epeleuton is a novel orally administered second-generation n-3 fatty acid with potential direct antiviral and immunomodulatory actions, and a favourable clinical safety profile. In this study we show that epeleuton inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral load, replication and disease pathology in the lungs and upper airways in the Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support the potential utility of epeleuton in the early treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of epeleuton as an outpatient treatment and prevention of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and follows SARS-CoV and MERS as the third highly pathogenic coronavirus in the last twenty years<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. COVID-19 can range in severity from a mild respiratory illness to severe disease progressing to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">As of early December 2021, there have been more than 262 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally and more than 5.2 million deaths reported to WHO. More than 7.8 billion vaccine doses have been administered. Indeed, the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has substantially mitigated COVID-19 outbreaks and aided in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination has been effective in reducing the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations and deaths<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. However, uncertainties remain regarding the longevity of protection conferred by vaccination, and global disparities remain in the access and adoption of vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. These factors contribute to a complex and varied epidemiology at both a global and regional level.</p>
<p id="P4">Within this evolving context, early treatment of patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting mild symptoms can reduce the number of patients that progress to more severe disease and require hospitalization or admission to intensive care units. However, there is a paucity of therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment in an outpatient setting and there is an urgent need for new therapeutics. Emergency use authorisations of effective therapeutics such as REGN-COV2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> and the emergence of molnupiravir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> and Paxlovid<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> are important milestones but the need for an expanded armamentarium of therapeutic options and modalities is especially evident considering the potential for development of drug resistance to existing therapies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> and the anticipated disparities in access to newly approved treatments.</p>
<p id="P5">Epeleuton is 15-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid 15(S)-HEPE) ethyl ester, a second-generation synthetic n-3 fatty acid derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). It is rapidly de-esterified to its active form, 15(S)-HEPE following oral administration. 15(S)-HEPE, at much lower concentrations, is an endogenous downstream 15-lipoxygenase metabolite of EPA. Epeleuton is associated with cardiometabolic and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical and preclinical studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The therapeutic effects of 15(S)-HEPE are thought to be induced by pleiotropic modes of action. As of mid-October 2021, epeleuton has completed an extensive toxicological evaluation and been administered to more than 300 subjects in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, with a favourable safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo. Epeleuton is in phase 2b clinical development as a treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction (NCT04365400).</p>
<p id="P6">There is accumulating evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acids have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-viral properties, which may confer beneficial effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Lipids play important roles in viral entry and replication, interacting with viruses throughout their life cycle. Consequently, exogenous lipid mediators may regulate the host immune response to viral infection.</p>
<p id="P7">Several potential binding targets for fatty acids have been identified including targets for fatty acid binding on the spike protein (S) and envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. A recent study found that the S protein binds the free fatty acid linoleic acid (LA). LA binding stabilized a locked S conformation, resulting in reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. A similar binding pocket was also present in the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Building on this discovery it was reported that LA and EPA, the metabolic precursor of epeleuton’s active moiety 15(S)-HEPE can interfere with binding to ACE2 and significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">We postulated that due to the potential of epeleuton to impact both the host immune response and to directly decrease pathogen burden by acting directly against SARS-CoV-2, epeleuton may exert a beneficial effect in the early treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P9">In this work we determined the distribution of 15(S)-HEPE in lungs and other tissues of interest and subsequently assessed the potential of orally administered epeleuton to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve histopathological outcomes in the Syrian hamster model. We show that epeleuton decreases viral loads, viral RNA and pathology in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. These findings support the potential of epeleuton as an orally administered drug for the early treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<title>Orally administered Epeleuton accumulates in the lungs and other organs</title>
<p id="P10">Epeleuton (15(S)-HEPE EE) is rapidly de-esterified to its active moiety, 15(S)-HEPE following oral administration. 15(S)-HEPE is expected to exhibit similar distribution as generally known for fatty acids absorbed orally - solubilised as chylomicrons, distributed to various tissues, and released as free fatty acids through the action of tissue lipoprotein lipases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Herein, we sought to investigate the tissue distribution pattern of orally administered 15(S)-HEPE EE or vehicle in Sprague Dawley rats (n=5/group) following a QDx7 dosing schedule.</p>
<p id="P11">Post-mortem tissue analysis (Day 8) revealed significant increases in the concentrations of 15(S)-HEPE in the tissues of treated animals compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The mean concentrations of absorbed 15(S)-HEPE in various tissues 24 hours after the last administration of Epeleuton are as follows; Lung (6742 ng/g), heart (272 ng/g), liver (610 ng/g), kidneys (923 ng/g), skin (299 ng/g), eyes (200.96 ng/g) and spleen (1975 ng/g). On Day 8, 24 hours after the last administration, 15(S)-HEPE concentrations were below the limit of detection in the plasma and brain of treated rats in line with the plasma pharmacokinetics of the compound. While increases in 15(S)-HEPE concentrations were significant across all organs, the greatest concentrations compared to control were detected in the lungs (0ng/g vehicle control vs 6742ng/g 500mg/kg Epeleuton, P = &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Epeleuton exerts a dose dependent reduction in viral replication assessed by infectious titers in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P12">Due to an inherent susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, Syrian hamsters are a commonly used model of SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics and therapeutic response. However, given the self-limiting nature of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Syrian hamsters in which the virus naturally clears by day 7 post challenge (p.c) it was critical to establish steady state concentrations of epeleuton early in the course of infection, enabling assessment of its therapeutic effect and ultimately mimicking a clinical loading dose<sup>

<p id="P13">Epeleuton dose selection was based on human equivalent doses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup> corresponding to a 2g/day and 4g/day clinical dose, a well-tolerated clinical dosing regimen for epeleuton employed in ongoing clinical trials. All animals were administered vehicle or epeleuton (250mg/kg or 500mg/kg) once daily for 5 days prior to challenge with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the antiviral effects of epeleuton, nine- to ten-week-old male hamsters (n=18) were inoculated intranasally with a dose of 1x10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2. Treatment continued for 3 days. All animals were sacrificed on day 4 p.c. for tissue collection.</p>
<p id="P14">Viral shedding was determined from daily throat swabs. The lower limit of quantification was determined to be 0.8 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml, and represents undetectable viral titers. In the vehicle control arm, viral titers of 2.7 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml were detected at day 1 (n=6). Peak viral shedding was detected on day 2 (3.6 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) with subsequent decreases in viral titer at days 3 and 4 (2.8 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml and 1.8 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Epeleuton, when administered at a 250mg/kg dose, decreased viral shedding on days 1 and 2 characterised by significant (p = &lt; 0.05) reductions in viral titer of 1.6 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml and 1.9 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml respectively. An improved effect on viral shedding was observed in animals that received 500mg/kg epeleuton. Significant decreases in viral shedding were observed up to 3 days p.c.. At both days 1 and 2, viral titers were undetectable (0.8 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) in animals treated with 500mg/kg Epeleuton. A significant reduction (p = &lt; 0.05) of 1.2 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml was observed on day 3.</p>
<p id="P16">Viral replication and infectious titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates were determined from tissue samples on day 4, the peak of viral load and replication. Epeleuton decreased lung viral titers in a dose-dependent manner. A mean titer of 8.0 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g was detected in the lungs of vehicle control hamsters on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Treatment with 250mg/kg epeleuton reduced viral titers in the lungs by 1.3 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g (non-significant). Epeleuton when administered at a higher dose produced a significantly improved effect reducing infectious titers in the lungs by 3.1 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g. Epeleuton produced a similar non-significant trend in nasal turbinates. Treatment with 250mg/kg and 500mg/kg epeleuton reduced viral titers in the nasal turbinates by 1.1 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g and 1.7 Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<p id="P17">As a secondary measure of viral shedding, viral RNA genome copy number was quantified in daily throat swabs, nasal turbinates and lung tissue. The lower limit of quantification was determined to be 1.9 Log10 copies/ml/g, and represents undetectable viral RNA. In the vehicle control arm, viral RNA of 5.6 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml were detected at day 1 (n=6). Peak viral RNA was detected on day 2 (6.8 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) with subsequent decreases in viral RNA at days 3 and 4 (5.9 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml and 5.3 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Epeleuton administered at doses of 250mg/kg and 500mg/kg resulted in significant dose dependent reductions (p = &lt; 0.05) in viral RNA up to 3 days p.c (500mg/kg).

An improved effect on viral shedding was observed in animals that received 500mg/kg epeleuton. Treatment significantly reduced viral shedding (measured by viral RNA) on days 1, 2 and 3 by 3.1 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml, 4.2 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml and 2.0 Log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml respectively.</p>
<p id="P19">Viral RNA in the lungs and nasal turbinate was determined at day 4 p.c.. A mean titer of 10.5 Log<sub>10</sub> CP/g was detected in the lungs of vehicle control hamsters. Treatment with 250mg/kg epeleuton reduced viral RNA in the lungs by 1.1 Log<sub>10</sub> CP/g (non-significant). This effect was seen to be dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). When administered at a higher dose, epeleuton produced a significantly improved effect (p = &lt; 0.05) reducing viral RNA in the lungs by 2.9 Log<sub>10</sub> CP/g. Epeleuton produced a similar dose-dependent trend in nasal turbinates. Treatment with 250mg/kg reduced viral RNA in the nasal turbinates by 1.1 Log<sub>10</sub> CP/g (non-significant). An improved significant response (p = &lt; 0.05) was observed following treatment with 500mg/kg epeleuton.

<title>Epeleuton ameliorates upper and lower airway SARS-CoV-2 pathology and inflammation</title>
<p id="P20">Challenge with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a mean weight loss of 6% in the vehicle arm. Epeleuton attenuated SARS-CoV-2 related weight loss in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Consistent with the known disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters no other clinical signs were observed in any treatment group. All animals (n = 18) survived the viral challenge until the scheduled time point of autopsy.</p>
<p id="P21">Upper and lower respiratory tract involvement is the most common manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. In order to assess the effects of epeleuton against the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasal turbinate and lung tissue were harvested and processed for histopathological analysis at day 4 p.c., the peak of lung viral load and replication in the Syrian hamster model. A summary of histological scores is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S3</xref>. No lungs showed definite evidence of interfering concurrent infections (e.g., bacteria or fungi), nor was aspiration of foreign material clearly observed.</p>
<p id="P22">All animals except one (500mg/kg Epeleuton) showed inflammatory changes in the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) consisting of infiltrating heterophilic granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes. The most severe rhinitis was present in the vehicle arm (score: 2.83) with decreased rhinitis observed in the 250mg/kg (score 2.0), and 500mg/kg (score 1.17) epeleuton groups. Overall, the severity of rhinitis was significantly (p=&lt;0.05) reduced in animals treated with the higher dose of epeleuton compared to vehicle control.</p>

</sup>. Most animals showed inflammatory changes in the pulmonary parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a-4g</xref>). Alveolitis was characterized by infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes and macrophages. The most severe alveolitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) was seen in the vehicle arm (mean: 1.33) with decreased alveolitis severity observed in the 250mg/kg epeleuton and 500mg/kg epeleuton groups. A similar pattern is observed when summarizing the scores for severity and extent of alveolitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>): vehicle control (mean score: 2.16), 250mg/kg epeleuton (mean score: 0.83), and 500mg/kg epeleuton (mean score: 0.34). Reductions in both extent (-80%) and severity (-87%) of alveolitis were significant for the high dose epeleuton group only.</p>
<p id="P25">Additional inflammatory lesions consisted of rather mild changes of bronchioles but more severe inflammatory changes of the large bronchi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>).

The dose dependent reduction in severity of inflammation in the lower airways was significant for both doses of epeleuton. Perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing with infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, and less heterophils occurred in all groups to a variable extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P27">In this study, we used the Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess the effect of epeleuton, a second-generation novel n-3 fatty acid derivative of EPA on SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral load, replication and pathology. Epeleuton substantially reduced the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and upper airways based on both viral RNA genome copy number and infectious virus titers. Notably, at day 4, the peak of lung viral load in the Syrian hamster model there was significant inhibition of viral replication in the lung based on both infectious titers and viral RNA. This corresponded with markedly reduced lung and upper airway pathology, indicating improved disease outcome and potential for complete respiratory tract protection. Importantly, the observed decrease in extent and severity of alveolitis and lower airway inflammation may represent an important finding indicating therapeutic potential considering that one third of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 meet ARDS criteria and that autopsies from patients who died following severe COVID-19 reveal alveolar wall injury and diffuse alveolar damage<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P28">SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus’ pathology like all RNA viruses is complex and impacted by both host and pathogen burden. Epeleuton as a polyunsaturated fatty acid is expected to employ pleiotropic modes of action to influence SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, viral replication and disease outcome. A recent review by Theken et al. outlined the important roles that lipids play in the viral life cycle both through direct interactions with viruses and by modulating various aspects of host biology<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. As such, the observed effects of epeleuton in the Syrian hamster model are likely to consist of both direct antiviral effects and protection conferred by epeleuton’s effects on host immune response, including its known anti-inflammatory effects<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P29">Recent studies suggest several potential targets for fatty acid binding to SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acids can exert direct antiviral effects independent of host factors. The identified binding targets include a free fatty acid (FFA) binding pocket on the spike protein (S)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup> and a potentially druggable target on the transmembrane domain of the envelope protein (E) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Toelzer et al. found that linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid was tightly bound to the newly discovered FFA binding pocket. LA binding stabilized a locked conformation of the S protein, resulting in reduced ACE2 interaction. A similar binding pocket was also present in the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, a fatty acid binding pocket was previously exploited to develop a small-molecule antiviral therapeutic to treat rhinovirus which was successful in human clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. It is noteworthy that addition of LA and arachidonic acid, another polyunsaturated fatty acid, decreased replication of both MERS-CoV and HCoV-299E in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">Building on the discovery of the FFA binding pocket, using a spike protein pseudo-virus, it was demonstrated that both omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids including LA and EPA interfere with binding to ACE2 and significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. EPA is the metabolic precursor of epeleuton’s active moiety 15(S)-HEPE. Importantly, the presence of a conserved FFA binding pocket among various pathogenic coronaviruses suggests that this druggable target may be conserved in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and offers hope that if proven effective compounds targeting the FFA binding pocket may be less susceptible to the development of drug resistance.</p>
<p id="P31">The observed inhibitory effects of epeleuton against SARS-CoV-2 viral replication may also be explained in part by its effect on host biological pathways and immune response. In fact, the importance of metabolic pathways especially lipid metabolism on viral entry into cells may also partly explain the higher risk of severe disease among individuals with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. In a phase 2a clinical trial of epeleuton in patients with obesity and NAFLD, serum biomarker data provides several hints regarding systemic effects of epeleuton on the host lipidome which may impact SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this phase 2a clinical trial epeleuton significantly decreased concentrations of plasma free fatty acids<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, an observation that may be partly explained by the known inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FAS) by polyunsaturated fatty acids<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. FAS is a homodimeric multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes fatty acid synthesis, synthesising palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the presence of NADPH<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. In turn, palmitoylation modification of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to be an important step for viral infectivity, allowing the virus to interact with cell membranes and initiate viral fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. In a recent study Chu et al. demonstrated that FAS inhibitors could reduce cellular levels of free fatty acids and palmitoylated proteins. They subsequently demonstrated that FAS inhibitors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cell lines and hACE2 transgenic mice, and consequently that cellular lipid synthesis is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P32">Although future investigations will need to establish the relative contributions and mechanisms of direct antiviral effects and alterations of host biological pathways to epeleuton’s efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the outcomes observed in the present model, the clinical anti-inflammatory effects of epeleuton and the extensive literature supporting opportunities for therapeutic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 with polyunsaturated fatty acids are encouraging. Notably, epeleuton is furthest in clinical development as a cardiometabolic treatment (NCT04365400) and given the contributions of vascular and endothelial dysfunction to the persistent and prolonged effects of COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, epeleuton may hold additional promise in the prevention and amelioration of long COVID.</p>
<p id="P33">A limitation of the present study is that treatment was initiated pre-infection to account for potential pharmacokinetic differences between hamsters and other species used in previous studies of epeleuton, and to ensure steady state levels are achieved early in the course of infection. Polyunsaturated fatty acids may take days to reach therapeutic concentrations in plasma and desired tissues. Consequently, while the observed results indicate that epeleuton exerts protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and end-organ outcomes, the study design leaves some uncertainty regarding the potential treatment window. However, the marked effects of epeleuton on lung and upper airway pathology are consistent with previous findings that direct acting antivirals including for SARS-CoV-2 tend to improve disease outcome when administered early in the course of infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P34">To overcome the pharmacokinetic challenge posed by the acute course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cardiolink-9, a recent small exploratory phase 2a clinical trial of icosapent ethyl, an ethyl ester formulation of EPA, in patients with COVID-19 employed a loading dose. This trial provided the first human experience with a 4g BID (8 g/day) loading dose of a fatty acid therapy. The trialled treatment regimen demonstrated favourable short-term safety and tolerability, comparable to usual care, and resulted in significant improvements in inflammatory markers and patient symptom scores from baseline<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Since EPA is the metabolic precursor of 15(S)-HEPE this trial provided a template dosing strategy for epeleuton. Future clinical trials could employ a similar strategy with a loading dose of epeleuton to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations of 15(S)-HEPE.</p>
<p id="P35">Although epeleuton decreased both upper airway and lung pathology while simultaneously substantially decreasing viral replication in the lungs and attenuating body weight loss, an apparent increase in viral shedding is observed in the throats of hamsters at day 4 after infection. The significance of this finding seems tenuous because importantly it contrasts to the marked and consistent improvements in disease outcome across both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Further characterisation of the antiviral mechanism of action of epeleuton against SARS-CoV-2 may aid in ascertaining the relevance of this observation. However, previous studies in the Syrian hamster model indicate that the effects of treatment on viral replication in the lung are more relevant than viral shedding to disease outcome. The nucleoside analog MK-4482’s (molnupiravir) hamster and clinical data provide supportive evidence. In the Syrian hamster model, molnupiravir inhibited both lung pathology and viral replication in the lung but did not decrease viral shedding measured with oral swabs at days 2 and 4<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Encouragingly molnupiravir’s efficacy in the hamster model was replicated clinically, with results indicating that early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P36">The need for an expanded armamentarium for the treatment of COVID-19 is especially evident considering the potential for the development of drug resistance to existing therapies and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Combination therapy utilising drugs with different mechanisms of action may add to the treatment options available and may be more effective than single agents by exploiting potentially additive effects. Instructive precedents include combination approaches for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus which yielded improved efficacy compared to single agents as well as promising combination approaches for treating MERS-CoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Although the mechanism of action of epeleuton against SARS-CoV-2 requires further characterisation, it is anticipated that epeleuton acts through a distinct and unique mechanism compared to currently available therapeutics such as the nucleoside analogs remdesivir and molnupiravir, the REGN-COV2 monoclonal antibody combination, Paxlovid and corticosteroids. It is noteworthy that following the discovery of the FFA binding pocket on the S protein, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments revealed that supplementation of the polyunsaturated fatty acid LA synergizes with remdesivir, suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication more effectively than with remdesivir alone<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P37">Epeleuton is orally administered with a favourable safety and tolerability profile<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Epeleuton’s oral route of administration and stability at room temperature provide the possibility of early treatment and the potential for distribution to both high and low resource regions of the world in the fight to reduce COVID 19 disease burden. Currently, there is a paucity of oral therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment in an outpatient setting and there is an urgent need for new therapeutics. The present findings support the potential of epeleuton as a novel orally administered drug for the early treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies will be required to elucidate the therapeutic and preventative potential of epeleuton against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
