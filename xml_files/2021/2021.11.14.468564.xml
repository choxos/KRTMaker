Despite its strong association with invasive disease, little is known about enzymatic function beyond the ELR<sup>+</sup> CXC chemokine substrate range. As a serine protease, SpyCEP has a catalytic triad consisting of aspartate (D151), histidine (H279), and serine (S617) residues which are all thought to be mandatory for full activity. We utilised a range of SpyCEP constructs to investigate the protein domains and catalytic residues necessary for enzyme function. We designed a high-throughput mass spectrometry assay to measure CXCL8 cleavage and applied this for the first time to study the enzyme kinetics of SpyCEP.</p><p id="P2">Results revealed a remarkably low Michaelis-Menton constant (K<sub>M</sub>) of 82 nM and a turnover of 1.65 molecules per second. We found that an N-terminally-truncated SpyCEP C-terminal construct containing just the catalytic dyad of H279 and S617 was capable of cleaving CXCL8 with a similar K<sub>M</sub> of 55 nM, albeit with a reduced substrate turnover of 2.7 molecules per hour, representing a 2,200-fold reduction in activity. We conclude that the SpyCEP C-terminus plays a key role in high affinity substrate recognition and binding, but that the N-terminus is required for full catalytic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic></kwd><kwd>virulence factor</kwd><kwd>serine protease</kwd><kwd>SpyCEP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> is a leading human pathogen that manifests clinically as a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from less severe, usually self-limiting infections to life-threatening invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. While much of the global health burden of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> can be attributed to auto-immune sequelae such as rheumatic heart disease, invasive diseases contribute greatly to <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>-associated global mortality. At least 663,000 new cases of invasive infection arise per year, accounting for approximately 163,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] with mortality rates remaining high despite intervention; indeed, 20% of patients with invasive <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> disease die within 7 days of infection onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Several virulence factors contribute to pathogenesis in invasive <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> disease, chief among which is <italic><underline>S</underline>treptococcus <underline>p</underline>yogenes</italic> <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>e</underline>nvelope <underline>p</underline>rotease (SpyCEP), an immune-modulatory cell wall-associated protease. SpyCEP is responsible for the rapid and efficient cleavage of a distinct group of CXC chemokines comprising CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7, and CXCL8, both locally at the site of an infection, and systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The ELR<sup>+</sup> chemokines, named for their conserved N-terminal glutamate-leucine-arginine motifs, specifically act upon neutrophils eliciting their recruitment and activation. SpyCEP inactivates these chemokines by cleaving the chemokine C-terminal α-helix, releasing a 13 amino acid peptide in the case of CXCL8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Although chemokine specificity for binding neutrophil chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, is conferred to a large extent by the chemokine N-terminal ELR motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], the chemokine C-terminus is necessary for efficient receptor binding and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], in addition to chemokine translocation from tissues to endothelial lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. As such, SpyCEP cleavage of CXC chemokines results in a reduction of CXCR1 and CXCR2-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and subsequent paucity of neutrophils at the site of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. SpyCEP has recently been shown to cleave the human anti-microbial peptide, LL-37 in addition to chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Whilst cleavage does not affect the antimicrobial action of the peptide, it was reported to reduce LL-37 specific neutrophil chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">SpyCEP is expressed by <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> as a 1647 amino acid, 180 kDa subtilisin-like serine protease, the crystal structure of which was recently solved to 2.8 Å resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and further refined to 2.2 Å resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. It is a member of the S8 subtilase family, members of which are characterised by a catalytic triad consisting of an aspartate, histidine, and serine residue, each surrounded by a region of highly conserved amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. SpyCEP is unique among streptococcal proteases in that, during maturation, it is autocatalytically cleaved between residues Q244 and S245 into 2 distinct polypeptides, a 30 kDa N-terminal polypeptide and a 150 kDa C-terminal polypeptide. The two polypeptides harbour the separate residues required for the formation of the catalytic site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]; the N-terminal fragment contains the catalytic D151 residue, and the C-terminal fragment contains the catalytic H279 and S617 residues. Upon cleavage, the two polypeptides re-associate non-covalently to reconstitute the active enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The recent crystal structures have shed further light upon the structure of SpyCEP, describing 9 separate domains, the first 5 of which contain the catalytic triad necessary for enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P6">SpyCEP has been included as a target antigen in several recent <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> vaccine designs due to its cell surface expression, highly conserved nature, and central role in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> pathogenesis. Immunisation with SpyCEP successfully elicits a SpyCEP-specific neutralising antibody response, providing protection against systemic bacterial dissemination and reducing disease severity in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> intramuscular, skin infection models and non-human primate infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Data that demonstrate vaccine dependence on enzyme inhibition highlight the importance of understanding the enzymatic activity of SpyCEP and the potential to improve upon vaccine or inhibitor design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Despite this, little is known about the catalytic properties of the enzyme, except preliminary structure-function studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Published data largely focus on the impact of SpyCEP on streptococcal pathogenesis and disease progression. In this study we generated multiple SpyCEP constructs to confirm domains necessary for catalytic activity.

Western blot analysis confirmed cleavage of LL-37 by full-length recombinant SpyCEP, demonstrated by a reduction in band size, however the C-terminal fragment was unable to cleave LL-37 despite a high molar ratio of enzyme to LL-37 (1: 10) and a prolonged 16-hour incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Differential cleavage of CXCL8 and CXCL1 by full-length and C-terminal SpyCEP</title><p id="P24">To determine whether the catalytic activity of the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment was reproducible over a shorter incubation period, we assessed CXCL8 cleavage by ELISA, where CXCL8 cleavage is detected through a reduction in substrate concentration. SpyCEP C-terminal constructs were incubated with CXCL8 at molar ratios ranging from 1:5 – 1:250 (enzyme: chemokine) over a 60-minute time course at room temperature. Full-length recombinant SpyCEP and the inactive C-terminal fragment, C-terminal<sup>S617A</sup>, were included as controls at a molar ratio of 1:1000 and 1:5, respectively. Under these conditions, near complete CXCL8 cleavage was observed for full-length SpyCEP and a dose-dependent increase in catalytic activity was observed for the C-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). After 5 minutes incubation full-length SpyCEP cleaved over 50% of the starting CXCL8 input, with only 6.25% of CXCL8 remaining after 1 hour. At the highest concentration of C-terminal SpyCEP tested, a 1:5 molar ratio, the C-terminal fragment alone cleaved 9% of the starting CXCL8 by 5 minutes, 25% by 30 minutes and 42% by 60 minutes. Indeed, at the lowest concentration tested, a 1:250 molar ratio, the C-terminal of SpyCEP cleaved 9% of CXCL8 input by 1 hour. As demonstrated by immunofluorescent western blotting, the serine residue at position 617 was vital for SpyCEP catalytic function, as no CXCL8 cleavage was observed using the C-terminal<sup>S617A</sup> construct, even when employed at the highest enzyme: chemokine ratio. After a 1-hour incubation, full-length SpyCEP and C-terminal constructs (assayed using a molar enzyme: chemokine ratio of 1:5, 1:25 and 1:50) cleaved significantly more CXCL8 compared to the C-terminal<sup>S617A</sup> construct.</p><p id="P25">SDS-PAGE analysis of the catalytic activity of the C-terminal SpyCEP construct additionally showed that C-terminal activity was not restricted to the CXCL8 substrate. Over 2 hours at 37 °C using a 1:5 molar ratio of enzyme: substrate, the SpyCEP C-terminal construct was capable of cleaving human CXCL1 to near completion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To further assess the activity of SpyCEP and to interrogate reaction rates against separate chemokines, full-length SpyCEP was incubated with CXCL1 and CXCL8 and the remaining chemokine levels determined by ELISA. Human CXCL1 or human CXCL8 were incubated with SpyCEP at room temperature over a 30-minute time course, at 1:200 or 1:400 molar ratios respectively (enzyme: chemokine). 5 fmol of SpyCEP rapidly and efficiently cleaved 2 pmol CXCL8, with – 15% of the chemokine input remaining after 10 minutes of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This contrasted with CXCL1 cleavage, that required 10 fmol SpyCEP to cleave just 25% of the chemokine input over the same 10-minute period. Indeed, by 30 minutes SpyCEP had yet to cleave half of the starting amount of CXCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Utilising a linear regression of the initial 5 timepoints, where SpyCEP activity is maximal, we found that 5 fmol of SpyCEP was able to cleave 284 fmol of CXCL8 per minute, and 10 fmol of SpyCEP was capable of cleaving 62 fmol of CXCL1 per minute. These data confirmed the activity of recombinant SpyCEP and highlighted differential cleavage efficiency across the CXC substrate range – a feature which has been previously recognised but not quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Mass spectrometry-derived kinetics of active SpyCEP constructs</title><p id="P27">To directly compare the active full-length and C-terminal SpyCEP constructs and to understand relative catalytic efficiencies, a mass spectrometry approach to continuously assay the generation of the 13 amino acid peptide cleaved from the native substrate CXCL8, following incubation with enzyme, was employed. A range of CXCL8 concentrations (25-2000 nM) were incubated with a fixed concentration of enzyme, either 250 pM of full length SpyCEP, or 40 nM of the C-terminal SpyCEP<sup>245-1613</sup> and the production of the 13 amino acid peptide was monitored over time. 250 pM full-length SpyCEP cleaved CXCL8 to near completion over 30 minutes when substrate concentrations were less than 250 nM; incomplete CXCL8 cleavage was observed when substrate concentration was in excess of 250 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). In contrast, 40 nM of the C-terminal SpyCEP<sup>245-1613</sup> cleaved CXCL8 to near completion over 4 hours when the CXCL8 concentration was 250 nM or less; incomplete CXCL8 cleavage was again observed when substrate concentrations were over 250 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Under these conditions the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment maintained measurable catalytic activity throughout, though with reduced efficacy compared to the full-length construct. A 160-fold increase in enzyme concentration and additional 3.5 hours reaction time were required to cleave a comparable amount of CXCL8.</p><p id="P28">Linear regression analyses of 5 time points, where the rate of cleaved CXCL8 production was linear, were used to derive Michaelis-Menton plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and K<sub>M</sub> and K<sub>cat</sub> values for each construct (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). K<sub>M</sub> values for full-length SpyCEP and the C-terminal fragment were 82 nM and 55 nM respectively, suggesting nanomolar affinity of the SpyCEP constructs for CXCL8. The similarity in the K<sub>M</sub> values between the C- terminal SpyCEP fragment and the full-length enzyme point to a similar ability to bind substrate. The K<sub>cat</sub> values (indicative of the number of molecules of cleaved CXCL8 produced per second) however, differed substantially. The full-length enzyme cleaved 1.65 molecules of CXCL8 per second compared to the C-terminal construct which cleaved 2.7 molecules per hour, a 2,200-fold reduction in activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">SpyCEP is a serine protease and a leading virulence factor of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, with a narrow range of substrate specificity, restricted to the family of ELR<sup>+</sup> CXC chemokines which modulate neutrophil mediated immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and LL-37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Autocatalytic processing of SpyCEP results in the generation of two individual fragments that re-assemble to form an active enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Here, we describe the enzyme kinetics of full-length SpyCEP and report the K<sub>M</sub> of the enzyme for its natural substrate to be remarkably low, just 81.76 nM, consistent with high efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment can catalyse the cleavage of CXCL1 and CXCL8 independent of the N-terminal fragment. Indeed, when K<sub>M</sub> values were compared, they were found to be similar, suggesting that substrate binding may be confined to the C-terminal domain of SpyCEP. The enzymatic activity of the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment was, however, markedly reduced compared to full-length SpyCEP. The N-terminal and N-terminal<sup>D151A</sup> constructs were equally able to restore full catalytic activity of the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment. Collectively, this suggests that although the aspartate 151 of the N-terminal fragment may be dispensable for catalysis, the domain itself is important for optimal enzyme activity.</p><p id="P30">Serine proteases are ubiquitous and comprise up to one third of all proteolytic enzymes currently described. They are currently categorised by the MEROPS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] into 13 distinct clans, being differentiated into groups of proteins based on their evolution from the same common ancestor, with SpyCEP belonging to the S8 family of the SB clan. S8 serine proteases are typified by a classical catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine and aspartic acid residues that together contribute to the hydrolysis of a peptide bond within the substrate. It is recognised that a number of serine protease clans employ a variation on the S8 catalytic triad, utilising instead a triad of serine, histidine, and glutamic acid, or serine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid residues. Other clans utilise catalytic dyads of lysine and histidine or histidine and serine for proteolytic activity. Our data suggest that SpyCEP activity can reside in a catalytic dyad of histidine and serine, albeit at a greatly reduced efficacy. It is likely this large gulf in efficiency explains the failure of previous studies to detect catalytic activity within the isolated C-terminal SpyCEP fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P31">Within serine proteases there are additional features, beyond the catalytic triad residues, which can contribute to activity. The oxyanion hole for example, a pocket in the active site composed of backbone amide NH groups, may provide substrate stabilisation and help drive catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Additional residues located in close proximity to the catalytic pocket can also mitigate a loss of activity resulting from a missing residue, and water also has the potential to moonlight as a missing functional group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. These ‘stand ins’ can provide a possible substitute machinery to help drive catalytic function. Indeed, some studies have shown that, even with all three catalytic triad residues removed, serine proteases are still capable of catalysis at rates 1000-fold greater than the background rate of hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P32">Mass spectrometry-based kinetics showed that full-length active SpyCEP has a K<sub>M</sub> of 82 nM and K<sub>cat</sub> of 1.65 molecules per second; values which are in agreement with our initial ELISA-based kinetic assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In contrast, the C-terminal fragment of SpyCEP has a K<sub>M</sub> of 55 nM and K<sub>cat</sub> of 0.00075 molecules per second. These constructs both demonstrated low, nanomolar K<sub>M</sub> values, suggesting a high binding efficiency of SpyCEP for its natural substrate CXCL8, likely conferred by the C-terminal domain. This is in keeping with the fact that low nanomolar concentrations of CXCL8 are optimal for neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Although K<sub>M</sub> values are often reported in the μM – mM range, nanomolar K<sub>M</sub> values are not without precedent for other serine proteases; human kallikrein 6 has a reported K<sub>M</sub> of 300 nM and Factor Xa, a constituent of the prothrombinase complex, has a K<sub>M</sub> of 150 nM for prothrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Enzyme specificity, a constant which measures the cleavage efficiency of enzymes, (K <sub>cat</sub> /K <sub>M</sub>), for full-length SpyCEP was estimated to be 2.02 x10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, a value in the order of magnitude typical for serine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The specificity constant of the C-terminal fragment was –1500-fold less, 1.36 x10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and K<sub>cat</sub> 2200 fold less, a reduction that is in line with previously reported aspartic acid mutants from a systematic mutational study of the <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> subtilisin catalytic triad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The development of an MS-based assay of SpyCEP activity, that is not dependent on western blotting or ELISA, provides potential for future high-throughput analysis of SpyCEP activity and detection of SpyCEP inhibitors.</p><p id="P33">The kinetic assays attributed a marked increase in CXCL8 turnover to the additional presence of the N-terminal fragment. Although we did not specifically evaluate the role of the aspartate residue at position 151 on the kinetics of SpyCEP activity, this residue did not contribute appreciably to cleavage of CXCL8 when evaluated using immunoblotting. This raises a question as to whether the N-terminal fragment confers some additional structural contribution to enzyme activity. Our data strongly suggest that substrate binding is likely to be attributed to the C-terminal fragment, a finding consistent with related cell envelope proteinases of <italic>Lactococci</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and the closely related streptococcal protein, C5a peptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P34">The implications of our findings relating to activity of the C-terminal SpyCEP fragment in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> pathogenesis are currently unclear; without the N-terminus, the enzymatic activity detected may be too low to be of consequence for chemokine cleavage <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in nature both N- and C-terminal fragments are likely to co-exist. SpyCEP has been a focus of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> vaccine development in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], used either in isolation or combination with other antigenic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Vaccine-induced SpyCEP specific antibodies appear not to act through traditional opsonic means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and so may act through inhibition of SpyCEP activity. Many vaccine preparations evaluated have been based on ‘CEP5’; a polypeptide spanning residues 35 – 587 of SpyCEP which contains the N-terminal fragment and only part of the C terminal fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Our findings relating to enzyme function suggest that antibodies targeting the C-terminal fragment of SpyCEP are more likely to provide greater neutralizing activity, and potentially improve vaccine efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS182609-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d156aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful for the support of a GSK Golden Triangle Discovery Partnership in Academia Collaboration (DPAC) that permitted development of the mass spectrometry high throughput cleavage assay and reagent provision.
