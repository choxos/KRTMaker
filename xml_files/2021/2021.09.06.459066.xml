Immunoreceptor Toll and its ligand Spaetzle have undergone duplication which may allow neofunctionalization and adaptation. Here we present cryo-EM structures and biophysical characterisation of low affinity Toll5A complexes that display transient but specific interactions with Spaetzle1C, forming asymmetric complexes, with only one ligand clearly resolved. Loop structures of Spaetzle1C and Toll5A intercalate, temporarily bridging the receptor C-termini to promote signalling. By contrast unbound receptors form head-to-head homodimers that keep the juxtamembrane regions far apart in an inactive conformation. Interestingly the transcriptional signature of Spaetzle1C differs from other Spaetzle cytokines and controls genes involved in innate immunity, metabolism and tissue regeneration. Taken together our results explain how upregulation of Spaetzle1C in the midgut and Toll5A in the salivary gland shape the concomitant immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Insect Toll receptors perform critical functions in both embryogenesis and innate immunity. They are part of an ancient defence system that also includes the immunodeficiency (IMD) pathway and are conserved in vertebrates as the Toll-like receptors. Tolls and TLRs have a modular structure with an ectodomain made up of leucine rich repeats (LRRs) and associated capping structures, a single transmembrane helix and a cytosolic Toll/Interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Most studies of innate immune function in insects have focussed on the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 9 Toll receptors that have diverse roles in development and other areas of cellular regulation as well as in immunity. Immune function is mediated mainly by the Toll receptor 1 (Toll1), while Toll6 and Toll7 are expressed in the nervous system and have equivalent functions to vertebrate neurotrophin receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Toll receptors are activated by a complementary family of six cytokine-like molecules called Spaetzle (Spz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Spz1 proteins are secreted as larger dimeric precursors consisting of a natively unstructured pro-domain, which is proteolytically cleaved upon activation and a C-terminal cystine-knot fold similar to that found in human neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Lys-type peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria is detected by recognition proteins PGRP-SA and GNBP1 and these complexes activate a cascade of serine proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The terminal proteinase, Spaetzle processing enzyme (SPE), has trypsin-like specificity and cleaves the Spz precursor specifically at the junction between the pro-domain and cystine-knot which remain associated by non-covalent interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast Spz2 (also called neurotrophin-1, NT1) and Spz5 (NT2) are cleaved during secretion by furin-like proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and the latter is secreted in a mature form without its pro-domain. Growing evidence suggests promiscuity in ligand binding, with Toll1 and Toll7 recognising Spz1, Spz2 and Spz5 and, more controversially, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, while Toll6 senses Spz2, Spz5 and possibly dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Mosquitoes and fruit flies are both dipterans but they diverged in evolution about 260 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Comparative genomic analysis of <italic>Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> reveals that most genes involved in innate immunity are conserved in the mosquito including the Toll and Spaetzle families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the Toll family has undergone significant diversification with the loss of orthologs in mosquitoes (no Toll2 or Toll3 in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, for example) and species-specific expansion of two more (Toll10 and Toll11). The underlying driving force of gene duplication is likely interconnected with the mosquito’s change to a hematophagous diet and the evolutionary arms-race between pathogens and insects. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll1 mediates most immune functions while in <italic>Aedes</italic> two gene reduplications have occurred to produce an orthologous group of four closely related receptors Toll1A, Toll1B, Toll5A and Toll5B. The phylogeny does not provide unequivocal evidence as to which of these receptors function in immunity or if they have acquired new functions upon diversification.</p><p id="P5">Although there is a clear evolutionary relationship between insect Tolls and vertebrate TLRs the latter appear to have evolved from a common ancestor of insect Toll9 and adapted to directly recognise a diverse range of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such a bacterial lipopolysaccharide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, vertebrate TLRs are bona fide pattern recognition receptors but insect Tolls are activated by endogenous cytokines or growth factors. Another distinction between Toll and TLRs is the kinetics of receptor activation. TLRs display positive cooperativity being activated over a narrow range of ligand concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. By contrast, the function of Toll1 in development requires a diffused gradient of active Spaetzle with different threshold concentrations specifying cell fates along the embryonic dorso-ventral axis. The same is thought to occur in the patterning of immune responses.</p><p id="P6">Structural studies have provided insight into the molecular mechanism by which PAMPS activate the TLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. A common feature is stimulus-induced dimerization of the receptor ectodomains or alternatively conformational rearrangement of a preformed inactive dimer. For example, double stranded RNA crosslinks two TLR3 ectodomains causing the juxtamembrane regions to move into close proximity and promote dimerization of the TIR domains in the cytosol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, TLR8 is expressed as a pre-formed dimer and the binding of small drug molecules or single stranded RNA induces a conformational rearrangement of the dimer interface that results in the tilting of the two ectodomains and, like TLR3, moves the juxtamembrane C-termini into close proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Similar mechanisms are likely operative in the activation of insect Tolls by Spz ligands. Biochemical evidence suggests that in insects the active complex has a stoichiometry of two molecules of receptor and two molecules of Spaetzle-C106 (2:2 complex) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, to date the only crystal structures of the Toll–C106 complex reveal a 1:1 complex with a binding mode that is reminiscent of mammalian neurotrophins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The covalent cystine-knot dimer forms asymmetric contacts at the concave side of the N-terminal domain within the first ten LRRs. In contrast to TLRs, Spz does not induce dimerization of the receptor in the crystal structure possibly because negative cooperativity requires that the active signalling complex is unstable.</p><p id="P7">Functionally, the Toll pathway has been involved in resistance against the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and Dengue viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, with fungal infections limiting viral replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Differential expression of duplicated Toll5A and Spz1C suggests that this pathway is regulated in a tissue and microbe-specific manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Here, we use purified proteins to further characterise Toll5A-Spz1C interactions and the impact of their relative concentrations on stoichiometry. Single particle cryo-EM reveals that the receptor is reversibly assembled in an asymmetric complex, in which C-terminal regions are brought into proximity upon Spz1C binding, which is a structural requirement for signal transduction. Along with Spz1C-induced <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Aag2 cell signalling, our study sheds light on the effect of duplication and shows the importance of revisiting Toll signalling in hematophagous insects that impact human health.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cryo-EM structures of Toll5A and Spz1C</title><p id="P8">Recombinant Toll5A ectodomain was mixed with a 3-fold molar excess of Spz1C and the resulting complex was then purified by size exclusion chromatography immediately prior to grid preparation as described in Methods. Three oligomeric states of the receptor were observed at near atomic resolutions, suggesting that Toll5A is highly dynamic in the presence of Spz1C. Homodimers of Toll5A at 3.41 Å maximum resolution had 85,810 particles, 2:1 heterodimers of Toll5A bound to Spz1C at 4.23 Å had 40,153 particles, and a 3:1 heterotrimer at 3.74 Å had 42,866 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). While all three types of particles spread randomly across the grid, according to their large Euler angular distribution, they display significant variations in local resolutions, likely a consequence of their stoichiometric and conformational heterogeneity. Overall, the N-terminal LRR domains of each receptor chain were better resolved than their C-terminal moieties with the latter partially truncated upon density modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Similarly, two ligands are observed but only one is well resolved, while the density of the second one is partial and seems to be restricted to the cys-knot core of the molecule. Although there is space to accommodate a second ligand without any steric clashes, the lack of resolution in this area does not allow visualisation. The heterodimer complex is therefore treated as a 2:1 complex. The vacated ligand binding site is occupied by another receptor chain in the 3:1 heterotrimer, illustrating the transition between homo- and heterodimerisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The three Toll5A molecules observed are referred to as chain A (teal), chain B (dark blue) and chain C (powder blue) in superimposable conformations in all three structures (RMSD below 2 Å). The Spz1C homodimer is composed of chain D (for distal, in yellow) and chain P (for proximal, in orange), attached to Toll5A chain A at the concave side and to chain B at its “back” or convex side.</p><p id="P9">The structure of Toll5A homodimers (chains A and B) was solved at the highest overall resolutions (3.4 – 4.4 Å), with a head-to-head arrangement, maintaining the C-terminal juxtamembrane regions far apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The C<italic>α</italic> atoms of Cys-783 at the C-termini of each receptor chain are separated by 207 Å. Such a structural arrangement –if sterically possible when the receptor is expressed on the same cell– would ensure that Toll5A is locked in an inactivate state preventing TIR domain association and signalling. If receptors are situated on neighbouring cells, such an orientation might be relevant to cell adhesion.</p><p id="P10">The overall structure of Toll5A is comparable to DmToll with a conserved number of leucine-rich repeats in both the N- and C-terminal domains, and conserved cysteine-rich capping structures surrounding these domains. The sequences of Toll5A and DmToll1 are 30 % identical and 50 % similar. In particular, the extended N-terminal cap formed by two hairpins and a parallel <italic>β</italic>-sheet, which is involved in Spz binding, is conserved in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Toll5A but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll-5, also known as Tehao, which remains an orphan receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Superposition of Toll5A and DmToll structures reveals that the diameter of the N-terminal LRR solenoid of Toll5A is 5-10 Å greater compared to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll1 receptor, with an inner diameter of about 50 Å and an outer diameter of 90 Å and an overall RMSD of 3 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Toll5A has nine predicted glycosylation sites, 6 of which were observed (Asn-linked glycans visible at positions 151, 194, 481, 521, 634 and 687) and found to restrict access to its surface. In contrast, DmToll has thirteen sites, which are not conserved with Toll5A, except for Asn-481 on the ascending flank of LRR15. Glycans restrict protein-protein contacts on the concave surface and the flanks of the receptor.</p><p id="P12">Toll5A forms head-head symmetric homodimers with LRRNT1 cap residues between Thr-34 and Tyr-79 binding the concave surface in the vicinity of Tyr-202 (LRR4) to Asn-419 (LRR13). For instance, Tyr-56 is hydrogen bonded to Tyr 226 for each chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The buried surface area is about 1,000 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Interestingly, receptor-receptor contacts in Toll5A differ from those observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which involve the N-terminal capping region and the hinge region between LRR domains. The Toll5A homodimer interface overlaps with the Spz1C ligand binding site, which suggests a direct competition between receptor-receptor and receptor-ligand interactions. Moreover, the presence of unliganded receptor in the Toll5A-Spz1C sample suggests that ligand binding is reversible.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SpzlC binding breaks receptor symmetry</title><p id="P13">We observed a ligated heterodimer of Toll5A with a stoichiometry of two receptor ectodomains to one Spz1C ligand (2:1 complex) at a lower resolution (4.2 – 8.4 Å). Spz1C is a covalent dimer stabilised by two intermolecular disulphide bonds instead of one in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The central disulphide bond between Cys-94 is conserved in DmSpz, while Spz1C has an additional intermolecular bond between Cys-59 located basally in an area directly involved in binding to the N-terminal concave surface of the receptor. Proximal Cys-59 is located within hydrogen bonding distance of the hydroxyl group of Toll5A Tyr-226 in LRR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The concave interface formed by the N-terminus up to LRR7 buries only ∼ 890 Å<sup>2</sup> of accessible surface area, which represents less than half that observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spz possesses a five-residue insertion (Asn-59 – Gln-62) in the vicinity of mosquito Cys-59, which expands its interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Nonetheless, Spz1C adopts an asymmetric binding mode, reminiscent of that found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> despite the lack of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), in which chain P contributes about 610 Å<sup>2</sup> and chain D, 280 Å<sup>2</sup> to the concave binding site. The interactions of Spz1C chain P at the concave site involves mostly residues from the first and third β-strand of Spz1C (Gln-14 and Leu-16, and Tyr-71, respectively) with the LRRNT1 of Toll5A (Tyr-79<sup>A</sup>, Tyr-65<sup>A</sup> and His-54<sup>A</sup>, respectively). Hydrogen bonds occur between His-18 in the Spz1C Trp-loop and the Phe-60 main-chain carboxy group in the receptor. Spz1C Tyr-38<sup>P</sup> and Toll5A Tyr-56<sup>A</sup> interact with side chain-mediated contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). There is a salt bridge between Arg-156<sup>A</sup> in Toll5A LRR2 and Glu-11<sup>P</sup> in Spz1C. The same residue in chain D is solvent-exposed and not well resolved in density. Glycans linked to Asn-521<sup>B</sup> on LRR17 restrict Spz1C spatially in the vicinity of Arg-50 and Gln-51 in chain D. As most side chains are poorly resolved, we generated a full-atom complex upon side chain modelling, which is suitable for surface analysis. Neither the electrostatic and hydrophobic networks of interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) nor the position of interacting glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) are conserved between mosquito and <italic>Drosophila</italic> complexes.</p><p id="P14">The overall structure of Spz1C is however, very similar to DmSpz, if the flexible Trp-loops between residues His-18 and Gln-40, and the β-wings between residues Tyr-71 and Val-89, are omitted. Indeed, the R.M.S.D of superimposed Cys-knot domains is about 2.2 Å over 53 C<italic>α</italic> atoms in the absence of these flexible regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in the mosquito Toll5A-Spz1C complex, these loops define asymmetric contacts at the dimerization interface with the “back” of chain B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Chain D of Spz1C binds extensively to the dimerization interface with over 1,300 Å<sup>2</sup> of its accessible surface area, while chain P contributes only 180 Å<sup>2</sup>, confined to a loop that protrudes from the convex side of LRR14. Remarkably, the integrity of the LRR14 loop seems to determine the dynamic interactions between Toll5A and Spz1C, while its cleavage stabilises the complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6-7</xref>). This property is reminiscent of the Z-loop of nucleic-sensing TLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We will therefore refer to it as the Z-loop with conserved Asn and Asp residues suitable for Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, while noting the absence of a cathepsin site in Toll5A.</p><p id="P15">In the crystal structure of refolded DmSpz, the <italic>β</italic>-wings (residues 75-93) are symmetric in both protomers, displaced from the Cys-knot framework by 90° and participating in crystal packing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. By contrast in our cryo-EM structure, the <italic>β</italic>-wings adopt a very different conformation contacting the Z-loop in a pincer like grasp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>). Molecular surface analysis of the receptor and the ligand suggests that the electrostatic charge distribution and shape complementarity are suitable for receptor-ligand coupling upon conformational selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The dimerization interface of 1,480 Å<sup>2</sup> is one and a half times the area of the concave binding surface, suggesting a higher affinity binding compared to the concave interface, while the absence of particles with a stoichiometry of 1:1 may indicate a sequential mechanism of assembly in nonequilibrium unsaturated complexes.</p><p id="P16">Interestingly, Spz1C possesses highly asymmetric Trp-loops. The distal one is extended and participates in dimerization with Trp-31<sup>D</sup> stacking against Phe-610<sup>B</sup> at the junction between LRR domains. The other loop adopts a short helical structure, which buries Trp-31<sup>P</sup> in a hydrophobic network that includes receptor N-terminal residue Phe-60<sup>A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). It is possible to model Spz1C with both protomers in a closed conformation based on a proximal template. Such a conformation results in a perfectly symmetric ligand able to bind Toll5A but unable to dimerise due to clashes between <italic>β</italic>-wings and the Z-loop. Equally, it is possible to model a fully extended Spz1C based on the distal protomer as a template. The resulting structure presents <italic>β</italic>-wings open wider for Z-loop interactions than the asymmetric ligand. More importantly, it exposes Trp-31<sup>P</sup> for potential interactions with the N-terminal cap of the primary receptor A, which might be required for fully dissociating asymmetric receptor-receptor contacts remaining in this area.</p><p id="P17">The N-terminal region of Toll5A (chain B) deviates by an angle of ∼ 60°, compared to the axis traversing chain C from N- to C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). There is evidence of extra density in the original 2:1 heterodimer map that matches the dimensions of a Cys-knot domain without its loops. This indicates that Spz loops and wings only adopt a stable conformation upon receptor dimerization. As there is no possible contact at the dimer interface for the second ligand, we propose that the asymmetric disposition of the receptor chains is the molecular basis of negative cooperativity in the system, where binding of the first ligand in non-saturating conditions makes binding of a second molecule energetically unfavourable. In the presence of saturating ligand concentrations, symmetric ligand binding may occur, in which both ligands can make reciprocal interactions with the receptor heterodimer.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Toll5A ectodomain competes with ligand binding</title><p id="P18">A third particle was observed with a stoichiometry of 3 receptors and 1 ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>). It is a hybrid of the homodimer (Toll5A chains A and C) and the 2:1 Toll5A-Spz1C heterodimer (Toll5A chains A and B) leading to a trimer of A, B and C chains, with Spz1C bound to the back of chain B and the concave side of chain A without any further contacts with chain C. Some minor differences are observed in main-chain and side-chains positions, which might be due to flexibility in both receptor and ligand molecules and the intermediate resolution of the heterotrimer map at 3.7 – 4.7 Å, compared to the homo- and heterodimer. While binding of a first Spz1C ligand shifts the receptor to adopt an asymmetric dimer configuration, the second binding site remains predominantly associated to another receptor chain.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Receptor specificity is achieved with low ligand binding affinity</title><p id="P19">The interaction between Spz1C, and the ectodomain of Toll5A was characterised using a range of biophysical techniques.

In the presence of 20 μM Toll5A saturated with Spz1C, a complex formed that was polydisperse but at 50 μM Toll5A saturated with Spz1C, the mixture appeared monodisperse with a mass corresponding to 206 kDa. SEC-MALS indicates a mass of 175 kDa for the unbound receptor dimer so the 206 kDa form is consistent with a 2:1 complex of Toll5A and a disulphide linked Spz1C dimer (26 kDa).</p><p id="P21">We then explored this 2:1 complex further using SEC-SAXS at 50 <italic>μ</italic>M and compared it to the receptor homodimer at the same concentration and in the same buffer.

The concentration-dependent stoichiometry differs from SEC-MALS, for which monomeric receptor was observed at 20 <italic>μ</italic>M, most likely as a consequence of sample dilution or the effect of the matrix on protein-protein interactions during the size-exclusion chromatography step that precedes MALS.</p><p id="P23">The shape of the AUC curves indicates that receptor-receptor interactions undergo slow exchanges, defined by discrete peaks at 5.6S, and 7.3S, respectively.

Toll5A forms heterogenous complexes with its ligand, which may include a 1:1 complex at 6.7 S, as well as 7.3 S (homodimers) and 7.8 S species (2:1 heterodimers) in different conformational states. However, in the presence of excess Spz1C, better resolved molecular species sediment as two distinct populations of 6.7 S and 8.5 S.

Our experimental setting was able to measure accurately molecules and complexes above 60 kDa, while free Spz1C was below the threshold, which resulted in erroneous mass determination. At 25 nM Toll5A in the presence of 25 nM Spz1C, Toll5A is predominantly monomeric but a 2:1 complex is detected along with a species at 48 kDa, corresponding most likely to Spz1C. By contrast, at 50 nM Toll5 in the presence of 50 nM Spz1C, 1:1 ligated monomer and 2:2 heterodimer complexes appear in addition to Toll5A monomer and 2:1 complex. Hence, mass photometry detects stoichiometric conversions in non-equilibrium conditions. Toll5A homodimer is not detected consistent with the AUC data that suggests a K<sub>D</sub> value for this interaction in the μM range. None of these techniques detected the heterotrimer, which is therefore most likely a side effect of cryo-EM’s capacity of visualising transition intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Spz1C drives the production of antimicrobial peptides</title><p id="P25">In order to assay the activity of Spz1C, we stimulated the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line Aag2, which constitutively expresses Toll5A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), with either full-length Spz1C proprotein or processed forms and Gram-negative bacteria for IMD pathway stimulation, as a positive control for a potent innate immune response.

We provide direct evidence of their interaction using purified proteins and show that ligand binding may be restricted by receptor self-association in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in conformational intermediates that we visualise by single particle cryo-EM.

We also note that duplicated Toll and Spz are more divergent in sequence than 1-to-1 orthologues, with Spz1 the only duplicated cytokine within its family, while duplication occurred for members of the Toll family including Toll1, Toll5 and Toll9 and expansion of the Toll6/7/8 family with two additional members, Toll10 and Toll11 with potential anti-plasmodial properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> diverged from <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, which is the main vector for malaria, about 217 Myr ago. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> efficiently vectors flaviviruses such as Dengue, as evident from the large number of non-retroviral integrated RNA viruses present in the <italic>A. aegypti</italic> but not the <italic>A gambiae</italic> genome.

In contrast, more divergent species from the <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> genera, which are not (or less) competent to vector these viruses, do not possess this paralog.

DmSpz1 is also able to bind promiscuously to Toll6 and Toll7 and so it may be that low affinity binding confers signalling specificity for Toll5A. Consistent with this idea the <italic>Aedes</italic> Spz5 paralog but not Spz1C activates the AMP gambicin in Aag2 cells as strongly as bacterial extracts while DmSpz1 induces a partial activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus <italic>A. aegypti</italic> has evolved a tiered Toll mediated immune system compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> where Toll1 alone fulfils most immune functions.</p><p id="P35">Low affinity ligand binding and its ramifications in terms of signalling has been extensively characterised for mammalian cytokine receptors for interferons and interleukin ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Such cytokines display pleiotropic effects while inducing a spectrum of redundant and yet distinct cellular functions. Receptor-ligand association and dissociation rates (kon and koff) have been found to be key in determining signalling outcomes. On-rates determine the amount of STAT transcription factor activation upon controlling the number of ligand-receptor complexes formed at the plasma membrane. In contrast, off-rates correlate to the kinetics of STAT activation depending on the half-life of ligand-receptor complexes. Alternatively, cell surface abundance of cytokine receptors plays a major role in triggering different transcriptional programs and cell fates, through obeying the mass action law and titrating cytokine concentrations. Our hypothesis in the case of <italic>Aedes</italic> Toll5A and Spz1C is that cell fate will be regimented in two ways depending on receptor and ligand concentrations: (i) ligand concentration changes the intensity of the signal (increased Spz1C for increased antimicrobial peptide production as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>); and (ii) increased receptor density might promote inhibitory self-association leading to immune quiescence.</p><p id="P36">The structures we present provide a plausible molecular explanation for negatively cooperative signalling. Binding of the first Spz1C homodimer to form the asymmetric complex can occur transiently at relatively low ligand concentrations but the 2:2 form would require saturation, and hence only form at saturating ligand concentrations. There are two classical theoretical models of sequential binding that lead to negatively cooperative receptor signalling as initially proposed by Koshland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Binding of the first monomeric ligand to a dimeric receptor partially activates signalling but full activation requires the less favourable binding of the second ligand monomer. In the second model, the binding of two monomeric ligands to form a 2:2 complex is required for signal transduction. The two models lead to somewhat different theoretical stimulus-response curves and our experiments appear to fit better with Model 1 for the production of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). If the ligand is limiting there is an ultrasensitive response with a pronounced threshold, more reminiscent of positive than negative cooperativity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In our cell culture assays, Spz1C is likely not limiting, however this phenomenon may be relevant for development and homeostasis controlled by Spz in the whole organism.</p><p id="P37">The activation profile of Spz1C differs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spz1 and <italic>Aedes</italic> Spz5, despite their shared cystine-knot fold, having a transcriptomic profile that indicates functions that go beyond immunity. Spz1C specifically activates the production of Hedgehog receptor, insect insulinbinding protein L2 and genes involved in reprogramming fatty acid metabolism. If Spz1C and Toll5A were both upregulated in the salivary glands, and achieved the double ligated state as suggested by Bonizzoni <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, it is also conceivable that Spz1C and its receptor could be involved in viral tolerance by promoting lipid metabolism and homeostasis. The mechanism of action may differ in the midgut where Spz1C expression is induced to limit viral invasion, an immunological role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. By contrast in the salivary gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, where Toll5A up-regulation may increase avidity for the ligand, a double ligated and hence fully saturated receptor complex might lead to a signal that differs from low density single-ligated receptors. Hence, future studies need to tackle the signalling capacities of 2:1 and 2:2 complexes by detecting the recruitment of MyD88 first, and if so, by checking if different sets of genes are controlled by both type of complexes. Fluorescence microscopy experiments will be best suited to detect such complexes along the presence of unliganded receptor homodimers to distinguish between these models.</p><p id="P38">Remarkably and despite a significantly lower affinity, Spz1C is as potent in stimulating mosquito Aag2 cells, as DmSpz is at stimulating <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. An alternative explanation is that cleavage of the Z-loop promotes stable ligand binding and thus processing might account for the discrepancy between protein affinity and cellular potency of Spz1C. On the other hand, Spz1C binding prevents cleavage of Toll5A of the Z-loop, a finding that is not consistent with the Z-loop impeding ligand binding. Additionally, we expressed Toll5A in insect cells without detecting such processing, which likely rules out its spontaneous occurrence. However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll1 can be cleaved at an equivalent residue, Asp 458 and forms a stable dimer with the ectodomain remaining intact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

Coverslips (24 × 50mm, No. 1.5H, Marienfeld) were cleaned by sequential sonication in Milli-Q water, isopropanol and Milli-Q-water, followed by drying with nitrogen. For each acquisition 2 <italic>μ</italic>L of protein solution was applied to 18 <italic>μ</italic>L PBS buffer, pH 7.4 in a gasket (CultureWellTM Reusable Gasket, Grace Bio-Labs) on a coverslip. Increasing working concentrations tested included 25, 50, 75 to 100 nM. Movies were recorded at 999 Hz with an exposure time of 0.95 ms by using the AcquireMP software. All mass photometry movies were processed and analysed in the DiscoverMP version 2.0 software.

Aliquots of 3 <bold>μ</bold>1 of between 3-6 mg/ml of Toll5A-Spz1C gel-filtered complex mixed with 8 mM CHAPSO (final concentration, Sigma) were applied to the grids, which were immediately blotted with filter paper once to remove any excess sample, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd) at 4 °C and 95 % humidity. All cryo-EM data presented were collected eBIC (Harwell, UK) and all data collection parameters are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

In short, CTF correction, motion correction, and particle picking were performed using Warp. These particles were subjected to two-dimensional (2D) classification in CryoSPARC followed by <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction to generate initial 3D models. Particles corresponding to different classes were selected and optimised through iterative rounds of heterogeneous refinement as implemented in CryoSPARC. The best models were then further refined using homogenous refinement and finally non-uniform refinement in CryoSPARC.

For Toll5A in the holo-dimer and the 3:1 trimer cryo-EM maps, the initial model for the receptor was taken from the apo-dimer refined structure, while Spz1C was the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spz homology model and the same strategy was applied.

Contaminating DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). The quantity and quality of RNA was checked using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher) and Bioanalyzer for RNA sequencing samples. Library preparation was performed with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Sample sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using mRNA derived from different conditions (Mock Aag2 cells and stimulated with 100nM of Spz1C, GNB and PGN). The reads obtained by RNA-seq were analysed using the Cufflinks RNA-Seq workflow against <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> genome on VectorBase (www.vectorbase.org). All graphic representations were made using CummeRbund package (v3.10) on R. RT-qPCR was conducted in a Rotor-Gene Q system (Qiagen) for over 40 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C, with each well containing 2 μl RNA (10 ng/μl), 0.8 μl 10 μM specific primers (final concentration, 300 nM), 5.4 μl H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 μl 20X Luna WarmStart RT Enzyme Mix (NEB) and 10 μl 2X Luna Universal One-step Reaction mix (NEB). Samples were measured in triplicates. Assessment of the expression of each target gene was based on relative quantification (RQ) using the comparative critical threshold (CT) value method. The RQ of a specific gene was evaluated in each reaction by normalization to the CT obtained for endogenous control gene <italic>elongation factor 1 alpha</italic> (eEF1a). Three independent infection experiments were conducted. The primers for quantitative RT-PCR used in this study are presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

For all experiments, expression values (Log2(FC)) were determined using the ΔΔCT method with normalisation to mRNA levels of the eEFG1a housekeeping gene. The dotted line indicates a value of Fold Change=2 as we determined to the limit to have change in expression profile. All Statistical analyses were performed in R using one-sided Student T-test or Kruskal–Wallis test (according to application condition of each after testing normality and equality of variances of each condition) to compare result versus a FC &gt;2 with significance p-value defined &gt; 0.05. Stars indicate significance: * = p-value&lt;0.05, ** = p-value&lt;0.01, and *** = p-value&lt;0.001.
