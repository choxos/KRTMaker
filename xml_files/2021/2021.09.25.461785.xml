Here we have developed LIGHTHOUSE, a graph-based deep learning approach for discovery of the hidden principles underlying the association of small-molecule compounds with target proteins. Without any 3D structural information for proteins or chemicals, LIGHTHOUSE estimates protein-compound scores that incorporate known evolutionary relations and available experimental data. It identified novel therapeutics for cancer, lifestyle-related disease, and bacterial infection. Moreover, LIGHTHOUSE predicted ethoxzolamide as a therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this agent was indeed effective against alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are rampant worldwide. We envision that LIGHTHOUSE will bring about a paradigm shift in translational medicine, providing a bridge from bench side to bedside.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>drug repurposing</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Despite enormous efforts to eradicate serious medical conditions such as cancer and infectious diseases, the translation of innovative research results into clinical practice progresses slowly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> leaving a large gap between bench side and bedside. The difficulty in identifying bioactive chemicals for a given target protein is one reason for this slow progress, with high-throughput screening (HTS) of a sufficiently diverse compound library being required for each target. About 10<sup>60</sup> natural compounds with a molecular mass of &lt;500 Da are thought to exist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> but HTS in most cases has been performed with only ~10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> compounds. Over the past few decades, molecular docking simulations have become widely adopted to reduce the cost, time, and effort required for HTS. This approach has been successful for some proteins whose crystal structures have been solved. More recently, with the advent of AlphaFold2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> the ability to predict protein structures has been greatly improved, but it remains difficult to identify pockets of proteins that are potential drug targets and drug discovery without three-dimensional (3D) structural information therefore remains a challenge. Given that high-resolution 3D structural data are not available for most proteins to date and the high computational requirements of molecular docking simulations, the application of this approach has been limited.</p><p id="P4">Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated its potential in the pharmaceutical industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Although many AI-based drug discovery methods have been proposed, they have had limited success in translational medicine. Whereas some studies have presented AI models with biological validation experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> many others have performed only computer-based validation without proof-of-concept biomedical experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> In addition, most platforms to date have been trained with small data sets, such as Directory of Useful Decoys Enhanced (DUD-E), that have known biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and are far from reflecting real-world data. Furthermore, many existing methods are based on a single network structure, whereas ensemble learning, which combines multiple network structures with different properties, might be expected to be more accurate and appropriate for AI-based drug discovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> As far as we are aware, no published study has described the discovery and validation of therapeutics for multiple human diseases based on the use of a single AI platform.</p><p id="P5">With this background, we have developed a new AI-based drug discovery platform, designated LIGHTHOUSE (Lead Identification with a GrapH-ensemble network for arbitrary Targets by Harnessing Only Underlying primary SEquence), an ensemble, end-to-end, graph-based deep learning tool that can predict chemicals able to interact with any protein of interest without 3D structural information. We have applied LIGHTHOUSE to malignant, infectious, and metabolic diseases. In addition, we show that LIGHTHOUSE successfully discovered a drug effective against wild-type and variant forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with this drug already having been approved for other purposes. We therefore believe that LIGHTHOUSE will promote drug discovery by identifying, from the vast chemical space, candidate compounds for a given protein with a reduced cost, time, and effort and with a wide range of potential biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LIGHTHOUSE predicts confidence and IC<sub>50</sub>-related scores for any protein-chemical pair</title><p id="P6">We developed an end-to-end framework that relies on a message passing neural network (MPNN) for compound embedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> to calculate scores for the association between any protein and any chemical. This chemical encoder takes simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) chemical encoding as input, considers the compounds as (mathematical) graph structures, and transforms them into low-dimensional vector representations. We adopted three different embedding methods for protein sequences: CNN (convolutional neural network),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Transformer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and AAC (amino acid composition up to 3-mers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> These methods take amino acid sequences and embed them in numerical vectors that take into account nearby (CNN) or distant (Transformer) sequences or physicochemical properties (AAC). The products of these chemical and protein encoding steps are then concatenated and entered into a feed-forward dense neural decoder network. Each chemical-protein pair is converted into a single score after this series of computations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We used this architecture to estimate both the confidence level for chemical-protein pairs and their median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values.</p><p id="P7">To train the platform to estimate confidence, we used ~1.3 million compound–(human) protein interactions (CPIs) stratify-sampled from STITCH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), which is one of the largest CPI databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and registers compound-protein pairs together with confidence scores. These scores are based on experimental data, evolutionary evidence such as homologous protein and compound relations, and co-occurrence frequencies in literature abstracts (scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the most reliable). To avoid overfitting, we randomly divided the overall data into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We fed the network with protein primary structures and chemicals and trained it to output the scores from the STITCH training data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). When we trained the three models (CNN, AAC, and Transformer for protein encoders) separately, the mean squared error (MSE) for the validation data was gradually decreased, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was also improved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B–1G</xref>). These findings indicated that our AI models learned the approximation of the hidden 1D relation underlying the compound-protein pairs without overfitting the training data. We examined the performance of the models with the test data set at the end of the training and (epoch-wise) validation phases, and we discovered that the AUROC for all three models was &gt;0.80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These scores are equivalent to or better than those of cutting-edge 3D docking simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> It is of note that our AI models can be applied to proteins for which 3D structural information is not available. We took the harmonic mean of the three scores to define the confidence score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We also trained the models to predict scores based on IC<sub>50</sub> values. For this purpose, we used data from BindingDB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> which collects a variety of experimental findings, and we divided the data into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). The same architecture was adopted to train the AI models to predict scaled IC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), yielding an interaction score, and we confirmed that the models adequately learned how to predict IC<sub>50</sub> from amino acid sequence–chemical pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B–2G</xref>). Finally, we assessed the performance of the models with undisclosed test data, finding that they performed well in predicting IC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LIGHTHOUSE architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods</title><p id="P10">We next compared the performance of LIGHTHOUSE with that of similar existing methods. To ensure a fair comparison, we used DUD-E data as were used in previous studies.<sup>7,19</sup> In brief, we randomly split DUD-E data (102 target proteins) into training (72 proteins) and test (30 proteins) data and then trained the LIGHTHOUSE architecture with the DUD-E training data for classification of compounds as active or decoy with regard to the protein in question. After this training, we examined LIGHTHOUSE performance with the DUD-E test data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Of note, we used only amino acid sequences of the proteins for training and evaluation of LIGHTHOUSE, even though DUD-E provides structural data (as PDB files) for proteins. In addition, we used the balanced data set of DUD-E—the training samples comprise 22,886 active (positive) and 22,886 decoy (negative) samples—as in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> LIGHTHOUSE yielded an AUROC for the DUD-E test data of 0.956 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>), which was higher than the values produced by state-of-the-art methods including 3D-CNN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> AtomNet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and a graph-based deep learning method proposed by Tsubaki et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For further comparison of LIGHTHOUSE with the second best method, we downloaded CPI data for human and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> from the Github repository of Tsubaki et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Both of these data sets were generated previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Similar to Tsubaki et al., we retrained the LIGHTHOUSE architecture with these training data, and we found that LIGHTHOUSE outperformed this other method on the basis of both AUROC and F1 metrics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These bodies of evidence thus show that LIGHTHOUSE is one of the best architectures for drug discovery available to date.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In silico</italic> verification of LIGHTHOUSE</title><p id="P12">We next evaluated the performance of LIGHTHOUSE in terms of its ability to predict known CPIs. We generated two data sets for this purpose: a “Positive” data set consisting of reliable CPIs (STITCH confidence score of &gt;0.9), and a “Negative” data set in which the amino acid sequences of the “Positive” data set were inverted so that they would no longer be expected to interact with the corresponding chemicals. Calculation by LIGHTHOUSE of the confidence scores for both data sets revealed that those for the “Positive” data set were heavily skewed toward 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the two data sets could be distinguished on the basis of their LIGHTHOUSE confidence scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given that the STITCH database used for the training of LIGHTHOUSE relies not only on experimental CPI data but also on co-appearance of chemicals and proteins in the literature, some well-studied molecules, such as ATP, have high values even in the “Negative” data set. Despite the presence of such false positives, LIGHTHOUSE proved to be effective in predicting the degree of association between protein-chemical pairs solely on the basis of protein primary structure.</p><p id="P13">We next validated the effectiveness of LIGHTHOUSE for well-studied compound-protein pairs. LIGHTHOUSE yielded high confidence scores for adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3) and epinephrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Histamine receptors are classified into four subtypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> with HRH1 and HRH2 being targets of antiallergy and antiulcer drugs, respectively. LIGHTHOUSE predicted that the HRH1 antagonist fexofenadine would associate to a greater extent with HRH1 than with HRH2, whereas the HRH2 inhibitor famotidine would associate to a greater extent with HRH2 than with HRH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggested that LIGHTHOUSE is able to accurately discriminate receptor subtype–level differences solely on the basis of amino acid sequences.</p><p id="P14">LIGHTHOUSE also proved informative both for macrocyclic chemicals such as rapamycin, yielding a high confidence score for this drug and mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), as well as for peptide drugs such as bortezomib (used for treatment of multiple myeloma), leuprorelin (hormone-responsive cancers), and semaglutide (type 2 diabetes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), yielding high confidence scores for these drugs and their known targets: proteasome subunit PSMB1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and glucagon-like peptide–1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP1R),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> respectively. Given the rapidly growing demand for peptide drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> LIGHTHOUSE will prove useful for the development of novel peptide therapeutics for a variety of promising targets.</p><p id="P15">We also applied LIGHTHOUSE to five drugs that were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020 but which had not yet been registered in the STITCH database. LIGHTHOUSE successfully predicted the association between these new drugs and their target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), indicating the expandability of LIGHTHOUSE to a much larger exploration space than that encompassed by STITCH.</p><p id="P16">Furthermore, we also evaluated IC<sub>50</sub> data from BindingDB, which is derived from actual bioassays. We found that the predicted value and observed value correlate well in the BindingDB test data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This series of findings thus demonstrated the ability of LIGHTHOUSE to discover new drugs for a broad spectrum of diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LIGHTHOUSE discovers an inhibitor of PPAT, a key metabolic enzyme for cancer treatment</title><p id="P17">We investigated whether LIGHTHOUSE can identify compounds for novel and potentially important therapeutic targets. As such a target, we chose phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), a rate-limiting enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotide synthesis pathway, given that its expression is most correlated among all metabolic enzymes with poor prognosis in various human cancers and that its depletion markedly inhibits tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Although no PPAT inhibitor has been developed and the 3D structure of the protein has not been solved, we attempted to discover an inhibitor for PPAT by LIGHTHOUSE solely on the basis of its amino acid sequence. We virtually screened ~10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> commercially available compounds in the ZINC database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). To reduce the calculation time, we adopted a step-by-step application of LIGHTHOUSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The MPNN_CNN model excluded most of the chemicals unrelated to PPAT, with only 2.41% of the starting compounds having a score of &gt;0.5 in this initial screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The selected compounds were then processed by the MPNN_AAC and MPNN_Transformer models, which reduced the number of candidate chemicals to 0.0356% of the initial compounds. We also calculated interaction scores by LIGHTHOUSE and visualized them in a 2D plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, left). The best candidates would be expected to have high confidence and interaction scores, appearing in the upper right corner of the plot. Indeed, this criterion was met by several well-known drug-target combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, right).</p><p id="P18">Among the &gt;333,000 final compounds, the top candidate PPAT inhibitor with the highest confidence score was ZINC8551105 (riboflavin 5’-monophosphate), with a predicted IC<sub>50</sub> of 1 to 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We performed a biochemical assay to test this prediction and found that riboflavin 5’-monophosphate indeed markedly inhibited PPAT activity with an actual IC<sub>50</sub> of 7.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). This compound, discovered by LIGHTHOUSE solely on the basis of the PPAT amino acid sequence, is thus a potential lead compound for the development of new therapeutics targeted to a variety of cancers. It is also of note that we tested only this compound, so other top candidates might also inhibit PPAT activity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>LIGHTHOUSE identifies an inhibitor of drug-resistant bacterial growth</title><p id="P19">Bacterial infections pose a clinical problem worldwide, especially in developing countries, and the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains as a result of the overuse of antibiotics has exacerbated this problem. β-Lactamase enzymes produced by antibiotic-resistant bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> target the β-lactam ring of antibiotics of the penicillin family. We therefore applied LIGHTHOUSE to search for antibiotics not dependent on β-lactam structure.</p><p id="P20">LIGHTHOUSE predicted that pyridoxal 5’-phosphate might associate with penicillin binding proteins such as PBP2 <italic>(mrdA)</italic>, PBP3 <italic>(ftsI)</italic>, and PBP5 <italic>(dacA)</italic>, all of which are essential for cell wall synthesis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Furthermore, LIGHTHOUSE predicted that removal of the phosphate group would reduce the inhibitory potency of riboflavin 5’-monophosphate for PPAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), and this prediction was confirmed correct by the finding that the IC<sub>50</sub> value was increased from 7.5 to 49.9 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggested the possibility that LIGHTHOUSE is capable of predicting activity cliffs.</p><p id="P22">LIGHTHOUSE is also able to estimate the effect of point mutations on CPIs.

LIGHTHOUSE is able to provide such insight from only wild-type amino acid sequences, given the lack of variant information in the original training data set. Our results suggest that LIGHTHOUSE is able to predict the effects of small changes in protein or chemical structure, and that this will be the case even if such variants do not exist in nature.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>LIGHTHOUSE identifies potential on- and off-targets of given compounds</title><p id="P23">Opposite to the mode of drug discovery for a given protein, LIGHTHOUSE might also be able to identify proteins as potential on- or off-targets for a given compound. To verify this notion, we examined statins, which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors widely administered for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Epidemiological studies have shown that statins not only lower cholesterol, however, but also have effects on cancer, although the target molecules for these effects have remained unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> We therefore applied LIGHTHOUSE to three representative statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and fluvastatin) and computed confidence scores for all human protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We then sorted the genes on the basis of these confidence scores and performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis for the top 500 potential statin targets.

We calculated scores for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is targeted by SARS-CoV-2 for infection of host cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and the top drug candidate, ethoxzolamide, was selected for validation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Immunocytofluorescence analysis revealed that ethoxzolamide blocks proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Furthermore, ethoxzolamide was effective against not only the wild-type virus but also the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. It thus rescued virus-challenged cells in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting noninfected cells (median cytotoxicity concentration &gt; 50 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D and 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 6</xref>), and it reduced the virus load present in the culture supernatant of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F and 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).

We tested another 11 drugs and found another 2 compounds that also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). This high hit rate of 25% (3 hits in 12 compounds) shows the potential power of LIGHTHOUSE for drug repositioning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Although recent advances in biological and medical research have uncovered various proteins as promising therapeutic targets in a variety of diseases, the clinical application of these research findings has been limited because of the difficulty in identifying therapeutic chemicals for these targets in a cost-effective and high-throughput manner. Acquisition of 3D structural data for target proteins has been labor-intensive, and processing of such data requires a huge amount of computer capacity and time, resulting in a delay in the translation of research findings from the laboratory to the clinic. We have now shown that LIGHTHOUSE facilitates the identification, from a vast chemical space, of candidate compounds for given target proteins solely on the basis of the primary structure of these proteins. Furthermore, the AUROC for LIGHTHOUSE is equivalent to or better than that for state-of-the-art 3D docking simulation methods as well as for other AI methodologies.</p><p id="P27">We have applied LIGHTHOUSE to attractive targets for various diseases, including cancer, bacterial infection, metabolic diseases, and COVID-19, with some of the suggested chemicals being determined experimentally to be effective for inhibition of the corresponding targets. The actual targets of identified compounds require further biological investigation, especially in the case of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate and PBPs. As for ethoxzolamide, we attempted to obtain clinical evidence in support of its effectiveness against COVID-19. However, ethoxzolamide is an old drug and is essentially no longer prescribed as a result of the development of more potent agents such as acetazolamide. We were therefore not able to find data to address whether COVID-19 patients taking ethoxzolamide have a better clinical outcome.</p><p id="P28">The hit compounds themselves identified in the present study are not sufficient for immediate clinical use. LIGHTHOUSE can be applied not only for the identification of lead compounds but also for their subsequent optimization, which requires extensive work to identify more potent and specific or less toxic derivatives. One promising method to support such optimization is to apply LIGHTHOUSE and either reinforcement learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) or Metropolis-Hasting (MH) approaches together. Virtual libraries can be generated from identified lead compounds in an intensive manner with the use of sophisticated chemoinformatics algorithms such as RECAP (Retrosynthetic Combinatorial Analysis Procedure).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> LIGHTHOUSE can score the generated virtual compounds and help to narrow down the candidates with better scores than the original hit compound. Select candidates can then be synthesized in collaboration with organic chemists and their effects tested. Given the recent success of the MH approach in various life science fields,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> LIGHTHOUSE should be able to facilitate the optimization of drug candidates by iterating these steps.</p><p id="P29">The biggest limitation of LIGHTHOUSE is the generation of false positives, which is due in part to the fact that the confidence score provided by STITCH is not based solely on experimental data but also on other factors such as co-occurrence in the literature. This confidence score therefore does not necessarily reflect actual interaction for a given protein-chemical pair, and well-studied molecules are thus prone to score higher than others. On the other hand, low confidence scores do not necessarily mean that the protein and chemical in question do not interact. We modeled this score because current biologically determined CPI data sets contain fewer CPI pairs. In addition, as a result of publication bias and biological experimental conditions, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether a protein and chemical do not interact, whether they did not bind under the specific assay condition, or whether they were not tested. This drawback of LIGHTHOUSE can be mitigated partially by combining the three different models (CNN, AAC, and Transformer). It may also be important to perform a counter–virtual screening to determine whether an identified small molecule reacts specifically with the target protein or whether it scores highly with many proteins. Such an approach has the potential to reduce the number of false positives and provide more accurate guidance. Furthermore, we also modeled IC<sub>50</sub> data from BindingDB, which is derived from actual bioassays. We found that the predicted value and observed value correlate well in the BindingDB test data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). By combining the confidence score (from STITCH) and the interaction score (from BindingDB) provided by LIGHTHOUSE, we were able to discover a clinically approved drug that was able to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P30">Another potential limitation is that the performance for STITCH data might be overestimated because we downsampled the original imbalanced data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). There are several ways to tackle imbalanced data, including downsampling, oversampling, and more complex sampling methods such as SMOTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> Each of these approaches has potential limitations, however.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> In the present study, we adopted downsampling, as in a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> so the performance for STITCH data may be overestimated when compared with use of the entire STITCH data.</p><p id="P31">Despite these limitations, LIGHTHOUSE proved to be effective for the identification of lead compounds for all conditions tested. It can theoretically be applied to any protein of any organism, and even to proteins that do not exist naturally. This is an advantage over 3D docking simulation methods, which require prior 3D structural knowledge of the protein of interest. LIGHTHOUSE computes and embeds structural information in numerical vectors, which are then readily retrieved by the subsequent decoding module. Given the accelerating development of protein embedding technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and graph-based chemoinformatics approaches, LIGHTHOUSE has the potential to be a cornerstone of drug discovery. It is also of note that we split the STITCH data set once, given that a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> showed it could obtain high performance with a relatively small range of hyperparameter tuning. In-depth hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation may further boost the performance of the model.</p><p id="P32">The next step for more sophisticated AI-dependent drug discovery and its clinical application will be the use of huge-scale and robust protein-chemical binding (and nonbinding) data, with the recent introduction of academic journals that specialize in big data reflecting the growth of this field. Moreover, development of improved approaches to the handling of imbalanced data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> is another active research field in computer science. These advances in both data and methodology should allow more reliable modeling of physical interactions and further facilitate drug discovery in the coming years.</p><p id="P33">In summary, we have developed LIGHTHOUSE as a means to discover promising lead compounds for any target protein irrespective of its 3D structural information. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the power of LIGHTHOUSE by identifying and validating novel therapeutics for various global health concerns including COVID-19. LIGHTHOUSE will serve as a guide for researchers in all areas of biomedicine, paving the way for a wide range of future applications.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S13"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S14"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P34">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Keiichi I.

1</label><caption><title>Development of LIGHTHOUSE for discovery of drug candidates without 3D structural data</title><p>(A) The basic network structure of LIGHTHOUSE consists of encoder and decoder networks. The basic network encodes the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest as numerical vectors by one of three independent methods: CNN, AAC, and Transformer. It also takes the SMILES representation of each small-molecule compound and computes the neural representation with the MPNN algorithm. The network then concatenates the protein and compound representations and calculates a “Score.” (B and C) LIGHTHOUSE consists of two modules. Module 1 estimates the association between a given compound-protein pair, and module 2 predicts a scaled IC<sub>50</sub> value for the pair. In each module, the three different streams of the basic network (MPNN_CNN, MPNN_AAC, and MPNN_Transformer) are used, and the harmonic mean of the three scores is presented as the final ensemble score. Each of the three streams in module 1 (B) is trained to minimize the error between the predicted “Score” and the score registered in the STITCH database, which contains millions of known and estimated CPIs. The higher the confidence score (closer to 1), the more confident LIGHTHOUSE is that there is some relation between the compound and the protein; conversely, the lower the confidence score (closer to 0), the more confident LIGHTHOUSE is that there is no such relation. Each of the three streams in module 2 (C) is trained to predict scaled IC<sub>50</sub> values with the use of BindingDB data. For instance, an interaction score of 4 means that, if the compound has inhibitory activity, the IC<sub>50</sub> would be ~100 μM, whereas an interaction score of 9 means that, if the compound has inhibitory activity, the IC<sub>50</sub> would be ~1 nM. Note that module 2 only works if the compound and protein interact, so this module is auxiliary to module 1.

Proteins in the “Negative” data set would not be expected to interact with the corresponding compounds.</p><p>LIGHTHOUSE tended to yield higher confidence scores for CPIs in the “Positive” data set, with the exception of the rightmost peak for the “Negative” data set, presumably because these chemicals (such as ATP) are well known and frequently mentioned in the PubMed literature.
