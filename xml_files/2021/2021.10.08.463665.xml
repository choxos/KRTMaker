<abstract>
<p id="P1">Extrapulmonary complications of different organ systems have been increasingly recognized in patients with severe or chronic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, limited information on the skeletal complications of COVID-19 is known, even though inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract have been known to perturb bone metabolism and cause pathological bone loss. In this study, we characterized the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on bone metabolism in an established golden Syrian hamster model for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 causes significant multifocal loss of bone trabeculae in the long bones and lumbar vertebrae of all infected hamsters. The bone loss progressively worsens from the acute phase to the post-recovery phase. Mechanistically, the bone loss was associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine dysregulation which upregulates osteoclastic differentiation of monocyte-macrophage lineage. The pro-inflammatory cytokines further trigger a second wave of cytokine storm in the skeletal tissues to augment their pro-osteoclastogenesis effect. Our findings in this established hamster model suggest that pathological bone loss may be a neglected complication which warrants more extensive investigations during the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The benefits of potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against pathological bone loss should be further evaluated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused nearly 216 million cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and nearly 4.5 million deaths as of 29 August 2021 since the virus’ discovery in December 2019 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Severe acute COVID-19 may be complicated by both pulmonary (pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure) and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as anosmia, ageusia, diarrhea, lymphopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. More recently, it has been increasingly recognized that some patients may develop long-term complications and persistent symptoms of COVID-19, such as fatigue, headache, dyspnea, anosmia, muscle weakness, low-grade fever, and cognitive dysfunction <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. However, the full spectrum of clinical manifestations in the long-term post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or “long COVID”, remains incompletely understood. In particular, SARS-CoV-2-associated pathological changes of the skeletal system remain largely unknown.</p>
<p id="P4">Recently, a multi-centre study showed that COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care had significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) than those who were managed in the non-intensive care setting <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Another clinical study found that the number of severe clinical incidence was significantly higher in patients with lower BMD compared to those with higher BMD, therefore vertebral BMD is a strong independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. In addition, about 24% of long COVID patients reported bone ache or burning, with the symptoms lasting for up to 7 months after the onset of COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Despite these emerging evidence on long-term complications of COVID-19, very limited serial investigations have been conducted on skeletal system involvement in the post-recovery phase. This is not unexpected because in COVID-19, patients either succumb or recover from the acute phase. In patients who recover from COVID-19, the focus on follow-up is usually limited to the respiratory, cardiac, and neurological functions which are well reported in the literature, rather than skeletal pathologies which typically do not manifest in the acute phase and therefore may be neglected. Moreover, since severe COVID-19 is most often found in elderly patients and those with comorbidities including patients those on chronic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs, the virus-induced bone changes in these patients who may already have osteoporosis before the infection may not be appreciated.</p>
<p id="P5">The skeletal system undergoes continuous bone formation and degradation throughout life and this tightly regulated remodelling process could be disturbed by many factors, particularly metabolic alterations and hormonal changes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. An imbalance between bone formation and resorption can also result from various chronic inflammatory diseases, leading to systemic osteoporosis and increased fracture risk <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. For instance, chronic pulmonary inflammation arising from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and asthma are reported to induce systemic bone loss <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, it has been shown that the extent of local or systemic osteopenia is associated with the degree of inflammatory response and the inflammation-induced bone loss can continue after effective therapeutic intervention on the inflammatory disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Severe COVID-19 patients developed much higher serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-1β, IFN-α, IL-1RA and IL-8) than the other ones, indicating that the inflammatory storm was closely correlated with disease severity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to not only perpetuate the inflammation to impair lung function, but also perturb bone metabolism, leading to bone resorption <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. A recent radiological study on COVID-19 survivors with persisting symptoms for up to three months after discharge revealed that the inflammation in bone marrow persisted after recovery <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, reactive hemophagocytosis mediated by cytokine storm-induced activation of macrophage was common in deceased COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that in addition to other reported extrapulmonary manifestations, the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 may also contribute to pathological changes in the skeletal system <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we characterized the previously unreported effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on bone metabolism during the acute and post-recovery phases in our established golden Syrian hamster model which closely mimics human infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, we identified inflammation-induced osteoclastic activation as the underlying mechanism mediating the pathological bone loss. The findings of this study highlight the need for optimizing clinical protocols for monitoring long-term complications of COVID-19 and finding novel treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory osteopenia / osteoporosis.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 causes significant loss of bone trabeculae</title>
<p id="P7">To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on bone metabolism, we utilized our established golden Syrian hamster model, which recapitulates the clinical, virological, immunological, and pathological features of COVID-19 in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a &amp; 1b</xref>). In this hamster model, the most prominent disease manifestations are seen at about 4 days post-infection (dpi) and the hamsters generally recover at about 7 to 10 dpi. As shown in our three-dimensional micro computerized tomography (μCT) scans, SARS-CoV-2-infected but not PBS-challenged mock-infected control hamsters exhibited progressive loss of bone trabeculae at the distal metaphysis of femurs from the acute phase (4 dpi) to the post-recovery phase (30 dpi) and chronic phase (60 dpi) of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). A significant decrease in the thickness of trabeculae was detected at as early as 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Quantitatively, dramatic reductions (up to 50%) in trabecular bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and polar moment of inertia were seen at 30 dpi. There was also significant decrease in bone mineral density and trabecular thickness, as well as significant increase in the specific bone surface and trabecular pattern factor at 30 dpi. The bone volume and density then remained static from 30 dpi to 60 dpi. To verify our μCT scan findings, we examined the histological changes of the femurs of SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 1a</bold>), which demonstrated that the reduction in bone trabeculae structures at the distal metaphysis of femur was evident at both 30 dpi and 60 dpi in the SARS-CoV-2-infected but not mock-infected hamsters.</p>
<p id="P8">Next, we investigated whether similar changes were seen in other sites. Both the μCT scan data and histological analysis showed that there was also significant decrease in bone trabeculae at the proximal metaphysis of tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a to 2c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 1a</bold>). The trabecular bone volume of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at 30 dpi and 60 dpi was only about 50% of that of the mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Corroboratively, there was decreased bone mineral density and trabecular number, and increased trabecular pattern factor at 30 dpi and 60 dpi. In contrast, the changes in trabecular bone thickness, polar moment of inertia, and specific bone surface were evident at as early as 4 dpi. Similar to our findings in the femur, the bone structures remained relatively static between 30 dpi and 60 dpi. The same pattern of bone loss with significant reduction in trabecular bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, and higher specific bone surface and trabecular pattern factor were observed also in the lumbar vertebrae at 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d &amp; 2e</xref>). Overall, these findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant bone loss at different sites of the skeleton in the hamster model.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 activates osteoclastogenesis in hamsters</title>
<p id="P9">To provide mechanistic insights into the dysregulated bone metabolism in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, we asked whether the bone loss is primarily caused by an alteration in bone resorption or bone formation. Compared with mock-infected hamsters, a significantly higher number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>) osteoclasts were found in the bone trabeculae at the distal metaphysis of the femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), the proximal metaphysis of the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and the lumbar vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. The number of TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts at the distal metaphysis of the femur of the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at 4 dpi and 30 dpi was almost double of that of the mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated significantly more TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts expressing nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) at the bone surface of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The increased intensity of TRAP and NFATc1 at the distal metaphysis of femur at 4 dpi indicated that the osteoclastic activity was upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). We also compared the expression of NFATc1, TRAP, cathepsin K, and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) in the bone tissues using western blotting, showing these osteoclastic markers are upregulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 1b &amp;1c).</bold> In contrast, ALP staining (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 2a</bold>) and immunofluorescence staining for osteocalcin (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 2b</bold>) showed that there was no significant difference in the osteoblastic activities between the SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected hamsters at 4 dpi.</p>
<p id="P10">We next determined the expression of various osteoclastogenesis-related genes in the bone tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Compared with mock-infected hamsters, the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (<italic>RANKL</italic>), which is essential for the osteoclastic differentiation, was tripled in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Moreover, several osteoclastic marker genes contributing to the formation and activity of osteoclasts, including receptor activator of NF-κB (<italic>RANK</italic>), cathepsin K (<italic>CTSK</italic>), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (<italic>MMP-9</italic>), and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (<italic>CSF1R</italic>), were significantly upregulated in the bone tissues after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The expression of osteoprotegerin (<italic>OPG</italic>), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL to inhibit RANK-RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, was correspondingly significantly downregulated after the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition to the increased number of TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts, we further found significant higher number of osteoclast progenitors, including CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and RANK<sup>+</sup> preosteoclasts, in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b &amp; 4c</xref>). There were more multinuclear cells located at the bone trabeculae co-expressing TRAP and CD68 in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Using multiplex immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, we further identified this lineage of TRAP<sup>+</sup>RANK<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts upregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection to be expressing a higher level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) than the ones seen in the mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, to further elucidate the underlying mechanism, we then examined the expression of genes related to IL-1β signaling. Compared with the mock-infected hamsters, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters exhibited significant upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor type I (<italic>IL-1RI</italic>), but not interleukin-1 receptor type II (<italic>IL-1RII</italic>). Interestingly, the expression of IL-1β in the bone tissue was not significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced a two-fold increase in the expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (<italic>IL-1RA</italic>) in bone tissue. Taken together, these findings indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the activation of osteoclastic cascade resulting in the destruction of trabeculae structure in both long bones and axial skeleton.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 disturbs inflammatory microenvironment in skeleton system without direct infection</title>
<p id="P11">Having demonstrated the involvement of the local immune response in pathological osteoclastogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we next asked whether the inflammatory bone loss was also caused by direct infection of the bone tissues by SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) in co-localized angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells were evident throughout the respiratory tract, from the nasal turbinate to the trachea and pulmonary alveoli at 4 dpi (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 3</bold>). CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages engulfing SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which co-expressed viral NP and ACE2, were also observed, indicating active immune response in the areas. In stark contrast, despite the presence of ACE2 in some of the immune cells residing in bone tissues, viral NP was absent in the periosteum, bone trabeculae, and synovium of the femoral bone tissue in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, viral RNA was not detected in the bone tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These findings indicated that the bone tissues were not directly infected by SARS-CoV-2. We then investigated whether the osteoclastogenesis was associated with the virus-induced inflammatory response. Our ELISA results showed that the mean serum IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 protein levels were all higher in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters than that of the mock-infected hamsters, with the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α reaching statistical significance (P&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Interestingly, while direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of bone tissue was absent, the expression of interferon-gamma (<italic>IFN-</italic>γ) and its downstream signals, including interferon regulatory factor 1 (<italic>IRF1</italic>) and interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2), were significantly upregulated in the bone tissue of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The expression of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (<italic>IFIT3</italic>) was only marginally increased. Compared with the mock control, the inflammation-related genes upregulated in bone tissue in response to the respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 include C-C motif chemokine 22 (<italic>CCL22</italic>), interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (<italic>IL-2RA</italic>), <italic>TNF-</italic>α, colony stimulating factor 1 (<italic>CSF1</italic>), and colony stimulating factor 2 (<italic>CSF2</italic>), nevertheless, the expression of C-C motif chemokine 17 (<italic>CCL17</italic>), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (<italic>CXCL10</italic>), and interleukin 12 p40 (<italic>IL12p40</italic>) remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d &amp; 5e</xref>). Additionally, it is noteworthy that the infection in the respiratory system intriguingly downregulated the expression of interferon-beta (<italic>IFN-</italic>β), interleukin 21 (<italic>IL-21</italic>), and interleukin 6 (<italic>IL-6</italic>) in bone tissue, which are vital for the clearance of virus infection.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory cytokines upregulate osteoclastogenesis</title>
<p id="P13">To address whether the bone loss subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection was caused by the pro-inflammatory cytokines that originate from the respiratory system, we first compared the expression of various inflammatory cytokines in the bone tissue of SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected hamsters. Using immunofluorescence staining, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection contributed to a significant increase in the levels of IL-1β, IL-1RA, and TNF-α, as well as a marginal increase in the level of IFN-γ in bone tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a to 6d</xref>). These changes were confirmed by Western blot which demonstrated a more than six-fold increase of IL-1β, a seven-fold increase of TNF-α, and a three-fold increase of IL-1RA in bone tissue at 4 dpi in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters than the mock-infected hamsters (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 4a &amp; 4b</bold>). Additionally, immunofluorescence staining showed the co-expression of these inflammatory cytokines with CD68, the bone resident macrophage marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a to 6d</xref>). More importantly, we showed that the expression of NF-κB, the key transcription factor in inflammatory responses, was significantly higher at the bone surface of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters than that of the mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Semi-quantification by both immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting showed that the level of NF-κB in the bone tissue was doubled in the bone tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters than the mock-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 4a &amp; 4b</bold>).</p>
<p id="P14">To further confirm the effects of these inflammatory cytokines on osteoclastic activities in bone tissue, we conducted a series of experiments using mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) isolated from young (three-month-old) or adult (six-month-old) mice. First, we tested the response of murine BMM to the stimulation of IL-1β as our data had shown the activation of the IL-1β signaling cascade in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The presence of recombinant murine IL-1β contributed to a two-fold increase in the number of TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinuclear cells derived from BMM isolated from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a &amp; 7b</xref>). When added to BMMs isolated from adult mice, IL-1β led to a doubled size of fused osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a &amp; 7b</xref>). In contrast, the addition of IL-1β neutralizing antibody (Neu-Abs) not only reduced the number of BMMs-derived osteoclasts, but also resulted in a smaller size of osteoclasts differentiated from adult mouse BMMs. Meanwhile, the expression of <italic>IL-1R1</italic> was increased by six times in the young BMMs and four times in the adult BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). However, the effect of Neu-Abs on the downregulation of <italic>IL-1R1</italic> was only significant in BMMs from young mice, but not the ones from adult mice. Nevertheless, the gene expression of <italic>IL-1RA</italic>, which encodes interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, was significantly upregulated in both young and adult BMMs in response to the stimulation of IL-1β and downregulated after the addition of Neu-Abs.</p>
<p id="P15">Besides the direct effect of IL-1β on BMMs, we further tested whether IL-1β could promote osteoclastogenesis through the regulation of the osteoblast lineage. The indirect co-culture of BMMs and MSC was achieved using a transwell assay. IL-1β led to significant increase in the size of BMM-derived osteoclasts after their co-culture with IL-1β-treated MSC, even though the number of TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinuclear cells remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d &amp;7e</xref>). Neu-Abs-treated MSC, instead, decreased the average size of osteoclast derived from young or adult BMMs. This might be explained by the changes in the pro-osteoclastogenesis cytokines produced by MSCs, as IL-1β contributed to a two-fold increase in the expression of <italic>RANKL</italic> without changing the level of <italic>OPG</italic> in MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Neither IL-1β nor its neutralizing antibody significantly regulated the expression of <italic>CSF1</italic> in MSC.</p>
<p id="P16">The effects of IL-1β and its neutralizing antibody on osteoclastogenesis were further confirmed using Western blotting. In both osteoclasts derived from BMM of young mice and that of adult mice, the expressions of NFATc1, NF-κB p65, and CTSK were significantly upregulated by recombinant murine IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Additionally, Neu-Abs suppressed the pro-osteoclastogenesis effects of IL-1β, as it downregulated the expression of NFATc1, NF-κB p65, and CTSK in BMM-derived osteoclasts from young and adult mice. Moreover, the Neu-Abs inhibited the IL-1β induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 4c</bold>). Similar to the direct effect of IL-1β on osteoclastogenesis, IL-1β-treated MSC also led to a significant upregulation in the expression of NFATc1 and the phosphorylation of JNK, which were both significantly downregulated by Neu-Abs-treated MSC (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 5a</bold>). Although IL-1β-treated MSC only contributed to a marginal increase in the expression of NF-κB p65 and CTSK in BMM, Neu-Abs-treated MSC significantly inhibited both of them (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 5a</bold>).</p>

<title>The second wave of cytokine storm promotes pathological bone resorption</title>
<p id="P17">Since our results have verified the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in bone tissue, we hypothesized the prominent inflammatory response in bone tissue was related to the systemic cytokine storm that originates from the respiratory system after viral infection. Therefore, in addition to the pro-osteoclastogenesis effect of IL-1β, we also explored the immunomodulatory effects of IL-1β and its neutralizing antibody on BMM isolated from young and adult mice. The recombinant murine IL-1β contributed to an approximately 6-fold increase in the expression of <italic>COX2</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>), which are both involved in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The presence of Neu-Abs inhibited the increase in the expression of <italic>COX2</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic> induced by IL-1β. The pro-inflammatory effect of IL-1β can also be manifested by the significant changes in the expression of various inflammation-related genes. For instance, in BMM isolated from young mice, IL-1β led to a more than 80-fold increase in <italic>IFN-</italic>γ expression and an around 2-fold increase in <italic>TNF-</italic>α expression, as well as a 5-fold increase in <italic>IL-6</italic> expression. In contrast, the expressions of <italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>IL-23</italic> were significantly downregulated by IL-1β, with the expression of IL-22 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data 5b</bold>). In BMM isolated from adult mice, IL-1β also contributed to a 60-fold increase in <italic>IFN-</italic>γ expression, an approximately 1.75-fold increase in <italic>TNF-</italic>α expression, an around 4-fold increase in <italic>IL-6</italic> expression, and a less than 1.5-fold increase in <italic>IL-22</italic> expression. However, the expression of <italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>IL-23</italic> were not significantly altered by the addition of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data 5b</bold>). In BMM from both young and adult mice, the addition of Neu-Abs abolished the upregulation in the expression of <italic>IFN-</italic>γ, <italic>TNF-</italic>α, and <italic>IL-6</italic> caused by IL-1β. In BMM from young mice, Neu-Abs resulted in significant upregulation in the expression of <italic>IL-10</italic>, <italic>IL-22</italic>, and <italic>IL-23</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data 5b</bold>).</p>
<p id="P18">We then asked whether the pro-inflammatory cytokines from the systemic cytokine storm subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the activated macrophages in bone tissue synergistically promoted osteoclastogenesis. First, we showed that recombinant murine TNF-α and IFN-γ exaggerated the effects of IL-1β through the upregulation of <italic>IL-1R1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). This phenomenon was more prominent in BMM isolated from adult mice, as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ together led to an around 20-fold increase in the expression of <italic>IL-1R1</italic>, while IL-1β alone only upregulated <italic>IL-1R1</italic> by 5-fold. As a result, two major marker genes (i.e., <italic>MMP9</italic> and <italic>CTSK</italic>) for osteoclastic activities were found to be further upregulated when the three inflammatory cytokines were administered in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). In BMM isolated from young mice, the addition of TNF-α and IFN-γ to IL-1β resulted in a 4-fold increase in <italic>MMP9</italic> expression, when IL-1β alone failed to induce higher <italic>MMP9</italic> expression than the control. Meanwhile, in BMM isolated from adult mice, the combination of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ led to a more than 7-fold increase in the expression of <italic>MMP9</italic> and a 1.5-fold increase in the expression of <italic>CTSK</italic>, while IL-1β alone did not significantly alter the expression of these two osteoclastic marker genes. Notably, the three inflammatory cytokines synergistically contributed to a more than 60-fold increase in the expression of Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (<italic>NOS2</italic>), when IL-1β alone only upregulated <italic>NOS2</italic> expression by less than 30 times. Together, these findings indicate that the pro-inflammatory cytokines synergistically contribute to pathological bone resorption.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">In addition to respiratory tract manifestations, extrapulmonary manifestations are also commonly reported in severe coronavirus infections such as COVID-19, SARS, and MERS <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Based on the phylogenetic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it has been postulated that the two betacoronaviruses may cause similar clinical features in infected patients. However, recent evidence has increasingly shown that there are more musculoskeletal sequelae associated with COVID-19 than SARS <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. The most severe musculoskeletal complication in SARS patients was non-progressive avascular necrosis of the femoral head caused by high-dose steroid pulse therapy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, musculoskeletal sequelae have been increasingly reported in severe COVID-19 patients including those who have recovered from the acute phase of the infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. In this study, using an established hamster model, we demonstrated significant bone resorption at the acute inflammatory stage after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in addition to a significantly increased number of RANK<sup>+</sup> osteoclast precursors at this stage <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, there were also more TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts expressing NFATc1, which is known to serve as a master regulator for terminal differentiation of osteoclasts <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. This implies that pathological bone destruction may happen quickly after the onset of COVID-19. More importantly, similar findings were evident in different bone tissues harvested from the hamsters, suggesting that the bone loss is not site-specific but systemic. Without proper intervention, the bone volume and bone mineral density were barely restored even after the viral load became undetectable at the post-recovery / chronic inflammatory phase. The presence of pathological bone loss may in turn complicate the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. For example, low bone mineral density is a known risk factor for vertebral fractures that may impair the respiratory function of COVID-19 patients in the rehabilitation phase <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. It was recently reported that thoracic vertebral fractures occurred in 36% of COVID-19 patients and increased the patients’ need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P20">Osteoporosis, which is characterized by decrease in bone mass, microarchitectural bone disruption, and skeletal fragility leading to higher fracture rate, has been extensively reported in critically ill patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. The inflammatory cytokines are suggested to be one of the most vital mediators of the pathological bone loss that occurs in these diseases because they not only activate osteoclasts, but also impede osteoblast function <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Cytokine dysregulation has been associated with various clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including some involving the musculoskeletal system, such as myalgia, sarcopenia, arthralgia, and arthritis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. Mechanistically, our findings in this study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 induced pathological bone resorption through two waves of cytokine storms instead of direct infection in the skeletal tissue. Since we didn’t detect significant upregulation in gene expression of <italic>IL-1</italic>β from bone tissue, the increase in IL-1β level in bone tissue may primarily attribute to the SARS-CoV-2-induced immune response in the respiratory system. After the first wave of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and TNF-α) reaches skeletal tissue via circulation, they quickly modulated the monocyte-macrophage lineage residing there to initiate a second wave of cytokine storm in the bone tissue. The second wave of cytokines produced in the skeletal system, including but not limited to IFN-γ, IL-6, and PGE2, not only contribute to osteoclastogenesis in several interdependent signaling pathways <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, but also augment the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1β and TNF-α by upregulating the expression of IL-1R1, which was implicated to primarily mediate pathological bone resorption <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P21">Among the various inflammatory factors that may be associated with osteoclastogenesis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>, we identified IL-1β and TNF-α as the key mediators for SARS-CoV-2-induced bone loss in the hamster model. As two of the most significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokines in the serum samples of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, IL-1β and TNF-α synergistically contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the skeletal tissue, leading to inflammatory bone loss. IL-1β and TNF-α have been respectively reported to play essential roles in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Besides, they are also demonstrated to be interdependent in mediating inflammatory osteopenia <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. We found that the concurrence of three pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ) in the bone tissue after SARS-CoV-2 infection preferably upregulated <italic>IL-1R1</italic>, which is primarily expressed in pathologically activated osteoclasts responsible for inflammatory bone destruction <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, the expression of <italic>IL-1R2</italic>, which serves as a decoy receptor for IL-1β to negatively regulate IL-1β signalling, was not significantly altered. Consequently, these SARS-CoV-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines dramatically upregulate the expression of <italic>MMP9</italic> and <italic>CTSK</italic>, which are both known to play dominant roles in the degradation of extracellular matrix <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, we also found that the inflammatory cytokines elevated in COVID-19 (e.g., IL◻1β) were able to promote the formation of osteoclasts via regulating the production of RANKL from MSC, as similarly reported in other conditions <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, we demonstrated that BMMs isolated from young mice were more responsive to the pro-osteoclastic stimulation of IL◻1β. This is clinically relevant because pediatric patients generally have stronger ability to adequately respond to viral infections with rapid production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. This heightened pro-inflammatory response, together with the lower baseline pro-inflammatory state in children, makes them more susceptible to various syndromes related to immune dysregulation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. However, we also find that the involvement of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, contributed to a more prominent effect on promoting the osteoclastic activities in BMMs isolated from adult mice than the ones from young mice. This might explain why musculoskeletal symptoms are mostly seen in adult patients other than children and the elderly <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P22">Besides the immunomodulatory effect and the pro-osteoclastogenesis effect, the accumulation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in the skeletal tissue can lead to several other long-term health concerns. For example, we showed that IL_1β dramatically upregulated <italic>COX2</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic>, which both contribute to the production of PGE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>. PGE2 is not only an inflammatory mediator involved in bone modeling but also a neuromodulator that can sensitize peripheral sensory neurons leading to inflammatory pain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, the lasting (from week 0 to week 28) bone ache or burning feeling reported by more than 20% of COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> indicates long-term monitoring of the inflammatory status of bone tissue after the recovery of the disease might be necessary. The inflammation in bone tissue can also alter the output of immune cells or cytokines from the bone marrow, which are supposed to participate in combating viral infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. In our study, the significantly upregulated expression of <italic>IFN-</italic>γ and its signaling-associated genes (e.g., <italic>IRF1</italic> and <italic>IRF2</italic>) in bone tissue in response to the cytokine storm indicate they might play a role in protecting bone tissue from virus infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. However, it is also noteworthy that the expression of several vital anti-viral chemokines and cytokines, such as IFN-β <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>, IL-21 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>, CCL17 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>, remained unchanged or even downregulated in the bone tissue. Thus, the suppression in the bone marrow-derived anti-viral factors may be one of the immune evading mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further investigation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P23">In this study, we demonstrated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on systemic bone loss during the acute and post-recovery / chronic phases. We revealed the cytokine storm derived from the respiratory system as the major contributor to pathological bone resorption. IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines disrupt the balance in bone metabolism and trigger a second wave of cytokine storm in the skeletal tissue to further augment their pro-osteoclastogenesis effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>). The findings in our study highlight the need to closely monitor COVID-19 patients’ bone density. The benefits of prophylactic interventions against the development of pathological bone loss in COVID-19 patients should be further evaluated in animal models and clinical trials.</p>

<p id="P27">Histology and immunohistochemical staining were performed on both paraffin sections and cryosections. In brief, the bone specimens, after fixation in 4% PFA for 48 hours, were decalcified with 12.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 weeks. For paraffin sections, the specimens were processed, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 μm-thick sections using a rotary microtome (RM215, Leica Microsystems, Germany). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, TRAP staining (Sigma-Aldrich), and ALP staining (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed on selected sections from each sample following manufacturer’s instructions. Images were captured using the Vectra Polaris Imaging System (Akoya Biosciences, USA).

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="P29">The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from the long bones of 3-month-old or 6-month-old C57L6/J mice. In brief, the mice were euthanized with overdosage of intraperitoneal injection of Pentobarbital. After the removal of attached soft tissues using forceps and gauze, the dislocated femurs and tibias were dissected into pieces. The whole bone marrow cells were resuspended in a serum-free DMEM medium (Gibco, USA) using a vortex mixer, while the bone chips and debridement were removed by passing the mixture through a cell strainer. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in a DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (complete DMEM medium), and cultured in culture flasks. After a 6-h incubation in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C, the unattached cells were gently removed for the induction of BMMs. Meanwhile, the attached bone marrow cells were gently washed in PBS and further cultured as MSCs in a complete DMEM medium until they reached 80% confluence. The culture medium was refreshed every 2 days, and only passages 3–5 were used for the experiments. After the 3-day macrophage induction using a complete DMEM medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), the BMMs became adherent for the osteoclastic differentiation using a complete DMEM supplemented with 50 ng/ml of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL, R&amp;D System, USA) and 20 ng/ml of M-CSF (R&amp;D System, USA). The coculture of BMMs with MSCs was done using a transwell system (0.4 μm pore size, Corning Costar, USA). In brief, MSCs were seeded in the transwell inserts and cultured overnight with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for attachment. Afterwards, the transwell inserts were placed into the lower chambers in which BMMs have been differentiated using medium supplemented with M-CSF for three days as described previously. To mimic the challenge of pro-inflammatory microenvironment in COVID-19, 1 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-1b (R&amp;D system, USA) was supplemented in the medium. For the inhibition of IL-1β, 10 ng/mL IL-1b neutralizing antibody (Abcam, ab9722) was added to the cell culture. For studying the synergistic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on BMMs, the culture medium of BMMs was further supplemented with 1 ng/mL TNF-α (R&amp;D system, USA) and 1 ng/mL IFN-γ (R&amp;D system, USA).</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay</title>
<p id="P30">The total RNA from the bone specimens were isolated using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA from the cultured cells was extracted and purified using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the reverse transcript, complementary DNA was synthesized using a Takara RT Master Mix (Takara, Japan), following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used in the RT-qPCR assay were synthesized using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Singapore), based on sequences designed using Primer-BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, Table S1) or retrieved from the Primer Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/">http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/</ext-link>, Table S2). The SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan) was used for the amplification and detection of cDNA targets on the LightCycler480 Real-time PCR system (Roche, USA). The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of each target gene was normalized to the housekeeping genes (i.e., RPL18 or GAPDH). The results were shown in a fold change using the ∆∆Ct method.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="P31">The proteins from homogenized bone tissue from the hamsters were isolated using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins from cultured BMMs were harvested using RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer (ThermoFisher, USA) containing 1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher, USA). The concentration of protein was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, USA). A total of 20 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Merck Millipore, USA). Then, the membrane was blocked in 5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated with blocking buffer-diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used included mouse anti-NFATc1 (Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti-TRAP (Abcam), rabbit anti-Cathepsin K (Abcam), mouse anti-RANK (Abcam), rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 (CST), rabbit anti-IL-1β (Abcam), rabbit anti-IL-1RA (Abcam), rabbit anti-TNF-α (Abcam), rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (CST), rabbit anti-JNK (CST), rabbit anti-β-actin (Abcam), The protein bands were visualized by using HRP conjugated secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (Advansta, USA) and exposed under the Typhoon5 Biomolecular Imager 680 (GE Amersham, USA).</p>

<title>ELISA assay</title>
<p id="P32">The serum samples of the hamsters were collected at 4 dpi for cytokine/chemokine analysis. The serum level of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 were detected using specific ELISA kit (MyBiosource, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<sec id="S20">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P33">All data analyses were performed and illustrated using the Prism software (version 7, GraphPad, USA). The results were expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group was clearly shown as dot plots in the figures and indicated in the legends. For comparisons among multiple groups, a one-way or a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison <italic>post hoc</italic> test. The levels of significant difference among the groups were defined and noted as *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. The sample size was decided based on preliminary data, as well as on observed effect sizes.</p>
