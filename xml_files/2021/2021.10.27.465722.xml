A recent study improved sustained attention temporarily by training healthy participants to up-regulate the differential activity of the sustained attention network (SAN) minus the default mode network (DMN). However, long-term learning effects of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training remain under-explored. Here, we evaluate the effects of network-based fMRI neurofeedback training for sustained attention by assessing behavioral and brain measures before, one day after, and two months after training. The behavioral measures include task as well as questionnaire scores, and the brain measures include activity and connectivity during self-regulation runs without feedback (i.e., transfer runs) and during resting-state runs. Neurally, we found that participants maintained their ability to control the differential activity during follow-up sessions. Further, exploratory analyses showed that the training-induced increase in FC between the DMN and occipital gyrus was maintained during follow-up transfer runs, but not during follow-up resting-state runs. Behaviorally, we found that enhanced sustained attention right after training returned to baseline level during follow-up. The discrepancy between lasting regulation-related brain changes but transient behavioral and resting-state effects raises the question of how neural changes induced by neurofeedback training translate to potential behavioral improvements. Since neurofeedback directly targets brain measures to indirectly improve behavior long-term, a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations during and after neurofeedback training is needed to develop its full potential as a promising scientific and clinical tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fMRI-neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>follow-up</kwd><kwd>sustained attention</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>resting state</kwd><kwd>psychophysiological interaction (PPI)</kwd><kwd>behavioral effects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback that provides individuals with real-time sensory information from their own brain activity, over which voluntary control can be learned with training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>]. Neurofeedback training has been associated with behavioral changes, which makes it an interesting approach for studying brain-behavior relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sulzer et al., 2013a</xref>]. Neurofeedback training has also produced clinical benefits, which makes it a promising clinical intervention for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Linhartová et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Martz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sokunbi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sulzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Taschereau-Dumouchel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The reported effects of neurofeedback training include transient as well as lasting changes. For cognitive enhancement and clinical applications of neurofeedback training, lasting effects are particularly important. Behaviorally, several studies reported that neurofeedback was associated with changes that lasted beyond the initial training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mehler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Zilverstand et al., 2015a</xref>]. Some studies even found that clinical symptoms “continue to improve for weeks after neurofeedback” training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>]. Also neurally, lasting plastic brain changes have been reported, including resting-state functional connectivity (FC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Megumi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scheinost et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>] and brain structural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sampaio-Baptista et al., 2021</xref>]. Lasting brain changes combined with behavioral modulations induced by neurofeedback training provide new insights into how they relate to each other. Hence, investigating long-term effects of neurofeedback training will help understanding its learning mechanisms and might facilitate the use of neurofeedback for enhancing cognition and clinical symptoms.</p><p id="P3">Here we investigate lasting behavioral and neural changes following neurofeedback training of sustained attention. Sustained attention is a cognitive function that supports the continuous focus on a particular external object for extended periods of time. Neuroimaging correlates of sustained attention comprise the sustained attention network (SAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Langner and Eickhoff, 2013</xref>], which combines regions from the frontoparietal control network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dosenbach et al., 2008</xref>] and the dorsal attention network (DAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>]. In contrast, default mode network (DMN) activation is related to internally-focused cognitive processes and mind-wandering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>]. DMN activation is therefore associated with stimulus-independent thoughts and reduced attention during the execution of an externally-oriented task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hinds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lawrence et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>]. The SAN (more specifically, its DAN components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Spreng, 2012</xref>]) and DMN are intrinsically anticorrelated, as they are engaged in antagonistic processes reflecting externally- vs. internally-oriented attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Spreng, 2012</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that sustained attention can be improved to some extent through training simultaneous up-regulation of the sustained attention network (SAN) and down-regulation of the default-mode network (DMN) using fMRI neurofeedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pamplona et al., 2020a</xref>]. We found that participants in the neurofeedback group were able to regulate their differential SAN-DMN activity and showed improved sustained attention directly after the training. No such improvement was observed in a test-retest control group, which only performed the behavioral sustained attention tasks, but did not undergo neurofeedback training.</p><p id="P4">Regarding lasting effects, we hypothesize that the neural and behavioral changes induced by the neurofeedback training persist beyond the training. Specifically, we hypothesized that regulation performance in brain regions successfully trained using neurofeedback and the associated improved sustained attention would be maintained long-term. We also hypothesized that functional connectivity changes specific to the successfully trained brain regions would be observed in the long term. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed unpublished data of runs without feedback (i.e., transfer runs) and resting-state runs, from before, immediately after, and two-months after neurofeedback training. We also explored the data in terms of immediate and lasting whole-brain activation and functional connectivity changes. Finally, we explored associations between brain connectivity changes and behavioral effects. Specifically, we investigated (i) the persistence of learned regulation in SAN, DMN, and their constituent regions two months after training to characterize maintained self-regulation; (ii) changes in pre-training functional connectivity directly after training and two months later to investigate lasting brain connectivity alterations with (transfer runs) and without regulation (resting-state runs); (iii) changes in resting-state functional connectivity of SAN and DMN regions directly after training and two months later using a graph theoretical approach; (iv) persistence of training-induced attentionmeasured by task and questionnaires two months after neurofeedback training to assess the permanence of behavioral effects arising from neurofeedback training; and (v) associations of functional connectivity changes in transfer and resting-state runs with behavioral changes directly after training and two months later.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P5">We included data from a previously published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pamplona et al., 2020a</xref>] that comprised a neurofeedback training group who performed sustained attention tasks before and after training. The study also included a control group who only performed the sustained attention tasks twice without neurofeedback training, separated by a two-week interval which corresponds to the duration of the neurofeedback training in the experimental group. For the present study, we analyzed data only from the neurofeedback group, which consisted of 15 healthy volunteers (5 females, mean age: 27.9 ± 3.3 years old, age range = [22.6, 34.5] years old). Data included psychometric tasks, transfer and resting-state runs before, directly after, and two months after neurofeedback training. Exclusion criteria were left-handedness, strong vision deficiency that could not be corrected using contact lenses, insufficient knowledge of English, history of mental and/or cardiovascular disorders, not being able to abstain from alcohol or other drugs during the days of the experiment, and MRI contraindications. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich in Switzerland. All participants read and signed the informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) before taking part in the study. They received financial compensation of 25 CHF per hour for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><label>2.2</label><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec id="S5"><title>Timeline of experimental procedure</title><p id="P6">Each participant took part in a five-day longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) that involved fMRI-neurofeedback training and pre/post-training sessions for neural and behavioral assessment of neurofeedback training. The neurofeedback training consisted of ten real-time fMRI runs that took place on the second and third days of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), split into five runs each day. Each neurofeedback training session lasted about 45 min. The interval between training days for each participant was a maximum of seven days. Neurofeedback training runs consisted of five cycles of baseline, regulation, and intermittent feedback blocks, lasting 30 s, 40 s, and 4 s, respectively. To indicate the period of baseline, regulation, and feedback blocks, participants were presented with a black square, a black up-arrow, and a graded blue-to-red thermometer on the center of a white screen, respectively. We acquired individual transfer runs – used to test learned self-regulation in situations where feedback is not available – directly before and directly after training (second and third days of the experiment, respectively), as well as two transfer runs two months after the end of training (fifth day of the experiment). On the first, fourth, and fifth days of the experiment, the participants filled attention-related questionnaires (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">section 2.3</xref>) and underwent anatomical and resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Attention tasks were performed outside the scanner. These measurements were made approximately at the same time of the day. The intervals between first and second days, between third and fourth days, and third and fifth days were 7 days maximum, 1 day maximum, and 61 ± 3 days, respectively. Hence, the terms pre-training, post-training, and follow-up correspond to measurements acquired on the first and second days, third and fourth days, and fifth days of the experiment, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Instructions</title><p id="P7">Instructions for self-regulation strategies during neurofeedback training were provided in written form outside the MR scanner room, prior to scanning. We instructed participants to relax and let their minds wander during baseline blocks and to engage in one of the suggested regulation strategies ((1) constantly reorienting the focus on different aspects of the arrow every 5-10 s; (2) focusing on the black up-arrow and bringing attention back to it whenever detecting task-unrelated thoughts; (3) staying in a state of high alertness) during regulation blocks. Participants were told that they could explore other regulation strategies and adopt the ones that worked best for them. Participants were also explicitly informed that, during baseline blocks, they should not plan regulation tasks. For the pre-training transfer run, participants were asked to choose one of the suggested regulation strategies and employ it during this run. For the post-training and follow-up transfer runs, participants were asked to use the strategy that worked best throughout the neurofeedback training.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MRI acquisition</title><p id="P8">All MR images were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil in the MR center of the Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zürich, Switzerland. Functional images were acquired using a T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted gradient-echo-planar (EPI) sequence with repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 80°, and field of view (FOV) = 240 x 240 mm<sup>2</sup>. 37 slices were acquired in ascending order to cover the entire cerebrum (voxel size = 3 x 3 x 4 mm<sup>3</sup>, gap = 0.5 mm). SofTone mode was activated to reduce acoustic scanner noise. Anatomical T1-weighted brain images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE (magnetization prepared gradient echo) sequence, TR/TE = 7.2/3.4 ms, 170 slices, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, flip angle = 8°, FOV = 240 mm x 240 mm<sup>2</sup>, duration = 3.5 min. Resting-state fMRI acquisitions comprised 200 scans (6 min 40 s) during which participants were asked to not move, relax, breath regularly, look at a central black circle presented on a white screen for visual fixation, and not to think about anything in particular. Neurofeedback training and transfer acquisitions comprised 190 scans (6 min 20 s) and 180 scans (6 min), respectively. Before every functional acquisition, five dummy scans were acquired to establish steady-state magnetizations. Visual stimuli were presented with MR-compatible goggles (Resonance Technology Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Definitions of target networks</title><p id="P9">To improve sustained attention through neurofeedback training, we simultaneously promoted the activation of four representative regions-of-interest (ROIs) from the sustained attention network (SAN) and the deactivation of four representative ROIs from the default mode network (DMN), areas positively and negatively associated with sustained attention performance, respectively. The SAN ROIs were defined using a mask of meta-analytic clusters from a comprehensive study on sustained attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Langner and Eickhoff, 2013</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). The selected SAN ROIs were the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC), the right inferior frontal junction (R IFJ), the right temporoparietal junction (R TPJ), and the right intraparietal sulcus (R IPS), chosen to represent multiple functional aspects of the ability of sustained attention. The aMCC is related to conflict processing, monitoring performance, and enhanced vigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hinds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Langner and Eickhoff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>]; the R IFJ is related to stimuli discrimination and attention switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Langner and Eickhoff, 2013</xref>]; the R TPJ is associated with bottom-up attention reorienting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>]; and the R IPS is associated with top-down attention reorienting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Harris et al., 2000</xref>]. The ROIs representing the aMCC and the R IFJ were spatially eroded from the original meta-analytic clusters to reduce their volume. The selected DMN ROIs were the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and bilateral angular gyri (L Ang and R Ang). These regions are the most consistently reported DMN regions – the so-called core regions of the DMN – and robustly activated during self-generated tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>], in contrast to externally-oriented attention tasks. To account for individual differences, the DMN ROIs were defined using the resting-state acquisitions from each participant. More specifically, we first performed an independent component analysis (ICA) as implemented in Gift (mialab.mrn.org/software/gift) with a predefined number of 30 components. Next, using the Personode toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pamplona et al., 2020b</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/personode">www.nitrc.org/projects/personode</ext-link>), we created 6-mm-radius spherical ROIs centered on probabilistic peaks that maximally represented each DMN regions for each individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Feedback estimation and presentation</title><p id="P10">Real-time signal processing was performed using OpenNFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Koush et al., 2017</xref>].

First, for neurofeedback training runs, the signal averaged within each ROI was rescaled in real-time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koush et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pamplona et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Scharnowski et al., 2012</xref>]. Next, the resulting signals were averaged within SAN and DMN separately. Finally, the difference between SAN and DMN signals (differential activity SAN minus DMN) was fed back intermittently to the participant as the thermometer level, right after regulation blocks. Participants were asked to raise the thermometer level as much as possible, which could be achieved either by SAN upregulation, DMN downregulation, or both. The thermometer level, comprised of 10 negative (for DMN &gt; SAN), zero, and 10 positive readings (for SAN &gt; DMN), was proportional to the participant’s performance in the current block. Feedback presentation was adaptive for each run based on performance in previous runs, i.e., feedback was made more difficult if the task was relatively easy for the participant and vice-versa. At the end of each run, a monetary reward proportional to their performance in each run was shown to the participant (CHF 20.6 ± 5.4 in total per participant) and added to the final compensation to the participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.3</label><title>Psychometric tasks and questionnaires</title><p id="P11">To evaluate mental strategies associated with neurofeedback training, we asked participants to report the used strategies immediately after each neurofeedback training run.

We used linear mixed models to account for the hierarchical structure (multiple measurements of response time for each subject), with the factors Session and Trial; Trial being a continuous variable. Since we were interested in differences in reaction time over trials across sessions, we checked whether the two-way interaction Session x Trial was significant.

Since we observed thalamic activity during self-regulation a long time after the end of training, it might be that the thalamus activity was associated with arousal related to compensating for a less automatic state of sustained attention, compared to directly after training.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><label>4.2</label><title>Lasting neurofeedback effects on functional connectivity vs. transient behavioral changes</title><p id="P39">Our neurofeedback training induced both short- and long-term changes in regFC and rsFC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Previous studies have reported changes in FC due to neurofeedback training in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scheinost et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>] and healthy participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Megumi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>]. As argued by Rance and colleagues, changes in FC may be continuously reinforced after neurofeedback training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>] over the course of days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harmelech et al., 2013</xref>], weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>], or months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Megumi et al., 2015</xref>]. Our findings further support claims that neurofeedback can induce FC changes that are maintained for several months.</p><p id="P40">The most consistent FC changes that we observed were related to increased FC between the DMN and the occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). More specifically, we observed that the regFC between DMN and occipital cortex increased during post-training and follow-up runs compared to pre-training runs. A previous PPI study showed that, when the frontoparietal control network is engaged, the connectivity between DMN and the occipital cortex increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Karten et al., 2013</xref>]. It was suggested that the increase in the DMN-occipital cortex connectivity reveals a competitive interaction suppressing the bottom-up visual stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Karten et al., 2013</xref>] and protecting internal attentive processes from potentially distracting sensory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benedek et al., 2016</xref>]. In addition, the suppression of externally and internally distracting information, i.e., generated in the visual cortex and the DMN, respectively, is closely linked to each other and predictive of task performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anticevic et al., 2012</xref>]. In our study, the SAN has components from the frontoparietal control network, specifically the aMCC and the rTPJ. The aMCC was clearly engaged during the post-training and follow-up runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, the engagement of frontoparietal control network during transfer runs might have also increased the connectivity between DMN and occipital cortex. In fact, we observed that greater regFC between DMN and occipital cortex were associated with faster response time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), when comparing post-training with pre-training sessions. Such an association might indicate that participants learn to simultaneously suppress distracting externally and internally information and that this ability was also employed during the sustained attention task. As the task was conducted one day after the neurofeedback training, these effects might be lasting. However, these associations were not observed when comparing follow-up and pre-training sessions. Thus, while the improved regulation-related FC was maintained long term, the improved attentional performance was not. This dissociation indicates that learned brain self-regulation can be applied upon request, but does not necessarily translate in behavioral effects long-term.</p><p id="P41">Interestingly, we also observed FC changes in resting-state runs following the end of training. First, the rsFC between DMN and occipital cortex increased one day after the end of training, but was not different from pre-training runs two months after the end of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Akin to the behavioral effects that did not last, also the rsFC changes that indicated plastic changes in the functional coupling between DMN and the occipital cortex were not maintained even though participants were still able to regulate and regFC changes persisted. However, lasting changes in the degree of FC in successfully trained ROIs during resting-state runs were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Because during resting-state runs no active self-regulation was required, such FC changes likely represent plastic brain changes that are unrelated to concurrent mental strategies activations. And it is unlikely that they are artefactual, as the change in the degree of rsFC was specific to regions that were successfully trained with neurofeedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>), probably supporting the acquired ability to regulate brain activity. Previous studies have found lasting resting-state changes following neurofeedback training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Megumi et al., 2015</xref>]. Some recent studies have even reported brain structural changes associated with neurofeedback training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Papoutsi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sampaio-Baptista et al., 2021</xref>], showing the potential of neurofeedback to produce lasting effects on brain structure and processing.</p><p id="P42">Sustained attention improved to some extent right after neurofeedback training, but this improvement did not last (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, other studies reported persistent or even increasing behavioral effects following neurofeedback training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cortese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shibata et al., 2011</xref>]. However, also other neurofeedback studies found that behavioral effects that were present right after training did not persist. For example, an EEG-based neurofeedback study on nicotine addiction reported that short-term changes in symptom reduction were followed by a gradual return toward the baseline in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bu et al., 2019</xref>]. Why neurofeedback training sometimes induces lasting or even improving behavioral effects while sometimes such effects do not persist is a crucial question especially for clinical neurofeedback applications. Here, we can only speculate that, for example, the effect size of the initial behavioral improvement might matter. Our study trained healthy participants in a cognitive domain that we are highly trained in – attention. As a consequence, the behavioral improvement was rather small, possibly due to ceiling effects. This might be different in clinical samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, studies on follow-up neurofeedback should, whenever possible, contain information about effect sizes to help elucidate this argument. Another factor might be that for behavioral effects to increase over time, frequent use of learned self-regulation in everyday situations might be important. Such practice is more likely the case in clinical populations and can be promoted by, for example, electronic diaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Zaehringer et al., 2019</xref>]. In general, the association between neurofeedback-induced brain changes and behavioral effects remains yet to be clarified. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shibata et al. (2011</xref>) found improved perceptual sensitivity after neurofeedback training even when participants did not actively self-regulate their visual cortex activity, whereas another study found that sensitivity improved only when participants actively up-regulated visual cortex activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Scharnowski et al., 2012</xref>]. In the present study we found lasting brain changes but the behavioral effects were only transient. Only the rsFC brain changes showed the same pattern as the behavioral effects: they were present during post-training runs but no longer during follow-up runs. Following this temporal coincidence, one might speculate that rsFC changes might serve as a correlate for behavioral effects, but such a speculation requires further investigation.</p><p id="P43">Also, the relationship between mental strategies and behavioral changes requires further investigation. In our study, the individual choice of mental strategies cannot easily explain that sustained attention improved one day after neurofeedback training but no longer during follow-up 2 months later. Most subjects used the same strategies in both sessions and most of these strategies were closely related to externally- and internally-oriented focused attention during regulation and baseline blocks, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in the follow-up session, participants were not reminded of their strategies adopted during the initial training. Further, performance during follow-up transfer runs was not dependent on whether participants used the same strategy as right after training or a different one. Thus, learned self-regulation did not seem to depend on remembering and applying the exact mental strategy that was adopted during training.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><label>4.3</label><title>Outreach</title><p id="P44">First, whenever possible, one should include follow-up neuroimaging assessments of functional and/or anatomical plasticity due to the training, rather than only shortly after intervention or only behavioral or regulation-specific measurements. Although still specific to the MR setting, resting-state assessments may better reflect transfer effects of neurofeedback training because they are independent of self-regulation efforts. Follow-up neuroimaging measurements can help indicate neural reshaping over time after completed interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Robineau et al., 2017</xref>]. If neurofeedback-induced effects continue to increase over time, measuring them only shortly after a training intervention may lead to undervalued or undetected behavioral effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>]. Importantly, follow-up sessions may help consolidate neuroscientific theories using neurofeedback as a causal intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sulzer et al., 2013b</xref>] and define biomarkers as targets for neurotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>]. Second, since it is desired in a clinical setting that a given intervention converts practice into enduring effects, follow-up assessments can justify whether the proposed neurofeedback approach is a meaningful alternative for therapy. Therefore, neurofeedback studies that address symptoms should always rely on follow-up evaluations. Third, we note that, while clear long-lasting effects in terms of neural self-regulation may exist, persistent behavioral changes can eventually be dissociated from brain findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>].</p><p id="P45">Therefore, follow-up evaluations of behavioral effects should also be conducted whenever possible. An eventual brain-behavior dissociation may raise questions about the utility of a proposed neurofeedback approach for modulating behavior or mitigating symptoms in an out-of-scanner scenario, the strategic choice of sensitive psychometric instruments, and the characterization of the targeted population. Fourth, we argue that, whenever possible, neurofeedback training and resting-state/psychometric acquisitions should be made on different days, since sleep plays an important role in consolidating learning and producing lasting changes in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Walker and Stickgold, 2004</xref>]. Fifth, our study provides evidence that short sessions are sufficient (two training sessions of 45 min on separate days) to produce long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>] in terms of regulation of brain activity and connectivity changes.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><label>4.4</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="P46">The main limitation of this study is that the follow-up assessments did not include a control group. While the original study included at least a control group that performed the psychometric tasks without neurofeedback training, the present analysis does not include a behavioral nor a neurofeedback control group. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the observed brain changes were caused by neurofeedback training. The brain changes could, in principle, be due to, for example, spontaneous fluctuations over time, habituation to the MR environment, or fatigue. On the other hand, the fact that the post-training self-regulation results were reproducible during follow-up runs two months later and the fact that the brain changes were predominantly specific to the trained brain areas suggest that the brain changes were indeed associated with neurofeedback training.</p><p id="P47">A second major limitation is the modest sample size. Resource constraints like limited MR scanner availability and scanning costs make scanning larger samples difficult, especially because participants in neurofeedback experiments are being scanned repeatedly. With N = 15 and each of these subjects having been scanned on 5 different days (resulting in a total of 75 MR acquisitions), this study is well within the standard range for fMRI-based neurofeedback studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fede et al., 2020</xref>]. To accommodate the moderate sample size statistically, non-parametric tests such as TFCE for statistical mapping in low sample sizes were used.</p><p id="P48">Finally, the follow-up session was acquired two months after the end of the training. While two months seem sufficiently long to assess lasting effects that go beyond immediate post-training changes, other studies showed that neurofeedback training effects can last much longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ramot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Robineau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Zilverstand et al., 2015b</xref>]. Hence, from one follow-up after two months we cannot infer the temporal course and an upper bound for neurofeedback training effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P49">The goal of neurofeedback training is to modulate behavior, emotion, cognition, or clinical symptoms long-term through self-regulating brain activity. To evaluate whether this ambition has been achieved, follow-up assessments are key. We found that two months after the end of neurofeedback training participants were still able to exert self-regulation of the differential SAN-DMN activity, and this during transfer runs without feedback. Lasting brain changes also included FC measures of the trained ROIs to other brain regions in runs during which participants engaged in active self-regulation as well as during resting-state runs without concomitant self-regulation. These results provide information on important facets of follow-up assessments: (a) maintenance of the initially learned self-regulation skill (i.e., SAN-DMN regulation), (b) maintenance of brain changes related to self-regulation that go beyond the trained ROIs (i.e., FC changes during transfer runs), and (c) plastic brain changes in the absence of ongoing self-regulation (i.e., resting-state changes). Another important aspect of follow-up assessments is (d) behavioral effects. While others found behavioral effects to increase after neurofeedback training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rance et al., 2018</xref>], the (relatively weak) behavioral effects we observed right after the training did not persist. Such a discrepancy between lasting brain changes but transient behavioral effects poses important questions regarding the brain-behavior associations above and beyond neurofeedback. Overall, this study highlights the importance of follow-up investigations of neural and behavioral changes associated with neurofeedback training, so that this promising approach can develop its full potential as a scientific and clinical tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS147038-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAeFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS147038-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAeFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS147038-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAeFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS147038-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAeFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS147038-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAeFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Dustin Scheinost for providing technical advice on the intrinsic connectivity distribution, Dr. Alfonso Nieto-Castanon for support with CONN software, Dr. Philipp Stämpfli for technical support with imaging, and Prof. Christian Gaser for advice on the TFCE technique.
