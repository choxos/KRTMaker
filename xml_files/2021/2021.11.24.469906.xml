<title>Introductory</title>
<p id="P1">The evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the emergence of many new variant lineages that have exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those variants were designated as variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) by national or international authorities based on many factors including their potential impact on vaccines. To ascertain and rank the risk of VOCs and VOIs, we analyzed their ability to escape from vaccine-induced antibodies. The variants showed differential reductions in neutralization and replication titers by post-vaccination sera. Although the Omicron variant showed the most escape from neutralization, sera collected after a third dose of vaccine (booster sera) retained moderate neutralizing activity against that variant. Therefore, vaccination remains the most effective strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in China in December 2019; within six months a variant with a D614G substitution in the viral spike protein became the predominant circulating strain globally. While the D614G variant did not evade antibody-mediated neutralization, enhanced replication and transmissibility of the variant were confirmed in multiple animal models by different groups<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Enhanced transmissibility and a larger infected population likely led to diversification of the D614G variant into many new lineages. In December 2020, the United Kingdom reported increased transmission of a novel variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, also referred to as the Alpha (or B.1.1.7, Pango nomenclature) variant<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The Alpha variant rapidly disseminated and became the predominant circulating strain in many countries, including the United States (US)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Meanwhile, the Beta (i.e., B.1.351) and Gamma (i.e., P.1) variants were first detected in South Africa in May 2020 and in Brazil in November 2020, respectively, where each variant became the predominant lineage in its respective geographic region<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. By August 2021, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), which was first identified in India<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, had displaced the Alpha variant and become the predominant variant within the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and globally. The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which was first reported in late November, is rapidly spreading as of December 2021 and on pace to displace the Delta variant in many regions of the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities, such as the US government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (US-SIG), have designated selected SARS-CoV-2 variants as VOCs or VOIs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) based on genomic analysis, transmissibility, disease severity, and, most importantly, impact on the performance of therapeutics or vaccines. Continuous monitoring and rapid characterization of VOCs, VOIs, and other new variants are critical to alleviating the devastating impact of the current pandemic.</p>
<p id="P3">As mRNA vaccines were the earliest and primary form of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the US, we systematically evaluated the neutralization efficiency of U.S. mRNA vaccinee sera against all VOCs and VOIs designated by the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group or US-SIG. To characterize emerging variants in the shortest time frame, particularly in periods which lacked clinical isolates in the US, we generated SARS-CoV-2 fluorescent reporter viruses with VOC and VOI spike substitutions and deletions in the progenitor Wuhan-Hu-1 virus (designated as 614D in this study) by reverse genetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). The reporter SARS-CoV-2 viruses were designed to behave similarly to their clinical isolate counterparts in neutralization assays due to an identical variant spike protein, which is the sole antigen of all vaccines authorized in the US. The spike glycoproteins of many VOI/VOC lineages have subtle differences within the lineages, and the sequence of spike protein used in our studies represent the consensus for the variant lineage or represent a more divergent one from the progenitor within that lineage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). For example, the spike of Beta variant tested includes R246I in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is not found in all Beta lineage viruses.</p>
<p id="P4">Using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), we detected minimal impact of the D614G substitution (designated as virus 614G) on the neutralizing activity of the vaccinee sera (fully vaccinated, 2-to-6 weeks post second dose), compared to the progenitor 614D reference virus, of which the spike sequence is most closely related to what was used in mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) showed slightly decreased neutralizing antibody titers while the Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.4.2), Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429), Zeta (P.2), Eta (B.1.525), Iota (B.1.526/B.1.526.1), Lambda (C.37), and B.1.617.3 variants showed greater titer reductions but were &lt;4-fold reduced compared to the 614D virus. The Beta (B.1.351), Theta (P.3), Kappa (B.1.617.1), Mu (B.1.621), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants showed ≥4-fold reductions in titers, with the Omicron variants showing the greatest escape from neutralization with a 38-fold reduction compared to 614D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">As the prevalence of variants rose within the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received an increased number of clinical specimens from state public health laboratories and other CDC collaborating laboratories through the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/cdc-role-surveillance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/cdc-role-surveillance.html</ext-link>). We isolated representative variants from these clinical specimens for characterization by FRNT and sequenced the stocks to ensure the spike correctly represented the appropriate variant lineage. Although the reductions in neutralization differed slightly, they were generally consistent between the reporter viruses and clinical isolates. Prior to the emergence of Omicron, the Beta variant was the most resistant to neutralization, followed by Mu, Kappa and B.1.617.3. The Gamma and Delta variants showed modest escape from neutralization, and the Alpha variant neutralization was not significantly reduced as compared to the 614D reference virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Lambda was the only variant that showed a difference between the reporter virus and the clinical isolate, which had an approximate 3-fold reduction versus 1-to-1.2-fold reduction in neutralizing titers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and 2b</xref>). The Lambda variant has at least 14 substitutions/deletions in the spike (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) and the limited resistance to neutralization (1-to-1.2-fold) of clinical isolates was surprising. Two Lambda clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, Lambda-S1 and -S2) with slightly different spike sequences were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), and the results were consistent. The reporter SARS-CoV-2 system is powerful because the only difference between the viruses being analyzed is the spike, whereas natural isolates have many differences throughout the genome and it’s possible that changes in other gene products (e.g., membrane protein or envelope protein) could impact spike and/or neutralization phenotype but this remains to be understood.</p>
<p id="P6">Shortly after the first case of Omicron was confirmed in the US on December 1, we isolated multiple Omicron variants from clinical specimens. Independently, we also collected sera from US vaccinees who received the third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (booster) on the day of the booster vaccination (referred as pre-booster sera) and 2-to-6 weeks after the booster vaccination (referred as booster sera). The booster sera had much higher neutralizing titers against the progenitor virus (614D), compared to the post-second-dose sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) or pre-booster sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The booster sera had relatively high neutralizing titers against the Omicron variant at levels comparable to the titers of pre-booster sera against the 614D virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). While the post-second-dose sera and pre-booster sera had comparable reductions in neutralization activities (34-to-38-fold reduction), the booster sera had neutralizing activities against the Omicron variant with an average of 19-fold reduction in neutralization titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Despite the increased neutralization titers detected in booster sera, the substantial reductions in neutralizing titers against Omicron viruses relative to the 614D vaccine reference virus suggests potential for vaccine escape post booster as immunity wanes.</p>
<p id="P7">Currently circulating variants are acquiring additional substitutions/deletions, which may further affect transmission, disease severity, or vaccine effectiveness and require prompt evaluation. Utilizing the short turnaround time of reverse genetics, we generated additional Alpha and Beta reporter viruses to examine the effects of specific substitutions that occurred in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). While the 3 deletions and 7 substitutions in the Alpha variant spike protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) had a very small impact (1.3-fold) on neutralizing activity of vaccinee sera, we found the addition of the single E484K substitution in spike reduced the neutralizing titer of the Alpha variant by an additional 1.6-fold (2.1-fold compared to the 614D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The importance of spike-E484K is further demonstrated in a Beta reporter virus that encoded the spike-484 reversion (B.1.351+K484E), which was found to be 3-fold more susceptible to neutralization compared to an unmodified Beta variant B.1.351 (2.0-fold vs 6.1-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, the N501Y substitution had little impact on the neutralization of the Beta variants (5.6-fold vs. 6.1-fold). A reporter virus containing substitutions only in the Beta variant receptor binding domain (RBD) (B.1.351-RBD, K417N+E484K+N501Y+D614G) was 1.7-fold more susceptible to neutralization compared to the Beta variant with full substitutions/deletions (i.e., 3.6-fold for B.1.351-RBD vs. 6.1-fold for wild type Beta). This result indicates the N-terminal domain (NTD) mutations also contribute to virus neutralization escape. This was confirmed by a Beta variant that only contains mutations in the NTD (B.1.351-NTD, L18F+D80A+D215G+L241-+L242-+A243-+R246I+614G), which reduced the neutralizing titers by 2.6-fold, compared to the 614D virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Considering the plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to substitutions and deletions, as well as the recombination-prone nature of coronaviruses, substitutions and deletions present in current variants may also occur in future variants in different combinations or in different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, it is important to use reverse genetics or other focused approaches to assess the impact and understand the functionality of specific mutations in naturally occurring variants.</p>
<p id="P8">To better understand the effect of variant spikes on viral fitness in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies, we compared the replication of reporter viruses with the variant spikes in Calu-3 cells, which are a human lung epithelial cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In the absence of inhibitory sera, while Delta replicated to significantly higher titer than the original S-614D reference virus, its infectious titer was comparable to the S-614G virus and many other variants. Interestingly, in the presence of sera, even highly diluted, the titers of 614D and 614G viruses were reduced by more than 7-fold at 2x sera concentration (FRNT<sub>50</sub> = 2) and more than 300-fold at 5x sera concentration (FRNT<sub>50</sub> = 5). As anticipated from neutralization escape data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), the Beta and Omicron variants replicated efficiently in the presence of both concentrations of sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Intriguingly, the Delta variant also replicated efficiently and only had a 3-fold reduction in titer at 5x sera concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The Delta variant’s ability to replicate efficiently in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antisera may have facilitated infections of people with low-to-modest levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by prior infection or vaccination. The immune evasion of Delta variant may be an additive or synergistic result of spike mutations that reduce neutralizing activity and fitness advantages (e.g., better S1/S2 cleavage and cell entry) that are unrelated to neutralization but enhance replication and transmission.</p>
<p id="P9">Notably, all post-second-dose sera tested neutralized these variants with FRNT<sub>50</sub> titers higher than 10 and most of them higher than 40, except against the Omicron variant, which had neutralizing titers between 5 and 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). It has been widely accepted in the influenza vaccine field that a neutralizing titer (hemagglutination inhibition titer) of 40 or higher is deemed protective (&gt;50% reduction of infection rate)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> and a 8-fold reductions in neutralization <italic>in vitro</italic> is a consideration for updating the influenza vaccine strain. For COVID-19 vaccines, few studies on correlates of protection have been published but suggest a titer of 50-100 is the minimum protective neutralizing titer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> and the fold reduction warranting a vaccine change have yet to be determined. This is also complicated by the unknown role of other effectors in vaccine protection such as memory B-cell or T cell immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. However, the level of neutralizing antibody titer is apparently predictive of the level of immune protection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. As neutralizing antibodies wane over time<sup>

</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), infections in fully vaccinated persons by variants circulating at high prevalence are likely to increase. This is especially true for the Omicron variant because the number and location of changes in the S result in considerable antibody escape. Nevertheless, vaccines do prevent and attenuate COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> and anamnestic responses provided through rapid expansion of memory cells should accelerate viral clearance. Therefore, closely monitoring the emergence of variants resistant to neutralization is a necessary and urgent task, and vaccination, including booster doses, remains the most effective strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Risk-benefit analysis</title>
<p id="P13">A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis was conducted for using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 reporter viruses in neutralization assays. Briefly, the benefits of using the reporter viruses are: 1) enabling rapid characterization of variants before they are detected in the United States or before CDC receives specimens; 2) eliminating all fixation and staining steps in neutralization assays, shortening the time infectious samples are handled, and reducing chemical safety risks (e.g., formalin) by removing the need to fix cells; 3) minimizing the impact of substitutions in non-spike genes on neutralizing titers, as changes solely reflect the effect of spike mutations; 4) enabling assessment of impact of individual or specific sets of spike mutations; 5) enabling more consistent comparisons as isolates from different clinical specimens were noted to have distinct growth properties even though they were from the same lineage. The associated risk assessments are: 1) reporter viruses are different from any natural virus and created by introducing the spike mutations from a new variant into the backbone virus (progenitor strain Wuhan-Hu-1). The transmissibility of a particular resultant virus could be somewhere between the progenitor virus and the natural variant; 2) as there is limited epidemiological or clinical evidence to suggest spike mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants increase pathogenicity, it is most likely the pathogenicity of the reporter viruses will be equivalent or reduced as compared to the progenitor strain or the variant strain; 3) all naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants descending from the progenitor strain have acquired mutations in other genes along with the spike gene. It is possible that some of the non-spike mutations may decrease the transmissibility or pathogenicity of the variant, in which case a reporter virus may be more transmissible or pathogenic than the variant. However, sequence analysis and literature review indicate this risk is very low, especially regarding its potential public health impact during this ongoing pandemic. The safeguard and mitigation strategies are: 1) the backbone of the reporter virus are based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, which is expected to be the least transmissible strain compared to later variants; 2) a mNeonGreen reporter gene replaces the ORF7a in the reporter virus, which may attenuate the virus as the ORF7a protein has been reported to be an interferon antagonist<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>; 3) mutations engineered into a reporter virus are either part of or all of the spike mutations found in a natural isolate and the engineering of unnatural mutations is prohibited; 4) the reporter viruses are only to be used in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, such as neutralization assays, and not in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies; 5) all the <italic>in vitro</italic> work is conducted in BSL-3E facilities including enhanced practices such as shower out after experiments to minimize the possibility of accidental release of the reporter virus to the environment; 6) all staff working with the reporter viruses are fully vaccinated; 7) all staff are approved for working with BSL-3E select agents with senior staff having decades of BSL-3E experience working with highly pathogenic viruses. The <bold>conclusion</bold> is: under the current public health emergency, with the urgency for antigenic surveillance of variants, the benefits of using SARS-CoV-2 reporter viruses exceeds the risks associated with generating and using recombinant reporter viruses. These risks are believed to be extremely low after mitigation.</p>

<title>Neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 viruses of mRNA vaccine sera collected pre- and post-booster vaccination</title>
<p id="P25">Pre-booster sera were collected on the day of booster vaccination and post-booster sera were collected 2-to-6 weeks post booster vaccination. Viruses were isolated from clinical specimens. The average fold changes relative to reference virus 614D (set as 1-fold or pre-booster and post-booster, respectively) are shown on the top of the graph. For each variant, the average fold change is the geometric mean of the individual FRNT50 ratios (614D/variant) calculated for each serum sample. Dashed line represents the limit of quantitation (LOQ). For samples with titer below LOQ the values are still shown and used in calculating the fold change, but they should be interpreted as qualitative instead of quantitative.</p>

<title>Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States.</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalence is shown for clinical specimens processed within the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) and CDC-contracted networks by relative, daily incidence (dot icons) for key Pangolin lineages (WHO nomenclature in parentheses), VOIs/VOCs, and specimens encoding critical sequence markers (614D/G) but not belonging to those variants. Daily reported clinical cases are summarized in the bar graph (right-side, Y-axis). Cut-off date is December 12, 2021.</p>

<title>Neutralization and inhibition of mRNA vaccinee sera against live SARS-CoV-2 viruses.</title>
<p>Each dot represents the neutralizing titer (FRNT<sub>50</sub>) of an individual serum sample; at least 20 post-second-dose sera were tested against each variant. The average fold changes relative to reference virus 614D (set as 1 -fold) are shown on the top of the graph. For each variant, the average fold change is the geometric mean of the individual FRNT<sub>50</sub> ratios (614D/variant) calculated for each serum sample. Dashed line represents the limit of quantitation (LOQ). <bold>(a)</bold> All WHO and US-SIG designated SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) were tested using reporter viruses. The geometric mean FRNT<sub>50</sub> titers are shown on the graph with standard deviation. LOQ(o)=5 for Omicron and LOQ=40 for all other variants. The average fold changes of all variants differ significantly (P&lt;0.0001) from 614D, except for 614G (P=0.9999). <bold>(b)</bold> VOCs and selected VOIs isolated from clinical specimens were tested. The average fold change of all variants differs significantly (P&lt;0.001) from 614D, except for B.1.1.7 (P=0.9995) and the two C.37 viruses (C.37(λ) S1 and S2). <bold>(c)</bold> Reporter viruses with or without specific substitutions were tested to illustrate the impact of specific substitutions. B.1.351 + Y501N has the reversion to original N at 501 of S, and B.1.351 + K484E has a reversion to original E at 484 of S. B.1.351-RBD contains the K417N, E484K, N501Y substitutions in RBD along with the downstream D614G substitution. B.1.351-NTD contains the mutations in NTD along with the downstream D614G. Thin gray lines link the same serum sample tested against the different viruses. The thick black line links the geometric mean titers of different variants. <bold>(d)</bold> Calu-3 cells were infected with 200-400 focus forming unit (FFU) of each virus and incubated for 2 days in media with or without sera. The sera were pooled from the individual sera used in (a) and diluted to 2X or 5X concentration (diluted sera titer FRNT50 = 2 or 5 against 614D reference virus). The viruses were collected from Calu-3 supernatant at 2 days post inoculation and titrated by FFU assay. Titer differences are marked as *, representing p&lt;0.05 (One-way ANOVA) for statistical significance, compared to the no sera control within each variant group. Fold changes (reductions) compared to the no sera control are shown on the top of the panel.</p>
