<abstract>
<p id="P1">Global control of COVID-19 will require the deployment of vaccines capable of inducing long-term protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this report, we describe an adjuvanted subunit candidate vaccine that affords elevated, sustained and cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NAbs) in multiple animal models. Alhydroxiquim-II is a TLR7/8 small-molecule agonist chemisorbed on aluminium hydroxide. Vaccination with Alhydroxiquim-II combined with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (termed CoVac-II) resulted in high-titre NAbs in mice, with no decay in responses over an 8-month period. NAbs from sera of CoVac-II-immunized mice, horses and rabbits were broadly neutralising against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Boosting long-term CoVac-II-immunized mice with adjuvanted spike protein from the Beta variant markedly increased levels of NAb titres against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants; notably high titres against the Delta variant were observed. These data strongly support the clinical assessment of Alhydroxiquim-II-adjuvanted spike proteins to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</p>

<p id="P2">COVID-19 vaccines have had a remarkable impact on controlling the pandemic in high and middle-income countries. However, global access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines remains a critical issue<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Neutralising antibodies (NAbs) are considered the key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, yet in both natural infection and vaccination the levels of NAbs decay over time<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. This issue is compounded by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating that show partial resistance to current vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, highlighting the need for next-generation vaccines that display strong and persistent immunity.</p>
<p id="P3">Subunit vaccines represent a safe, affordable platform for COVID-19 vaccines, with positive outcomes for some candidates from clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. To develop a subunit vaccine that is suitable for global distribution, large-scale antigen manufacture and selection of adjuvants are critical issues. To address these issues, we used stabilized, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced with a fully scalable, chemically defined and GMP-compliant production process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. To create the CoVac-II vaccine candidate, trimeric spike protein was combined with Alhydroxiquim-II (AHQ-II); a small molecule toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist that is chemisorbed to alum. AHQ-II is the adjuvant used in the Covaxin COVID-19 vaccine, which has received emergency use approval in multiple countries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, recombinant spike trimer expressed and purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was stable when stored at multiple temperatures and resistant to repeated freeze-thaw cycles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Following vaccination of mice with CoVac-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), high-titre NAbs were apparent in plasma as early as 2 weeks after the first immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). NAb titres did not drop over the time course and reached their peak at 252 days post-vaccination. This corresponds with the excellent stability of both the spike antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) and adjuvant used; AHQ-II is stable for at least one year at room temperature (not shown). When compared to spike alone, AHQ-II increased NAb titres by approximately 1000-fold; this increase compares favourably to the effect seen with adjuvants Matrix-M (approximately 10-fold increase) and AS03 (approximately 500-fold) used in other SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Spike plus Alhydrogel (SpK<sup>Alum</sup>) resulted in NAb titres well above that elicited by spike alone, however titres were approximately 100-fold lower at day 252 compared to those from CoVac-II-vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">To determine the pattern of T cell immunity induced by the CoVac-II vaccine, we assessed the level of spike-specific multifunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinated mice. High frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup> were seen after CoVac-II delivery, that were absent from mice vaccinated with spike alone or SpK<sup>Alum</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This corresponds with the Th1-polarising effect of AHQ-II when delivered with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in animal models and humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. We also noted a significant correlation between NAb titres and the level of multifunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produced in individual mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). To further dissect vaccine-induced immunity, we examined the cellular make-up of the draining lymph nodes 7 days after vaccination. Both Alum<sup>SpK</sup> and CoVac-II induced expansion of spike-specific B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and T follicular helper cell (Tfh) cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The total numbers of antigen specific B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), and Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) were significantly increased in CoVac-II-vaccinated mice compared to immunization with Alum<sup>SpK</sup>. Thus, delivery of trimeric spike antigen with AHQ-II results in strong B and T cell anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response.</p>
<p id="P5">The ability of CoVac-II-induced antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) was examined using isolates of ancestral (Wuhan), as well as Alpha and Beta variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. All plasma samples from CoVac-II-immunized mice neutralised both Alpha and Beta VOCs however titres were reduced for Beta compared to the ancestral virus (8-fold reduction), which is a similar reduction as seen for other COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. NAb titres using plasma from SpK<sup>Alum</sup>-vaccinated mice were reduced to the limit of detection against Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Cross-species neutralisation of VOCs was apparent after immunization of rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) or horses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>) with CoVac-II. NAb titres were maintained against the Alpha variant in both species compared to ancestral virus, and high titres against Beta in rabbits (4.7-fold reduction compared to ancestral) and horses (2.7-fold). Thus AHQ-II can adjuvant vaccine immunogenicity across multiple animal models, adding to its already proven immunogenicity in humans as part of the Covaxin vaccine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Although CoVac-II immunisation affords some level of cross-neutralisation against the Beta variant, vaccines currently in use display reduced efficacy against this variant when assessed in placebo-controlled or test-negative control trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. We therefore used our established systems for rapid and high-level production of trimeric viral antigens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> to produce the Beta spike antigen. Mice vaccinated with CoVac-II eight months earlier (or control groups) were boosted with a single dose of Beta spike formulated in AHQ (CoVac351). Two weeks later, the ability of their plasma to neutralize Beta spike-pseudotyped virus was determined<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. The increase of NAbs in response to this booster injection was greatest in mice previously vaccinated with SpK<sup>Alum</sup> or CoVac-II (approximate increase of 16-fold compared to pre-boost levels), however responses were maximal in the CoVac-II prime, CoVac351 boosted group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). High numbers of spike-specific, multifunctional Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in PBMCs from the CoVac-II/CoVac351 group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). To determine breadth of cross neutralisation afforded by boosting with the Beta variant, plasma from CoVac-II-primed, CoVac351-boosted mice was examined for neutralisation of ‘wild-type’ virus and three VOCs; Alpha, Beta and Delta. In pre-boost samples, all VOCs were neutralised, however titres were reduced approximately 10-fold against Beta compared to ‘wild-type’ virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). However boosting with CoVac351 resulted in enhanced NAb titres against all VOCs, with greatest increase seen against the Beta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). Notably, neutralisation titres against the Delta variant were high (&gt;10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>) with only a small reduction in titre (approximately 2.2-fold) compared to ‘wild-type’ virus. Of note, these NAb titres are at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the average human convalescent response, which we have previously assessed with similar methodology, and are comparable with that of ‘elite’ neutralisers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">In conclusion, the CoVac-II subunit vaccine we described in this report demonstrates remarkable longevity of immune responses (no decay in NAbs up to 8 months post-vaccination in mice) and is highly immunogenic in multiple animal models, including rabbits and horses. The waning of immunity observed in convalescent patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> and with current vaccines, coupled with low NAb titres correlating with breakthrough infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>, suggests that maintenance of humoral immunity will be critical to ensure prolonged vaccine-induced protection against disease. NAbs developed in all immunised species are able to effectively neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which can be augmented by boosting with variant-specific spike vaccines. CoVac-II-immunity compares favourably with other vaccines tested in the same models, that have subsequently shown high-levels of protection in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. The excellent safety profile and immunogenicity demonstrated by a AHQ-II-adjuvanted inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, coupled with our ability to manufacture multiple, high quality antigens at scale <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, suggests that AHQ-II/spike protein combinations could constitute safe, affordable and mass-manufacturable COVID-19 vaccines for global distribution.</p>

The cut-off for determining the neutralisation endpoint titre of diluted serum samples was set to ≥50% neutralisation. Neutralising antibody titers in rabbit and horse immune sera were quantified at Virovax using an automated, liquid-handler-assisted, high-throughput, microfocus neutralisation/high-content imaging methods developed at ViroVax. Briefly, serially-diluted sera (paired pre-immune and immune) and SARS-CoV-2 virus (final MOI of 10) were added to 10<sup>6</sup>/mL Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81) containing 50 μg/mL of propidium iodide (PI) and plates were then loaded in an IncuCyte S3 high-content imaging system (Essen Bioscience/Sartorius, Ann Arbor, MI).
