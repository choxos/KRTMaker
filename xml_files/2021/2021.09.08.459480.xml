<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">The emergence of current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and potential future spillovers of SARS-like coronaviruses into humans pose a major threat to human health and the global economy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Development of broadly effective coronavirus vaccines that can mitigate these threats is needed <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and a substantial fraction also show notable binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against most SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and many neutralize the Omicron variant. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with targeting of conserved sites, select RBD bnAbs exhibited <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy against diverse SARS-like coronaviruses in a prophylaxis challenge model. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a molecular basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it appeared that SARS-CoV-2 was a virus that might be particularly amenable to control by vaccination. Many different vaccine modalities, most notably mRNA vaccination, showed spectacular success in phase 3 protection studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. The success was attributed at least in part to the ability of the different modalities to induce robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. However, as the virus has now infected hundreds of millions worldwide, variants have arisen (variants of concern, VOCs), some of which show notable resistance to neutralization by immunodominant nAb responses induced through infection and vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Current vaccines are still apparently largely effective in preventing hospitalization and death caused by VOCs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. However, as vaccine-induced nAb responses naturally decline, breakthrough infections are on the increase and there are concerns that these may become more prevalent and perhaps more clinically serious, and that more pathogenic and resistant VOCs may appear. There are also concerns that emerging SARS-like viruses may seed new pandemics from spillover events <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">These concerns drive a search for nAbs and vaccines that are effective against a greater diversity of sarbecoviruses. Indeed, several individual broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have now been generated either by direct isolation of bnAbs from convalescent donors or from antibody engineering of more strain-specific nAbs to generate breadth <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Ideally, large panels of bnAbs would provide more options in the use of such Abs for prophylaxis and therapy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, a range of bnAbs would allow for better definition of the requirements for neutralization breadth and more rational effective design of appropriate immunogens <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. A range of bnAbs has been crucial in germline targeting approaches to HIV vaccine design <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. Inspired by the demonstration <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup> of the strong serum nAb responses in individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then receive an mRNA vaccine, we isolated and characterized 40 bnAbs from two COVID-19 convalescent donors who were recently vaccinated, many of which combine excellent potency and breadth to sarbecoviruses. <italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation of select RBD bnAbs in a prophylaxis challenge model showed robust protection against diverse ACE2-utlizing sarbecoviruses.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Donors for bnAb isolation</title>
<p id="P4">To identify donors for bnAb isolation, we first screened sera from 3 different groups for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The groups were: i) COVID-19 convalescent donors (n = 21); ii) spike-mRNA vaccinated (2X) donors (n = 10) and iii) COVID-19 convalescent donors (n = 15) who had subsequently been mRNA vaccinated (1X) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Consistent with earlier studies, we observed significantly higher levels of plasma nAbs in donors who were previously infected and then vaccinated (“recovered-vaccinated”) compared to donors who were only infected or only vaccinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). To examine the breadth of nAb responses across these 3 groups, we tested sera for neutralization against ACE2 receptor-utilizing sarbecoviruses (Pang17, SARS-CoV-1 and WIV1) and against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Sera from recovered-vaccinated donors showed greater breadth of neutralization and more effective neutralization of VOCs than sera from donors who were only previously infected or only vaccinated. Consistent with previous studies, neutralization efficacy of recovered-vaccinated sera against VOCs was similar to that against the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Neutralization of SARS-CoV-1, whose spike is phylogenetically distinct (~15% divergent at the amino acid level) from SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>, was relatively low but was clearly above background for about half of the recovered-vaccinated donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). None of the convalescent-only or vaccinated-only donor sera could neutralize SARS-CoV-1, as also noted by us earlier <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. Of note, many of the existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive or cross-neutralizing antibodies were isolated from SARS-CoV-1 convalescent donors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup> and only more recently from SARS-CoV-2 infected donors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. BnAbs have also been isolated from SARS-CoV-2 S-protein vaccinated macaques that show serum cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup>. Hence, SARS-CoV-1/2 cross-neutralization appears to be a good indicator of the presence of pan-sarbecovirus activity and greater CoV neutralization breadth <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
</sup>. Accordingly, for isolation of bnAbs in this study, we focused on two SARS-CoV-2 infection recovered-vaccinated donors (CC25 and CC84) with the most potent SARS-CoV-1 cross-neutralizing antibody titers.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Isolation and characterization of a large panel of sarbecovirus bnAbs</title>
<p id="P5">Using SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins as baits, we sorted antigen-specific single B cells to isolate 107 mAbs from two COVID-19 recovered donors who had been recently vaccinated with the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine (CC25 (n = 56) and CC84 (n = 51)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the donors, we sorted CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup> IgG<sup>+</sup> IgM<sup>-</sup> B cells that bound to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 S-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Flow cytometry profiling of pre-vaccination (post-infection) PMBCs of CC25 and CC84 donors revealed that SARS-CoV-1/2 cross-reactive IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells were likely seeded after infection and were recalled upon vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), as also observed in other studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. Heavy (HC) and light (LC) chain sequences from 107 S-protein sorted single B cells were recovered and expressed as IgGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">All 107 mAbs exhibited cross-reactive ELISA binding to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 S-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Very few of the mAbs showed weak but detectable binding to β-HCoV (MERS-CoV HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) and α-HCoV (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E)-derived S-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). To determine the epitope specificities of the mAbs, we tested ELISA binding with SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit domains and observed that the vast majority of the mAbs (&gt;80%) displayed RBD-specific binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine the cross-reactivity of RBD binding, we investigated 12 diverse RBDs representing all the 4 major sarbecovirus clades: clades 1a, 1b, 2 and 3 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). The mAbs showed the greatest degree of cross-reactivity with clades 1a and 1b and the least with clade 2. Approximately a third of the mAbs (31%) showed cross-reactivity with all 12 RBDs derived from all 4 sarbecovirus clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Next, we evaluated cross-clade neutralization with mAb supernatants on a panel of clade 1a (SARS-CoV-1 and WIV-1) and clade 1b (SARS-CoV-2 and Pang17) pseudoviruses of ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Two-thirds of mAbs neutralized both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and 43% (40 out of 93 mAbs) neutralized all 4 sarbecoviruses in the panel and are categorized as bnAbs in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). More comprehensive and quantitative cross-neutralization is described with a smaller panel of mAbs below.</p>
<p id="P8">In terms of antibody sequences, of the 107 isolated mAbs, 93 were encoded by unique immunoglobulin germline gene combinations and 11 were expanded lineages (CC25 [n = 6] and CC84 [n = 5]) that had 2 or more clonal members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). There was a notable enrichment of IGHV3-30, particularly, and also IGHV1-46 and IGHV1-69 germline gene families for both donors as compared to human baseline germline frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>) <sup>

</sup>. Light chains of certain germline-gene families (IGKV1-33, IGKV2-30, IGLV1-40, IGLV3-21) were also modestly enriched in the isolated mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, the mAbs showed modest levels of V-gene nucleotide somatic hypermutation (SHM): for VH, median = 5.0% and for VL, median = 4.0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). As multiple studies have shown that heavy chains dominate the epitope interaction by RBD nAb <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
</sup>, we sought to determine whether the IGHV germline gene usage and/or VH SHM levels were correlated with the extent of neutralization breadth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, c-d</xref>). We observed enrichment of IGHV3-30 in mAbs that bind to clade 2 RBDs and all 12 sarbecovirus RBDs, but otherwise no notable trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2cd</xref>). VH-gene SHM levels did not distinguish potent broadly neutralizing from less broad or non-neutralizing mAbs. Overall, we observed that some IGHV or IGLV genes were enriched in bnAbs, and several human immunoglobulin gene combinations could encode for sarbecovirus bnAbs.</p>
<p id="P9">To further investigate the potential contribution of SHM to broad reactivity to sarbecoviruses, we tested the binding of mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and to monomeric RBD by BLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). We found no association of SHM with S-protein binding and a weak correlation with binding to RBD. Consistent with this lack of correlation, we did not observe any correlation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAb binding with sarbecovirus neutralization breadth or binding breadth, although some modest correlation was observed for S-protein binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). These results suggest that critical antibody paratope features for sarbecovirus breadth when targeting the sites described below may be germline-encoded and limited affinity maturation is needed. While recent findings demonstrate that the accumulation of SHM may increase potency and breadth <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
</sup>, this may not be a requisite feature of sarbecovirus bnAbs, as noted by others <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>
</sup>. The predominant use of certain germline gene segments in bnAbs suggests that a germline-targeting approach <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup> to pan-sarbecovirus vaccines may be rewarding and the relatively low levels of SHM are promising for successful vaccine deployment provided appropriate immunogens can be designed.</p>
<p id="P10">Next, we examined the CDRH3 loop lengths of the isolated Abs and observed a strong enrichment for 20- and 21-residue long CDRH3s compared to the human baseline reference database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. These long CDRH3s were found to contain high proportions of two D genes, IGH D2-15 and D3-22, that were notably enriched in bnAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Notably, 71% (12/17) of mAbs with 20 amino acid CDRH3s utilized the germline IGHD2-15 D-gene, and the majority of mAbs bearing 21-amino acid-CDRH3s utilized either the IGHD2-15 or IGHD3-22 germline D-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4</xref>). We noted that the D3-22 D-gene was also selected in bnAbs isolated in other studies <sup>

<p id="P11">Altogether, we have isolated a large panel of human sarbecovirus bnAbs. The isolated bnAbs, although encoded by several immunoglobulin germline gene families, are strongly enriched for certain germline gene features that will inform pan-sarbecovirus vaccine strategies.</p>

<title>Detailed binding and neutralization characteristics of a smaller panel of bnAbs</title>
<p id="P12">We selected 30 SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 RBD cross-reactive mAbs for more detailed characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Selection of mAbs was made based on a high degree of cross-reactive binding with RBDs of multiple sarbecovirus clades. The large panel above included nAbs that likely had more potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2 individually but lacked broad binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine sarbecovirus binding cross-reactivity more extensively, we evaluated 12 soluble monomeric RBDs representing the major sarbecovirus clades, as above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Almost all mAbs bind SARS-CoV-2 and other clade 1b-derived RBDs, with most binding in a nanomolar (nM) to picomolar (pM) KD affinity range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). The mAbs that bound most effectively to clade 1b RBDs tended to also bind well to clade 1a and clade 3 RBDs, albeit with somewhat lower affinities, yet still in the nM-pM KD affinity range. Cross-reactive binding was least to the clade 2 RBDs, although there was generally some level of reactivity and some mAbs did show high affinity binding to clade 2 RBDs. Remarkably, several mAbs showed consistently high affinity binding to RBDs from all 4 sarbecovirus clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Neutralization was investigated only for clade 1a and 1b ACE2-utilizing viruses, since neutralization assays were not available for clade 2 and 3 viruses. 22 of 30 mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with a range of IC<sub>50</sub> neutralization titers (IC<sub>50</sub> range = 0.05-4.9 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and 28 of 30 mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-1, including all mAbs that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Neutralization potency was typically stronger against SARS-CoV-1 than SARS-CoV-2. All mAbs showed neutralization against WIV1, while a majority exhibited cross-neutralization with Pang17, and to a lesser degree with SHC014. 13 out of 30 mAbs neutralized all 5 ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses tested with a geomean IC<sub>50</sub> potency of 0.12 μg/ml. The three most potent SARS-CoV-2 bnAbs, CC25.52, CC25.54 and CC25.3, neutralized all 5 ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses with geomean potencies of 0.03, 0.04 and 0.04 μg/ml, respectively. Although neutralization assays differ, this suggests they are amongst the most potent and broad individual nAbs described to date (compare also control nAbs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">We tested neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs by 20 select SARS-CoV-2 bnAbs. Consistent with the donor CC25 and CC84 sera neutralization above, the bnAbs were consistently effective against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> neutralization titers of bnAbs remained largely unchanged against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOCs but were more affected by substitutions in the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Nevertheless, IC<sub>50</sub> neutralization titers for many bnAbs were unchanged or minimally affected for the Omicron variant and remarkably 14 of 20 bnAbs retained significant neutralization against this highly evolved SARS-CoV-2 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 strain-specific nAb, CC12.1 showed substantial or complete loss of neutralization with VOCs. The results suggest that these bnAbs target more conserved RBD epitopes that are likely more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations. Overall, we have identified multiple potent sarbecoviruses bnAbs that exhibit broad reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and diverse sarbecovirus lineages.</p>

<title>Epitope specificity of sarbecovirus bnAbs</title>
<p id="P15">To help map the epitopes recognized by the sarbecovirus bnAbs, we first epitope binned them using BLI competition with RBD nAbs of known specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), including 5 human nAbs: (1) CC12.1, an RBS-A or class 1 nAb targeting the ACE2 binding site <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>; (3) CR3022, which recognizes the class 4 epitope site <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>

</sup>; and (5) DH1047, which recognizes a conserved site and is class 4 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. In addition, we included K398.22, a macaque bnAb <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>, which targets an RBD bnAb epitope distinct from that recognized by human bnAbs characterized to date but has features characteristic of class 4 bnAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). The bnAbs we describe here can be clustered for convenience into two major groups. Group-1 bnAbs strongly competed with SARS-CoV-2 class 4 human bnAbs, CR3022 and DH1047, and macaque bnAb K398.22, showed more sporadic competition with CC12.1 and did not compete with CC12.19 or S309. Group-2 mAbs competed strongly with CC12.19, weakly with macaque K398.22, and only infrequently and/or weakly with any of the other bnAbs. Group-1 bnAbs were potent and broad in neutralization against ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses, but many lineage members displayed limited binding reactivity with clade 2 sarbecovirus RBDs. The group-2 mAbs showed broader binding reactivity with sarbecoviruses but were relatively less potent compared to group-1 bnAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Notably, one group-2 bnAb, CC25.11 showed strong competition with human class 3 RBD bnAb, S309 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>, and the macaque bnAb, K398.22 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. The findings suggest that both group-1 and 2 bnAbs target more conserved RBD epitopes but group-1 bnAbs are overall more potent but less broad against clade 2 sarbecoviruses, with some exceptions.</p>
<p id="P16">To further investigate the epitopes recognized by the bnAbs, we utilized single-particle, negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) and confirmed that the 9 Group-1 and 2 Group-2 bnAb Fabs bound to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). The binding modes of bnAbs to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein were largely similar with some differences in the angles of approaches, but not distinct enough to clearly segregate group-1 epitope bnAbs. Further, structural studies that reveal molecular details of the antibody-antigen interactions contributing to the differences in the epitope recognition are important. The group-2 bnAb reconstructions are consistent with an epitope that spans the RBD, and other parts of the S-protein as described for the competitive Ab CC12.19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. These bnAb Fabs showed binding to S-protein with all three stoichiometries (Fab: trimer; 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) with some of the Fabs exhibiting destabilizing effects on the S-trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>).

<title>Immunogenetics of group 1 and 2 RBD bnAbs and vaccine targeting</title>
<p id="P17">To further understand the differences between group 1 and 2 RBD bnAbs and to determine if germline gene features can differentiate their epitope properties, we performed detailed antibody immunogenetic analysis. Both groups of RBD bnAbs were encoded by a number of IGHV germline gene families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The average CDRH3 loop lengths were significantly longer (p &lt; 0.05) in group 1 compared to group 2 RBD bnAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Notably, group 1 bnAbs strongly enriched (60%: 9 out of 15 group 1 RBD bnAbs) for IGHD3-22 germline D-gene-encoded CDRH3 “YYDxxG” motifs and possessed significantly longer CDRH3 loops (p &lt; 0.005) compared to the other mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>). The IGHD3-22 germline D-gene “YYDxxG” motif-bearing group 1 RBD bnAbs utilized several IGHV germline gene combinations and the D-gene motifs were either retained in a germline configuration (YYDSSG: CC25.48 and CC84.2) or one or both “x” residues were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>). The most common mutation was the substitution of YYD-proceeding x-residue, Serine-(S) to an Arginine-(R), which recurrently appeared in multiple YYDxxG motif bearing RBD bnAbs from both donors suggesting common B cell affinity maturation pathways. Interestingly, the S-R somatic mutation in the CDRH3 YYDxxG motif appeared to be important for resisting Omicron neutralization escape, as the non-mutated YYDxxG motif bearing group 1 RBD bnAbs failed or weakly neutralized this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Consistent with this observation, recent studies provide evidence for how YYDRxG RBD bnAbs can effectively bind to the conserved face of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>
</sup>. The findings reveal that RBD bnAbs with certain recurrent germline features can effectively resist SARS-CoV-2 Omicron escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), but several antibody solutions can counter this extreme antigenic shift and should be considered for vaccine targeting. Remarkably, in our study genetically diverse RBD bnAbs in both groups 1 and 2 were capable of effectively neutralizing the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) suggesting that several human antibody solutions can counter SARS-CoV-2 antigenic shift.</p>
<p id="P18">The association of a germline D-gene encoded motif, provides an opportunity for broad vaccine targeting, as has been described for HIV <sup>

<title>RBD bnAbs protect against challenge with diverse sarbecoviruses</title>
<p id="P19">To determine the protective efficacy of the RBD bnAbs, we conducted passive antibody transfer followed by challenge with sarbecoviruses in aged mice <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>
</sup>. We selected 3 of the broadest group-1 bnAbs, CC25.36, CC25.53 and CC25.54 and investigated their <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and SHC014 sarbecoviruses in mice. SHC014 was chosen as it encodes extensive heterogeneity in the spike RBD, reduces mRNA SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal neutralization sera titers by ~300-fold <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>
</sup> and replicates efficiently in mice <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>
</sup>. Prior to the protection studies, we compared neutralization by RBD bnAbs of replication-competent viruses with that of pseudoviruses (Extended Data Fig. S10). Neutralization of replication-competent SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 by the bnAbs was more effective (lower IC<sub>50</sub> values) than the corresponding pseudoviruses. Neutralization of replication-competent and pseudovirus versions of SHC014 by the bnAbs was approximately equivalent. The 3 RBD bnAbs, individually, or a DEN3 control antibody were administered intra-peritoneally (i.p.) at 300μg/animal into 12 groups of 10 animals (3 groups per antibody; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Each group was challenged with one of 3 mouse-adapted (MA) sarbecoviruses, (MA10 = SARS-CoV-2, MA15 = SARS-CoV or MA15-SHC = SARS-CoV MA15 - SHC014 chimera), by intranasal (i.n.) administration of virus 12h post-antibody infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The animals were monitored for signs of clinical disease due to infection, including daily weight changes, and pulmonary function. Animals in each group were euthanized at day 2 or day 4 post infection and lung tissues were collected to determine virus titers by plaque assay. Gross pathology was also assessed at the time of tissue harvest. The RBD bnAb-treated animals in all 3 sarbecoviruses challenge experiments showed significantly reduced weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b, f, j</xref>), reduced hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, g, k</xref>), and largely unaffected pulmonary function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d, h, l</xref>), as compared to the DEN3-treated control group animals, suggesting a protective role for bnAbs. We also examined virus load in the lungs at day 2 and day 4 post infection and, consistent with the above results, both the day 2 and day 4 viral titers in RBD bnAb-treated animals were substantially reduced compared to the DEN3-treated control group animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e, i, m</xref>). Overall, all 3 RBD bnAbs protected against severe sarbecoviruses disease, CC25.54 and CC25.36 bnAbs being relatively more protective than CC25.53 bnAb.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">Here, we characterized a large panel of sarbecovirus bnAbs isolated from two SARS-CoV-2 recovered-vaccinated donors. Select bnAbs showed robust <italic>in vivo</italic> protection against diverse SARS-like viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and SHC014, in a prophylaxis challenge model. The bnAbs are potent and show neutralization of a range of VOCs, and many are effective against Omicron. The bnAbs recognize a relatively conserved face of the RBD that overlaps with the footprint of a number of antibodies including ADG 61123, DH1047 and CR3022 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>
</sup> and broadly the face designated as that recognized by class 4 antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
</sup>. However, as illustrated in Fig 4, the panel of bnAbs differ in many details of recognition, for instance some compete with ACE2, others do not, and these differences are important in resistance to mutations. As variants such as Omicron emerge during this and future CoV pandemics, the availability of a selection of potent bnAbs provides choice of optimal reagents for antibody-based interventions to respond to the viral threats.</p>
<p id="P21">In terms of vaccine design, the generation of HIV immunogens typically draws heavily on the availability of multiple bnAbs to a given site to provide the best input for design strategies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>
</sup>. The same consideration is likely to apply to pan-sarbecovirus vaccine design. Further, although the bnAbs that we isolated were encoded by several gene families, certain V and D gene families were highly enriched. We confirmed and identified specific antibody germline gene features associated with broad activity against diverse sarbecoviruses and vaccine design strategies may seek to target these genetic features by rationally designed prophylactic vaccines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>
</sup>. Some of the most potent bnAbs compete with the immunodominant human SARS-CoV-2 RBS-A/class 1 nAb CC12.1 that shows relatively low cross-reactivity. Elicitation of nAbs like CC12.1 may then reduce the elicitation of bnAbs, and rational vaccine design modalities may need to mask RBS-A/class 1 immunodominant sites <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>
</sup> whilst leaving the bnAb sites intact. Resurfaced RBD-based immunogens in various flavors <sup>

</sup> may achieve a similar goal.</p>
<p id="P22">Given the strong bnAb responses induced through infection-vaccination as indicated from serum studies and by our mAbs, are there lessons here for vaccine design? The higher frequency of bnAbs in infection-vaccination may have a number of causes. First, the spike S-protein may have subtle conformational differences, particularly in the sites targeted by bnAbs, between the native structure on virions and the stabilized form presented by mRNA immunization. This may favor the activation of bnAbs in the infection step followed by recall during mRNA boosting. Second, the long time-lag between infection and vaccination may have favored the accumulation of key mutations associated with bnAbs. There is evidence that intact HIV virions can be maintained on follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers over long time-periods in a mouse model <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>
</sup>. Third, T cell help provided by the infection may be superior to that provided by mRNA vaccination alone. Overall, there is an intriguing possibility that pan-sarbecovirus nAb activity may be best achieved by a hybrid approach <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup> to immunization that seeks to mimic infection-vaccination, once the key contributing factors to breadth development in that approach can be determined. However, we also note that a very recent report, published as a resubmission of this manuscript was prepared, describes bnAbs arising from a third immunization with an inactivated vaccine <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P23">In summary, we isolated multiple potent sarbecovirus protective cross-neutralizing human antibodies and provide a molecular basis for broad neutralization. The bnAbs identified may themselves have prophylactic utility and the bnAb panel delineates the boundaries and requirements for broad neutralization and will be an important contributor to rational vaccine design.</p>

<p id="P25">To generate soluble S ectodomain proteins from SARS-CoV-1 (residues 1-1190; GenBank: AAP13567) and SARS-CoV-2 (residues 1-1208; GenBank: MN908947), we constructed the expression plasmids by synthesizing the DNA fragments from GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned them into the phCMV3 vector (Genlantis, USA). To keep the soluble S proteins in a stable trimeric prefusion state, the following changes in the constructs were made: double proline substitutions (2P) were introduced in the S2 subunit; the furin cleavage sites (in SARS-CoV-2 residues 682−685, and in SARS-CoV-1 residues 664−667) were replaced by “GSAS” linker; the trimerization motif T4 fibritin was incorporated at the C-terminus of the S proteins. To purify and biotinylate the spike proteins, the HRV-3C protease cleavage site, 6x HisTag, and AviTag spaced by GS-linkers were added to the C-terminus after the trimerization motif. To produce truncated proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike, the PCR amplifications of the gene fragments encoding SARS-CoV-1 RBD (residue 307-513), SARS-CoV-2 NTD (residue 1-290), RBD (residue 320-527), RBD-SD1 (residue 320-591), and RBD-SD1-2 (residue 320-681) subdomains were carried out using the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 plasmids as templates. To generate pseudoviruses of non-human sarbecoviruses, the DNA fragments encoding the spikes of the sarbecoviruses without the ER retrieval signal were codon-optimized and synthesized at GeneArt (Life Technologies). The spike encoding genes of Pang17 (residues 1-1249, GenBank: QIA48632.1), WIV1 (residues 1-1238, GenBank: KF367457) and SHC014 (residue 1-1238, GenBank: AGZ48806.1) were constructed into the phCMV3 vector (Genlantis, USA) using the Gibson assembly (NEB, E2621L) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To express the monomeric RBDs of sarbecovirus clades (clades, 1b, 1a, 2 and 3), the conserved region aligning to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residue 320-527) were constructed into phCMV3 vector with 6x HisTag, and AviTag spaced by GS-linkers on C-terminus. The sarbecovirus RBD genes encoding RaTG13 (residues 320-527, GenBank: QHR63300.2), Pang17 (residues 318-525, GenBank: QIA48632.1), WIV1 (residues 308-514, GenBank: KF367457), RsSHC014 (residues 308-514, GenBank: AGZ48806.1), BM-4831 (residues 311-514, NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_014470.1), BtKY72 (residues 310-516, GenBank: KY352407), RmYN02 (residues 299-487, GSAID EPI_ISL_412977), Rf1 (residues 311-499, GenBank: DQ412042.1), Rs4081 (residues 311-499, GenBank: KY417143.1) and Yun11 (residues 311-499, GenBank: JX993988) were synthesized at GeneArt (Life Technologies) and constructed using the Gibson assembly (NEB, E2621L).</p>

<title>Biotinylation of proteins</title>
<p id="P30">To randomly biotinylate the proteins described in this paper, we used an EZ-Link NHS-PEG Solid-Phase Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Scientific #21440). To dissolve the reagents supplied in the kit for stock solutions, 10 μL DMSO was added into each tube. To make a working solution, 1 μL stock solution was diluted by 170 μL water freshly before use. To concentrate the proteins before biotinylation, the proper sized filter Amicon tubes were used. The proteins were adjusted to 7-9 mg/mL in PBS. For each 30 μL aliquoted protein, 3 μL of working solution was added and mixed thoroughly following by a 3h incubation on ice. To stop the reaction and remove the free NHS-PEG4-Biotin, the protein solution was buffer exchanged into PBS using Amicon tubes. All proteins were evaluated by BioLayer Interferometry after biotinylation.</p>

All samples were diluted in Octet buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for a final concertation of 10 μg/mL for mAbs and 200 nM for viral proteins. For supernatant mAb binding screening, 125 μL of expression supernatant was used. For binding assays, antibodies were captured for 60 s and transferred to buffer for an additional 60 s. Captured antibodies were dipped into viral proteins for 120 s in order to obtain an association signal. For dissociation, biosensors were moved to Octet buffer only for an additional 240 s for the dissociation step. The data generated was analyzed using the ForteBio Data Analysis software for correction, and the kinetic curves were fit to 1:1 binding mode. Note that the IgG: spike protomer binding can be a mixed population of 2:1 and 1:1, such that the term ‘apparent affinity’ dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>

<title>Isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)</title>
<p id="P33">To isolate antigen-specific memory B cells, we used SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as probes to perform single cell sorting in a 96-well format. PBMCs from post-infection vaccinated human donors were stained with fluorophore labeled antibodies and spike proteins. To generate spike probes, streptavidin-AF647 (Thermo Fisher S32357) was coupled to BirA biotinylated SARS-CoV-1 spike. Streptavidin-AF488 (Thermo Fisher S32354) and streptavidin-BV421 (BD Biosciences 563259) were coupled to BirA biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike separately. The conjugation reaction was carried freshly before use with spike protein versus streptavidin-fluorophores at 2:1 or 4:1 molecular ratio. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the conjugated spike proteins were stored on ice or at 4 °C for up to 1 week. To prepare PBMCs, the frozen PBMCs were thawed in 10mL recover medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 50% FBS) immediately before staining. The cells were washed with 10mL FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA) and each 10 million cells were resuspended in 100μL of FACS buffer. To isolate SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgG+ B cells, PBMCs were stained for CD3 (APC Cy7, BD Pharmingen #557757), CD4 (APC-Cy7, Biolegend, #317418), CD8 (APC-Cy7, BD Pharmingen #557760), CD14 (APC-H7, BD Pharmingen #561384, clone M5E2), CD19 (PerCP-Cy5.5, Biolegend, #302230, clone HIB19), CD20 (PerCP-Cy5.5, Biolegend, #302326, clone 2H7), IgG (BV786, BD Horizon, #564230, Clone G18-145) and IgM (PE, Biolegend, #314508, clone MHM-88). Antibodies were incubated with PBMCs on ice for 15 min. After the 15 min staining, SARS-CoV-1-S-AF647, SARS-CoV-2-S-AF488, and SARS-CoV-2-S-BV421 were added to the PBMC solution incubating on ice. After another 30 min incubation, FVS510 Live/Dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L34966) 1:1000 diluted with FACS buffer was added to the PBMC solution for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with 10 mL ice cold FACS buffer. Each 10 million cells were resuspended with 500μL FACS buffer and then filtered through 70um nylon mesh FACS tube caps (Fisher Scientific, #08-771-23). A BD FACSMelody sorter (BRV 9 Color Plate 4way) was used for the single cell sorting process. To isolate cross-reactive B cells, the gating strategy was set as follows: lymphocytes (SSC-A vs. FSC-A) and singlets (FSC-H vs. FSC-A) were gated first, and then live cells were selected by FVS510 Live/Dead negative gating. B cells were identified as CD19+CD20+CD3-CD4-CD8-CD14-IgM-IgG+ live singlets. Cross-reactive S-protein specific B cells were sequentially selected for SARS-CoV-2-S-BV421/SARS-CoV-2-S-AF488 double positivity and SARS-CoV-1-S-AF647/SARS-CoV-2-S-AF488 double positivity. Single cells were sorted into 96-well plates on a cooling platform. To prevent degradation of mRNA, plates were moved onto dry ice immediately after sorting. Reverse transcription was done right after. Superscript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), dNTPs (Thermo Fisher), random hexamers (Gene Link), Ig gene-specific primers, DTT, and RNAseOUT (Thermo Fisher), and Igepal (Sigma) were used in the reverse transcription PCR reaction as described previously <sup>

Stable cell lines with consistent and high hACE2 expression levels were established as HeLa-hACE2 and used in the pseudovirus neutralization assay. To calculate the neutralization efficiency of the sera or mAbs, the samples were 3-fold serially diluted and 25 μL of each dilution was incubated with 25 μL of pseudovirus at 37 °C for 1 h in 96-half area well plates (Corning, 3688). Just before the end of the incubation, HeLa-hACE2 cells were suspended with culture medium at a concentration of 2 x 10<sup>5</sup>/mL. The DEAE-dextran (Sigma, # 93556-1G) was added to the cell solutions at 20 μg/mL. 50 μL of the cell solution was distributed into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and the neutralization efficiency was calculated by measuring the luciferase levels in the HeLa-hACE2 cells. After removal of the supernatant, the HeLa-hACE2 cells were lysed by luciferase lysis buffer (25 mM Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 10-20 mins. After adding Bright-Glo (Promega, PRE2620) to each well, luciferase activity was inspected by a luminometer.

<title>Prophylactic treatment of aged mice with RBD bnAbs protects against challenge with diverse SARS-like viruses.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>, Three RBD bnAbs (CC25.54, CC25.36 and CC25.53) individually, or a dengue DEN3 control antibody were administered intra-peritoneally (i.p.) at 300μg per animal into 12 groups of aged mice (10 animals per group).
