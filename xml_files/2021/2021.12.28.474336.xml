<abstract>
<p id="P1">COVID-19 has forced rapid clinical translation of novel vaccine technologies, principally mRNA vaccines, that have resulted in meaningful efficacy and adequate safety in response to the global pandemic. Notwithstanding this success, there remains an opportunity for innovation in vaccine technology to address current limitations and meet the challenges of inevitable future pandemics. We describe a universal vaccine cell (UVC) rationally designed to mimic the natural physiologic immunity induced post viral infection of host cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells were CRISPR engineered to delete MHC-I expression and simultaneously overexpress a NK Ligand adjuvant to increase rapid cellular apoptosis which was hypothesized to enhance viral antigen presentation in the resulting immune microenvironment leading to a protective immune response. Cells were further engineered to express the parental variant WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a representative viral antigen prior to irradiation and cryopreservation. The cellular vaccine was then used to immunize non-human primates in a standard 2-dose, IM injected prime + boost vaccination with 1e8 cells per 1 ml dose resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses (1e3 nAb titers) with decreasing levels at 6 months duration. Similar titers generated in this established NHP model have translated into protective human neutralizing antibody levels in SARS-Cov-2 vaccinated individuals. Animals vaccinated with WA1/2020 spike antigens were subsequently challenged with 1.0 ร 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> infectious Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 in a heterologous challenge which resulted in an approximately 3-log order decrease in viral RNA load in the lungs. These heterologous viral challenge results reflect the ongoing real-world experience of original variant WA1/2020 spike antigen vaccinated populations exposed to rapidly emerging variants like Delta and now Omicron. This cellular vaccine is designed to be a rapidly scalable cell line with a modular poly-antigenic payload to allow for practical, large-scale clinical manufacturing and use in an evolving viral variant environment. Human clinical translation of the UVC is being actively explored for this and potential future pandemics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for new innovations in vaccinology to enable the rapid development of novel vaccines against emerging viral variants that engender robust and long-lasting immune protection. The unprecedented success of both mRNA and adenoviral vaccines have established the capability of a rapid global vaccination program<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. However, the waning antibody responses seen with these emergency-use authorized vaccine technologies, and the need for vaccine boosters, has highlighted the requirement for further improvements in vaccine approaches to drive higher, longer-lasting protective immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. The newly emerging viral variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the evident reduced efficacy of the existing vaccines to protect against transmissible and symptomatic infection of these variants, also highlights the need for vaccines that can ideally deliver multiple variant antigens (polyvalency) and be rapidly manufactured at scale as soon as new viral variants are discovered<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Theoretically, an ideal vaccine technology would have four core attributes, namely: hyper-immunity, self-adjuvancy, polyvalency and scalability. The first hyper-immunity is self-evident and speaks to the requirement of generating a robust humoral neutralizing antibody, and ideally a subsequent T cell amnestic response, such that protection remains durable. Self-adjuvancy, or conversely the absence of the need for exogenous excipients to elicit a hyper-immune response may prove to be a meaningful innovation in that the immune side-effects of current vaccines may be mediated by the non-target antigen specific adjuncts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Thirdly, polyvalency or the ability to protect against multiple immunodominant epitopes, is a core feature of overlapping and orthogonal mechanisms of protection and is a core principle or antibiotic and antiviral therapy in infection to suppress underlying pathogenic genetic drift and mutation and acquired resistance<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Lastly, scalability or the ability to deliver preventative doses of vaccines in an economic, large scale and clinically relevant fashion in both the developed and developing worlds, is a <italic>sine qua non</italic> of any human vaccine.</p>
<p id="P4">Current mRNA, protein, and viral vector-based vaccines have certain limitations, such as their requirement for excipient adjuvants to activate the recipient immune system, or to deliver the viral antigenic payload<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. These include the artificial lipid nanoparticles delivering the mRNA, or MF59, AS03, Alum, ISCOMATRIX, and Matrix-M chemical emulsions for example, or the adenoviral protein antigens themselves that stimulate innate immune cell activation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Adjuvants are required to increase the effectiveness of vaccines and their use can cause side-effects including local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and systemic reactions (fever, chills, and body aches). Furthermore, there have been modest but real morbidity and rare mortality associated with Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) and Myocarditis, secondary to the current COVID-19 vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">The size constraint of the adenoviral vector genome, and the limited length of stable mRNA that can be produced and packaged into nanoparticles, restricts the number and size of nucleic acid-encoded antigens and epitopes that can be delivered in these vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Thus, these vaccines are constrained in their ability to provide multiple immunodominant proteins to address emerging pandemic variants, or to easily combine multiple pathogens into one vaccine.</p>
<p id="P6">To address some of the current limitations of vaccine technologies, we have developed a novel vaccine platform based on a CRISPR genetically engineered human stem cell, termed the Universal Vaccine Cell (UVC). The principal feature of this vaccine platform is to attempt to reproduce physiologic immunity that is engendered naturally through lytic viral infection and the resulting apoptosis of primary human cells. The platform is designed to deliver an almost unlimited antigenic payload within the context of a physiological apoptotic environment, to both release abundant antigen and simultaneously stimulate the host immune response. Here, we use the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a rigorous and timely test platform, to demonstrate that this self-adjuvanting, polyvalent UVC, can generate a robust and antigen-specific humoral immune response in vaccinated macaques. This hyper-immunogenic vaccine resulted in reduced viral loads in animals challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variant, which recapitulates the current experience of a population vaccinated against the initial parental WA1/2020 variant, yet now exposed to novel variants like Delta and Omicron<sup>

<title>Genetic engineering of iPS cells to create a cellular vaccine to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen</title>
<p id="P7">To create a cellular vaccine platform to deliver abundant viral antigens and simultaneously engage host innate immune cells to present these antigens to lymphocytes, we attempted to create a cell with a hyper-immunogenic phenotype. We selected human iPS cells as the UVC cell line due to their stable genetics, non-transformed phenotype, ease of genetic engineering and capacity for rapid scalable propagation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. IPS cells also retained the unique ability for programmable differentiation into any cell lineage, thus retaining the future opportunity to explore differentiation of the UVC into different cell types that may have enhanced immunogenic properties<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">We first genetically engineered iPS cells to create an immunogenic phenotype by stable integration of the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike antigen into the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We selected the original and well-characterized WA1/2020 variant of SARS-CoV-2 and spike antigen sequence with mutation of the furin cleavage site and proline-stabilizing mutations that is identical to that in the current emergency-use authorized vaccines being deployed globally to vaccinate against COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). By including the spike transmembrane domain sequence in the gene encoding this antigen, we were able to detect high levels of the viral spike on the cell surface of the engineered iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Spike protein was also readily observed in engineered cell lysates when measured by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The yield of antigen released upon lysis was quantified using a spike-specific ELISA assay and we observed an abundant and dose-dependent release of protein from the cells, which would equate to approximately ห20 micrograms of spike antigen protein delivered in a 1x10<sup>8</sup> cell vaccine dose of UVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To ensure robust delivery of this immunodominant antigen to the recipient immune system, we incorporate an apoptosis-inducing lethal irradiation step during vaccine manufacture by exposing the UVC cells to a 10 Gy dose of gamma radiation prior to cryopreservation and vaccination. Thus, when subjects are immunized with the UVC, we reasoned that the cells would undergo apoptosis and release the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen into the immune microenvironment via production of apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In theory, these apoptotic bodies will be phagocytosed by innate immune cells and antigen-presenting cells and presented to T and B lymphocytes to generate a spike antigen-specific immune response.</p>
<p id="P10">In addition to creating a mechanism for delivery of immunogenic antigens via apoptotic bodies, the irradiation of the UVC can be considered a safety feature as it renders the cells unable to proliferation or persist <italic>in vivo</italic> upon vaccination. In support of this, we observed a robust elevation in the proportion of apoptotic cells after 24 and 72 hours of culture of irradiated UVC, both using apoptotic dyes and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) and by observation of cell morphology under the microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Furthermore, unlike non-irradiated UVC, irradiation prevented any detectible proliferation of the cells over 72-hours in culture as measured by proliferation dyes using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Incorporation of NK cell activation signals by genetic engineering to create a self-adjuvanting vaccine cell</title>
<p id="P11">In addition to the proposed immunogenicity expected from apoptosis and release of immunogenic antigens upon vaccination, we attempted to increase the immunogenic potential further and incorporate a self-adjuvanting phenotype to the UVC. As a form of physiological cell death, apoptosis is generally non-inflammatory<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, to promote effective local inflammation and engage the innate immune system that can mobilize effector cells, we engineered the UVC to mimic a virally infected cell to be recognized and rapidly lysed by host innate immune cells, principally NK cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Many viruses attempt to evade immune recognition by limiting MHC-I cell surface expression to reduce the presentation of viral antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. This โmissing-selfโ signal can aid in the activation of NK calls and promote cytolysis, and therefore the iPS cells were engineered to completely remove MHC-I molecules from the cell surface via CRISPR knockout of the ฮฒ2 microglobulin (B2M) gene, a critical component of MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">
<italic>In vivo</italic>, lack of MHC-I on the target cell is not sufficient to trigger full NK cell activation alone and a further hallmark of cells undergoing stress or viral infection, is the expression of NK cell activating natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands on their cell surface<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, we further engineered the UVC using CRISPR to integrate a gene expression cassette in a safe-harbor locus to drive constitutive expression of the human MICA gene (MHC class I polypeptideโrelated sequence A), a potent activator of NK cells. Using flow cytometry, abundant levels of MICA could be detected on the surface of the engineered UVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Rapid growth kinetics of engineered UVC</title>
<p id="P13">Prior to irradiation and cryopreservation of the UVC ready for immunization, we evaluated the growth kinetics of the cells to confirm the capacity for rapid, scalable proliferation that would be needed for a vaccine technology to address the needs of a pandemic. IPS cells are known to have a relatively short doubling times in the range of 18-20 hours<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>, and we observed similar kinetics with an average exponential growth of &gt;50-fold over a 7-day culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Thus, from a starting UVC number of 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells, the vaccine can be theoretically expanded to provide millions of doses in under 8 weeks, and even quicker if adapted to bioreactor manufacturing.</p>
<p id="P14">The consistent rapid cell growth of the UVC and the morphological similarity to unmodified iPS cells, suggested the UVC reattained broad characteristic of the iPS cells from which they are derived. We thus assessed the stem cell characteristics of the UVC after genetic engineering and rapid expansion to confirm that the cells have retained their original stemness-gene expression signatures without acquiring any detectible or obvious changes in phenotype beyond those introduced by genetic engineering. The expanded UVC expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, human MICA ligand and CRISPR knockout of B2M, showed a similar level of expression of three important pluripotent transcription factors, NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2, suggesting they have retained a stem-cell like transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). Engineered UVC also showed similar expression to control iPS cells for genes (DNC, Vimentin, HES5 and GATA6) that are known to increase in expression as iPS cells differentiate into mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm liniage, confirming the UVC have a consistent undifferentiated, iPS cell gene expression profile, morphology, and growth characteristics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p id="P15">Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CRISPR engineered UVC has the capacity to deliver abundant, full-length spike protein antigen in the context of an irradiated, apoptotic cellular vehicle. Via the genetically engineered absence of MHC-I and overexpression of MICA, the UVC has the potential for NK cell activation upon immunization, which may remove the need for excipient adjuvants to promote inflammation and immunogenicity. We first tested this hypothesis <italic>in vitro</italic> to measure the activation of NK cells by the UVC and the NK-mediated UVC cytolysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Human and primate NK cell cytolysis of universal vaccine cells</title>
<p id="P16">To further explore the impact of MHC-I loss and overexpression of NK cell ligands on recognition and killing of the UVC by NK cells, we performed a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> NK cell activation and cytolysis assays. When MHC-I was removed via B2M knockout alone, the UVC were robustly killed by human NK cells, which increased in an E:T ratio-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We compared the level of UVC cytolysis to that observed with the MHC-deficient K562 leukemia cell line, known to be potent targets for NK cell killing, and found a similar level of cytolysis confirming the MHC-I deficient UVC are readily targeted by NK cells. We extended this analysis to macaque NK cells and found that while control iPS cells (expressing MHC-I) show low levels of killing, the MHC-I Knockout UVC were lysed more readily by the NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">To assess the relative contribution of overexpressing NK activating ligands on UVC cytolysis by macaque NK cells, we performed an analysis of UVC cells transiently overexpressing different NKG2D ligands, including MICA, MICB and UL16 binding protein 1 (ULBP1). While the levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1ฮฒ (MIP-1ฮฒ) was significantly elevated when MICA was overexpressed, proinflammatory and activation markers for NK cells were generally the same regardless of ligand overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). With stable overexpression of MICA by CRISPR engineering, we confirmed a significant increase in total responding macaque NK cells and a significant elevation in MIP-1ฮฒ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Collectively these data demonstrate robust cytolysis of the UVC by both human and non-human primate NK cells and show the potent impact of loss of MHC-I on NK cell-mediated lysis. We hypothesized that overexpression of the NK cell activating ligand MICA, in combination with loss of MHC-I, would lead to robust recognition and activation of NK cells <italic>in vivo</italic> upon immunization and enable delivery of the vaccine antigen and engender a potent immune response in the absence of any adjuvant. We thus moved to non-human primate immunization studies to investigate further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Immunogenicity of universal vaccine cells in vaccinated macaques</title>
<p id="P19">To evaluate the immunogenicity of the UVC and the vaccineโs ability to engender a humoral immune response, we immunized cynomolgus macaques and followed the production of neutralizing and spike-specific antibodies over a 10-week period, and a duration follow up at 6 months. We immunized 9 macaques, aged 6-12 years old, with either 1x10<sup>7</sup> UVC (<italic>n</italic>=3) or 1x10<sup>8</sup> UVC (<italic>n</italic>=3) expressing the WA1/2020 SARS-COV-2 spike antigen, and sham controls (<italic>n</italic>=3). Macaques received a prime dose immunization by the intramuscular route without adjuvant at week 0, followed by a boost dose immunization (same cell number as prime dose) at week 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Neutralizing antibody responses were assessed using a pseudovirus neutralization assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>, and we observed neutralizing antibodies in all UVC vaccinated macaques at week 2 that further increased by week 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The higher dose of 1x10<sup>8</sup> UVC resulted in the most robust titers of neutralizing antibodies at all timepoints tested. Following UVC boost dose immunization at week 6, neutralizing antibody titers elevated further, reaching close to 1x10<sup>3</sup> titers with the higher 1x10<sup>8</sup> cell dose. Six months after the initial UVC immunization, neutralizing antibody showed a durable response, and levels in macaques immunized with the 1x10<sup>8</sup> UVC dose remained elevated beyond that seen with the initial prime UVC dose. We also observed robust spike-specific and receptor-binding-domain (RBD)-specific antibody titers, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in vaccinated macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). These antibody responses and durability at 6 months in the 1x10<sup>8</sup> dose, were like those seen with the neutralizing antibody titers, and thus collectively demonstrating that the UVC vaccine can engender a robust humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen with demonstrable durability. At 6 months after immunization, detectible levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta and Delta were also observed, albeit lower than seen with the immunizing antigen variant WA1/2020 spike, suggesting humoral immunity is also generated against SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This prompted us to assess the protective immunity of the humoral immune response generated by UVC immunization in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 heterologous infection challenge.</p>

<title>Humoral immune responses in vaccinated macaques after heterologous SARS-CoV-2 challenge</title>
<p id="P20">In a second non-human primate study, we immunized rhesus macaques, aged 6-12 years old, with the higher 1x10<sup>8</sup> dose of UVC (<italic>n</italic>=6) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 spike antigen, and sham controls (<italic>n</italic>=6), and this time followed the production of neutralizing and spike-specific antibodies over an 8-week period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). At week 8, the macaques were challenged with 1.0 ร 10<sup>5</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of heterologous SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) by the intranasal and intratracheal routes<sup>

</sup>. Viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs were assessed over 10-days by reverse transcription PCR (RTโPCR) specific for subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA), which is thought to measure replicating virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Sham controls showed a median peak of 5.39 (range 4.60โ5.88) log<sub>10</sub>[sgRNA (copies per ml)] in BAL samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b and d</xref>). Partial protection was observed in macaques immunized with the UVC as a significantly lower level of virus was detected in BAL samples, with a median peak of 2.78 (range 1.70โ4.63) log<sub>10</sub>[sgRNA (copies per ml)], representing a 2.81 log reduction in virus in UVC vaccinated animals. A significant reduction in virus (0.96 log reduction) was also observed in nasal swabs from UVC immunized macaques when compared to sham controls, albeit lower in magnitude than seen when comparing BAL samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c and e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">While neutralizing antibody titers specific for the WA1/2020 variant spike was high in both macaque immunization studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and supplementary Fig. S2), the titers specific for other SARS-CoV-2 variants (Beta and Delta) was lower, which is to be expected given the divergence in antigen protein sequence. Thus, the partial protection seen in animals immunized with WA1/2020 spike UVC and challenged with B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2, is also expected given the heterologous nature of the challenge. We would predict a more robust and complete reduction in virus from animals immunized with UVC and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 in which the antigen and variant are matched.</p>
<p id="P22">Collectively these data demonstrate that a prime and boost dose of 1x10<sup>8</sup> WA1/2020 Spike expressing UVC promote a robust antigen-specific antibody response with levels of neutralizing antibodies and durability similar to the current approved COVID-19 vaccines<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P23">The urgent global need for improved vaccine technologies to meet future pandemics is driving a renaissance of innovation in vaccinology. COVID-19 has demonstrated the rapid pace at which viral mutations can accumulate and new variants emerge that can escape the protective efficacy of existing vaccines designed against earlier viral antigen sequences<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. To address the need for novel vaccine technologies, we have developed the first cellular vaccine, to generate hyper-immunity via self-adjuvancy through apoptosis and NK cell-mediated cytolysis within the immune microenvironment.</p>
<p id="P24">Our data demonstrate that the UVC vaccine platform can induce robust neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated macaques when delivering the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 (original variant<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>) full-length membrane-bound Spike protein, with mutation of the furin cleavage site and two proline-stabilizing mutations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. The antibody titers and resulting immunogenicity were on par with the neutralizing antibody titers demonstrating immune protection with the emergency use authorized and now commercially available mRNA vaccines (1e3 nAb titer)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. We also show that the UVC delivering the WA1/2020 Spike antigen enhances neutralizing antibodies and (RBD)-specific binding antibodies specific for the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.351 (Beta) variants of SARS-CoV-2. This robust and specific humoral response can partially protect rhesus macaques vaccinated with a prime and boost dose of WA1/2020 Spike UVC in a <italic>heterologous</italic> variant challenge with infectious B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 and engender a more rapid clearance of viral RNA in the BAL. A limitation of the WA1/2020 UVC in a Delta heterologous challenge was the absence of any meaningful protection in nasal swabs. This discordance between vaccine variant, versus virus variant, is the principal challenge facing current vaccinated populations and might suggest the reason for ongoing infectious spread but more limited morbidity and mortality against these emerging variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">As regards duration of protection, the theoretical hyper-immunity postulated by creating a self-adjuvanting, hyper-immune UVC established robust initial nAb titers. When these animals were rechallenged 6-month later, the nAb response stayed robust at the higher, and now established for clinical use, 1e8 UVC dose. Moreover, the persistent nAb response at 6-months remained robust for SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Beta and Delta variants.</p>
<p id="P26">As regards intrinsic safety, the UVC undergoes lethal irradiation during manufacture and rapid apoptosis in the immune microenvironment upon vaccination. This is the principal mechanism of efficacy of the UVC, and fortunately its most redeeming safety feature, by virtue of the impossibility of <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence and teratogenicity of the cellular antigen carrier. The irradiation-induced apoptosis is further enhanced by CRISPR genetic engineering to remove MHC-I expression and introduce cell surface expression of the NKG2D ligand MICA, making the UVC potent targets for host NK cells. Recruited NK cells will likely recognize the UVC as virally infected cell through MHC-I absence and MICA activation of NKG2D signaling to mediate a direct killing effect and release of protein antigen<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. The apoptosis and NK-mediated cytolysis enables the UVC to be a self-adjuvanting vaccine vector, without the need for additional chemicals adjuvants or additional foreign antigens. Thus, the UVC may mimic the physiological engagement of the immune system typical of virally infective cells within the tissues of an individual suffering with the disease. The use of a living cellular antigen vehicle, as opposed to a lipid nanoparticle or other such inanimate construct, can potentially recapitulate natural immunity without the need for exogenous adjuvants, which may portend greater safety against autoimmune complications. Theoretically, and unproven and unprovable at this time absent human clinical data, the natural physiologic nature may lead to an improved safety profile for the UVC.</p>
<p id="P27">The CRISPR genetic engineering to render the UVC highly immunogenic and self-adjuvanting, also presents a unique opportunity to address antigen polyvalency. Unlike mRNA or DNA vaccines, or recombinant, replication-incompetent viral vector vaccines, that have a size limit of encoded antigen or the number of independent antigens they can deliver, the UVC can be engineered to express and deliver a much higher number of full-length protein antigens. Thus, there is the ability to create polyvalency against multiple epitopes in a rapid modular gene cassette fashion through CRISPR engineering of the iPS cell genome.</p>
<p id="P28">A perceived limitation of the UVC technology may be the seemingly complex and costly nature of developing and manufacturing a live human cell as a vector for vaccination at scale. However, the UVC is a cell line, not a complex cell therapy, and can thus be scaled within appropriate parameters for such a biologic agent. Once pathogen antigens have be genetically engineered, the UVC cell line can be expanded rapidly to scale with predictable growth kinetics and QA/QC controls. The modular nature of the UVC and the ability to integrate emerging viral antigens into the cellular genome using CRISPR, can allow scalable manufacture of new polyvalent vaccines to address emerging variants. In fact, the genetic engineering of the UVC cells can be accomplished in a matter of weeks prior to exponential cell culture expansion to create millions of clinical doses. As a test of the rapid and modular manufacturing of the platform, at the time of this publication, the authors have begun engineering a polyvalent UVC against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">A limitation of our study is that we have yet to observe the generation of a robust T cell response in vaccinated animals. To put this into broader clinical context, the measurable albeit modest CD8-specific T cell responses seen with the adenoviral and mRNA vaccines have not resulted in nAb titers and duration of protection longer than 6-9 months<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup>. One potential hypothesis to begin to establish a clinically meaningful amnestic T cell response is to explore novel non-spike antigens, thus leveraging the simultaneous polyvalency of the UVC platform. The UVC allows vaccination with multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including immunodominant T cell epitopes such as those in the nucleocapsid and viral accessory proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. In the context of COVID-19, additional studies will evaluate the capability of UVCs delivering polyvalent T cell epitopes such as the Nucleocapsid, ORF and Membrane proteins, to generate a CD8 cytolytic and CD4 Helper T cell response in vaccinated macaques to engender duration of protection via T cell amnestic response. Beyond COVID-19, the potential of the theoretically unlimited antigenic payload of a cellular vaccine would allow for โpoly-pathogenic polyvalencyโ and the creation of a single seasonal respiratory vaccine, which could include influenza, RSV, and pan-coronavirus viral antigens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">In summary, these data establish the first cellular vaccine platform and demonstrate that immunization with a WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing UVC vaccine elicits robust neutralizing antibody titers and provides partial protection against heterologous Delta SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Establishing this novel cellular vaccine platform technology within the rigorous and timely setting of COVID-19, the UVC may portend a novel class of gene and cell therapy prophylaxis for potential future viral pandemics.</p>

The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using a VersaMax or Omega microplate reader. ELISA endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance &gt;0.2. The log<sub>10</sub>(endpoint titers) are reported.</p>

<title>Pseudovirus neutralization assay</title>
<p id="P46">The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus expressing a luciferase reporter gene were generated in a similar approach to that previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. In brief, the packaging construct psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program), luciferase reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), and spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 SฮCT were co-transfected into HEK293T cells with calcium phosphate. The supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were collected 48 hours after transfection; pseudotype viruses were purified by filtration with 0.45-ฮผm filter. To determine the neutralization activity of the antisera from vaccinated macaques, HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.75 ร 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well overnight. Twofold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were prepared and mixed with 50 ฮผl of pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated at 37 ยฐC for 1 hour before adding to HEK293T-hACE2 cells. After 48 hours, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturerโs instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in relative light units was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p id="P47">Statistical differences between two sample groups, where appropriate, were analyzed by a standard Studentโs two-tailed, non-paired, t-test and between three or more sample groups using two-way or three-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 9. Analysis of virological data was performed using two-sided MannโWhitney tests. Correlations were assessed by two-sided Spearman rank-correlation tests. P values are included in the figures or referred to in the legends where statistical analyses have been carried out. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
