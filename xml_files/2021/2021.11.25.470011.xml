<p id="P1">Treatment with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contributes to COVID-19 management. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 variants can escape several of these recently approved mAbs, highlighting the need for additional discovery and development. In a convalescent COVID-19 patient, we identified six mAbs, classified in four epitope groups, that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, alpha, beta, gamma and delta infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. In hamsters, mAbs 3E6 and 3B8 potently cured infection with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, beta and delta when administered post-viral infection at 5 mg/kg. Even at 0.2 mg/kg, 3B8 still reduced viral titers. Intramuscular delivery of DNA-encoded 3B8 resulted in <italic>in vivo</italic> mAb production of median serum levels up to 90 μg/ml, and protected hamsters against delta infection. Overall, our data mark 3B8 as a promising candidate against COVID-19, and highlight advances in both the identification and gene-based delivery of potent human mAbs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in an unprecedented global health and economic crisis and has already caused more than 5 million deaths worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 consists of an S1 subunit that recognizes host cell receptors and an S2 subunit that promotes membrane fusion of virus and host cells. Within the S1 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) is responsible for interaction with receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells to mediate viral entry. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Antibodies can be elicited by natural infection and vaccination, or can be administered as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a passive immunization strategy. Although vaccines are essential tools to fight this pandemic, therapeutic modalities, including mAbs, can also play a crucial role. This is especially the case for (immune-compromised or elderly) individuals who may not generate a robust response to their vaccine, cannot be vaccinated, are at high risk for severe illness or are still awaiting their vaccine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Recent advances in mAb discovery, combined with the favorable safety profile and clinical experience, make these ideal molecules for such deployment. As of November 2021, four human mAb treatments have received (emergency use) authorization: REGN-COV2 (i.e. REGN10933 + REGN10987) from Regeneron (in the US and Europe), LY-CoV555 with/without LY-CoV016 from AbCellera/Eli Lilly (in the US), VIR-7831 from Vir Biotechnology/GlaxoSmithKline (in the US), and CT-PD9 from Celltrion (in South Korea and Europe)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 variants beta, gamma and delta escape from some of the currently available therapeutic mAbs. REGN10933 (i.e. one of the antibodies from the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail) showed reduced activity against SARS-CoV-2 beta and gamma, and activity of CT-P59 was reduced against beta, gamma and delta. LY-CoV555 completely lost its activity against beta, gamma and delta, with the cocktail of LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 still losing activity against beta, gamma, delta plus and mu<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. This demonstrates that several of the commercially available therapeutic mAbs lose their activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that there is a need for additional potent mAbs that recognize a broad range of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
<p id="P5">To further broaden application and accessibility, innovations remain highly sought after in the antibody space. Gene-based delivery is one such emerging approach. Administration of the mAb sequence, using e.g. plasmid DNA (pDNA) as vector, thereby enables <italic>in vivo</italic> production of the mAb of interest for a prolonged period of time<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Compared to conventional mAb therapy, this antibody gene transfer approach can bypass the costly and complex <italic>in vitro</italic> protein manufacturing, facilitate combinations, and allow for a reduced administration frequency. We previously demonstrated in mice and sheep that this technology can result in <italic>in vivo</italic> mAb expression for several months after intramuscular pDNA delivery, in which transfection efficiency is improved by use of electroporation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. A Phase I trial of a DNA-encoded mAb against Zika virus was initiated in 2019 (NTC: NCT03831503, sponsor: Inovio Pharmaceuticals), further illustrating the advances in clinical translation. In the context of COVID-19, various funding organizations, including the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), have dedicated considerable funding to the development of gene-based delivery of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs. Indeed, progress in mAb discovery and innovative delivery technologies can revolutionize emerging infectious diseases responses.</p>
<p id="P6">In this work, we sought to identify human mAbs reactive to all current SARS-CoV-2 variants both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and explore antibody gene transfer. We were able to generate highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAbs that are capable of treating SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, beta and delta infection in Syrian Golden hamsters. We demonstrated efficacy both as recombinant protein and encoded in pDNA, highlighting innovation in human mAb discovery and gene-based delivery.</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients</title>
<p id="P7">To identify fully human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we first analyzed RBD-binding titers and neutralizing antibody titers in serum, as well as the percentage RBD-positive B cells in PBMCs from 26 convalescent COVID-19 patients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Patient K-COV19-901, having both a high titer of neutralizing antibodies and a high number of RBD-specific B cells, was selected for the isolation of individual RBD-specific B cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), using biotinylated RBD (Wuhan isolate) combined with streptavidin-PE as bait (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Next, these single B cells were used as starting material for our single B cell cloning strategy, where we amplified the coding sequence of the IgG antibody heavy and light chain variable domains and combined them with the human IgG1 constant domain in a vector for recombinant mAb production. A panel of 20 unique mAb sequences (labelled K-COV-901-X, further mentioned as “X”) was selected for <italic>in vitro</italic> production and subsequent characterization. All 20 antibodies retained RBD and trimeric spike antigen (Wuhan) binding <italic>in vitro</italic> when analyzed via ELISA or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. In addition, antibodies showed picomolar affinities to the RBD antigen and trimeric spike antigen with equilibrium constants (K<sub>D</sub> values) ranging from 31 to 443 pM and 32 to 243 pM, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Next, we evaluated the functional activity of these antibodies <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we used a pseudovirus assay with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (D614G) on its surface and evaluated pseudovirus infection of Vero E6 cells in the presence and absence of each of the antibodies. Out of 20 mAbs, 16 could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, with 8 very potent mAbs having a half-maximal 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) lower than 1 nM and mAb 3B8 having an IC<sub>50</sub> of only 0.017 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Given their potent neutralizing capacity, these 8 mAbs were selected for further characterization.</p>

<title>Evaluation of <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronavirus species</title>
<p id="P9">With the continuous emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, it was crucial to evaluate antigen binding and neutralizing capacity of the selected antibodies against these variants as well. RBD antigens bearing the single mutations E484K, E484Q, N501Y and L452R, present – alone or combined – in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, delta and others), as well as RBD antigens bearing the double mutation E484Q, L452R or triple mutation K417N, E484K, N501Y, as present in SARS-CoV-2 variants kappa and beta respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, were used to assess binding and affinity of the 8 most potent antibodies via both ELISA and SPR. In addition, RBD mutations N439K, described as an antibody evasion mutant<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, and RBD Y453F, originating from Danish mink farms and a potential neutralization resistance mutation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, were evaluated (an overview of the analyzed RBD single mutations and their presence in SARS-CoV-2 variants is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, 7 out of 8 antibodies retained their binding capacity against all analyzed RBD single mutant antigens. One mAb, 2B11, showed reduced binding to RBD L452R and did not bind RBD E484K. This mAb did neither bind the antigens with multiple mutations that included L452R or E484K. mAb 1C11, although binding with all single mutant antigens, lost its activity against RBD L452R, E484Q double mutant antigen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> top part). All antibodies that bound the single mutant RBD antigens, still showed high affinities to these antigens, as evident from the equilibrium constants (K<sub>D</sub>) ranging from 9 – 647 pM. Only antibodies 1C11 and 2B11 showed an increased K<sub>D</sub> value for RBD L452R (2940 pM and 3146 pM respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> bottom part).</p>
<p id="P10">In addition to antigen binding, functional activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated in a cytopathic effect neutralization test (CPENT) using live SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, alpha, beta and gamma virus strains and Vero E6 cells, as well as in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using live SARS-CoV-2 delta strain with the same cell line. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and alpha was best neutralized by antibodies 3B8 and 2B2 (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 0.63 and ≤ 0.16 nM respectively), while SARS-CoV-2 beta infection was best neutralized by antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 0.32 nM). The same was true for SARS-CoV-2 gamma (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 0.37 nM for 3B8 and 3E6), although the high standard deviations hinder drawing strong conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 delta was most potently neutralized by 3B8 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.01 nM), with next in line antibodies 1C1, 2D6, 3E6 (IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.98 – 1.08 nM). On the other hand, antibodies 2B11 and 1C11 lost their neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 delta (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 67 nM). Overall, mAb 3B8 was the most potent neutralizing mAb towards all variants, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.37 nM to 0.01 nM for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 gamma and delta strain respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">The eight selected neutralizing antibodies were also tested for their ability to cross-neutralize other human coronavirus strains using VSV pseudotypes expressing the spike protein from SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory stress (MERS)-CoV or 229E-CoV on their surface. However, none of the selected antibodies was able to cross-neutralize one of these coronavirus species when used at a concentration of 16.67 nM (or 2.5 μg/ml) (data not shown).</p>

<title>Classification of mAb epitopes</title>
<p id="P12">The selected mAbs were classified in different categories based on their epitope specificity using an ELISA cross-competition assay where the antibodies were pairwise tested against one another. Two groups could be distinguished consisting of antibodies 1A10, 1C1 and 2D6 on the one hand and antibodies 2B2, 2B11 and 1C11 on the other hand. Antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 could not be classified in one of these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the 8 selected mAbs bind to 4 different regions of the RBD antigen.</p>

<title>Potent <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy on different SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Syrian golden hamster model</title>
<p id="P13">Antibodies 3B8, 3E6, 2B2 and 1C1 were selected for <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation based on their <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing activity combined with their variability in epitope binding. In a first study, 30 hamsters were divided into 5 groups (6 animals/group) and infected intranasally with 50 μl of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan virus suspension (containing approximately 2x10<sup>6</sup> tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>)). After 24h, antibodies 3B8, 3E6, 2B2, 1C1 or a human IgG1 isotype control were injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/kg. All animals were sacrificed at 4 days post infection for analysis of viral RNA and viral infectious titer in the lungs, as well as mAb concentration in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The presence of therapeutic RBD-specific human antibodies circulating in the blood of the treated hamsters was verified through ELISA. This revealed that 5 animals (1 out of 6 for clone 3E6 and 2 out of 6 for clones 2B2 and 1C1) were not successfully injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). We therefore excluded all animals without detectable serum levels from further analysis. In all groups, mAb treatment reduced viral RNA load in lung tissue as compared to the isotype control group with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05 for 2B2; p &lt; 0.01 for 3B8, 3E6, 1C1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). No infectious virus in the lung tissue could be detected in any of the animals treated with mAb 3B8. In animals treated with antibodies 3E6 and 2B2, a low infectious titer was detected in 1 animal, while three out of four animals treated with mAb 1C1 had a low detectable titer. In all groups, the difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) compared to the isotype control group, thus showing good <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan) infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">As it was shown previously that SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern beta and delta are more resistant to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies or currently available mAb treatments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, and given that SARS-CoV-2 delta is currently the most dominant variant worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, we decided to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment efficacy of our antibodies against both variants as well. A study design similar to the first study was used, with 30 hamsters divided in 5 groups and intranasally infected with 50 μl of SARS-CoV-2 beta<sup>

Animals were injected intraperitoneally with IgG1 isotype control or antibodies 3B8, 3E6, 2B2 and REGN-COV-2 at 5 mg/kg 24h post infection and were sacrificed 4 days post infection, with REGN-COV-2 antibody cocktail included for benchmarking purposes<sup>

</sup>. In the study using SARS-CoV-2 beta, one animal from groups 3B8, 2B2, 1C1 and REGN-CoV-2 as well as two animals from group 3E6 were excluded from analysis because of the absence of detectable antibody serum levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). In addition, it should be noted that two animals, one from group 3B8 and one from group 2B2, showed very low antibody serum titers, but were not excluded from analysis (indicated by open symbols in the respective groups). Viral RNA load in lung tissue was significantly reduced by treatment with mAb 3B8, 3E6 and REGN-CoV-2 compared to isotype control (p &lt; 0.05 for 3B8 and 3E6; p &lt; 0.01 for REGN-CoV-2), while the reduction observed for 2B2 was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). No infectious viral titer in lung tissue (TCID<sub>50</sub>) could be detected upon treatment with 3B8, 3E6 or REGN-CoV-2 (p &lt; 0.01 compared to isotype control), while a viral titer was still detectable in four out of five animals treated with 2B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). When analyzing the efficacy of our antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 delta infection, a similar picture was observed. Here, only one animal from group 2B2 was excluded because of a lack of detectable serum concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). All treatments resulted in a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.01) of both viral load and infectious viral titers in lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 e and f</xref>), with no detectable viral titers in animals treated with antibodies 3B8, 3E6 and REGN-CoV-2. In conclusion, treatment with antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 at 24h post infection resulted in a statistically significant reduction of virus in lung tissue of animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 beta or delta. Although significantly reducing infectious viral titers in lung tissue of animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 delta, mAb 2B2 seems to be less potent as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 beta and delta infection compared to antibodies 3B8 and 3E6, an observation corresponding to the <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization data for these variants.</p>

<title>Dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy of 3B8</title>
<p id="P15">Antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 both completely abrogated infectious viral titers after infection with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, beta and delta when administered 24h post infection at 5 mg/kg. As 3B8 was superior to 3E6 in <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization experiments, this mAb was used in an <italic>in vivo</italic> dose-response experiment. Hamsters were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 delta (1x10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>). At 24h post infection, isotype control (5 mg/kg) or mAb 3B8 (5 mg/kg; 1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg or 0.04 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. Animals were sacrificed at day 4 post infection. No animals were excluded from analysis based on a lack of detectable antibody serum levels, although one animal from group 0.2 mg/kg had serum levels 3 times lower compared to its group members (animal indicated by open symbol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). Treatment with a dose of 5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of 3B8 significantly reduced the amount of viral RNA detected in lung tissue, and resulted in undetectable levels of infectious virus. 5, 1 and 0.2 mg/kg showed significant differences in viral RNA (p &lt; 0.05 or &lt; 0.01 for 5 vs 1 mg/kg or 5 vs 0.2/0.04 mg/kg respectively; p &lt; 0.01 for 1 vs 0.2 or 0.04 mg/kg), indicating a positive dose-response effect. When dosing at 0.2 mg/kg, no statistically significant (p=0.13) decrease in viral RNA was seen, but infectious virus was undetectable in lung tissue of 3 out of 6 animals, and was decreased (more than 4 times lower than lower limit of 95% confidence interval from isotype control group) in a fourth animal. In the animal having reduced antibody titers (open symbol), no reduction in viral titer could be observed. Also, at the lowest dose of 0.04 mg/kg, no effect could be observed on viral RNA or infectious viral titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b and c</xref>).</p>

<title>Intramuscular delivery of DNA-based 3B8</title>
<p id="P16">To assess whether 3B8 could be produced <italic>in vivo</italic> at sufficient titers to protect from SARS-CoV-2 delta infection, intramuscular electroporation of DNA-encoded 3B8 (p3B8) was performed in hamsters either on day 10, day 7 or day 5 prior to infection. Median 3B8 serum levels at day 0, the day of intranasal infection, ranged between 30 μg/ml (p3B8 at day -5) and 90 μg/ml (p3B8 at day -10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). All transfected hamsters displayed detectable mAb titers. The longer the lag time between p3B8 delivery and infection, the higher the resulting serum 3B8 concentrations at day 0. This was anticipated, as <italic>in vivo</italic> expressed mAb levels typically increase and accumulate in the first two weeks after intramuscular pDNA administration<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Of note, mAb titers did not consistently or significantly increase between day 0 and day 4 post infection, and a markedly higher variability was observed at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). These observations are likely linked to the interaction of 3B8 with the virus (including target-mediated clearance) from day 0 on. Irrespective of the timing of pDNA administration, the <italic>in vivo</italic> produced 3B8 levels were sufficient to protect the animals from viral challenge. Compared to the untreated control group, all animals showed a significantly lower amount of viral RNA in lung tissue, and undetectable levels of infectious virus (except for one animal at day -7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>). No 3B8 dose-response effect was observed, since all timepoints gave a profound protection. These data show how intramuscular injection of DNA-based 3B8 provides a robust <italic>in vivo</italic> mAb expression and protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Despite vaccination rates steadily increasing, the majority of individuals worldwide have not been fully vaccinated and the number of SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. In addition, vaccine-breakthrough infections are becoming more prevalent. These may be explained by waning vaccine protection, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibody neutralization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. mAb treatments can therefore play a crucial role in addressing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and to prevent rapid dissemination of viral infection in specific settings, such as elderly care homes.</p>
<p id="P18">In this study, eight highly potent neutralizing mAbs (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 1 nM) were identified from a convalescent COVID-19 patient, by leveraging our B cell mining platform. Six out of eight antibodies bound all analyzed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens bearing single or multiple mutations. Affinities were evaluated for RBD antigens with single mutations and shown to be in the picomolar range. Corresponding to the antigen binding data, <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assays using live SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, alpha, beta, gamma and delta strains showed that these antibodies potently cross-neutralized all variants with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.01 to 3.97 nM. Interestingly, data from the cross-competition ELISA showed that these antibodies were not all targeting the same epitope, but could be divided into four epitope groups.</p>
<p id="P19">The most potent mAb of each of these epitope classes was tested for therapeutic activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in Syrian golden hamsters. This model has been widely used to assess the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection as it closely mimics the clinical disease observed in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Using this model, we designed three different therapeutic studies to evaluate the efficacy of our antibodies as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, beta and delta infection. We showed that antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 reduced median viral RNA titers with a factor 50 - 5000 or 10 - 330 respectively when used as a treatment (5 mg/kg) for all tested SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, treatment with these antibodies resulted in undetectable levels of infectious virus in the lungs of almost all animals. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that 3B8 and 3E6 target an epitope conserved between the different variants, abolishing the need for combination therapy for the current SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, since we identified potent neutralizing antibodies from different epitope groups, combination therapy remains an option in the future if additional variants of concern appear. Indeed, thanks to the advancements in mAb identification and characterization at display in this study, we can rapidly identify multiple mAbs of varying specificity and potency, which in combination could result in enhanced breadth and potency.</p>
<p id="P20">Importantly, we also showed that 3B8 is an ultrapotent therapeutic mAb, with treatment at a dose of 1 mg/kg resulting in undetectable infectious viral titers. Even when administered at 0.2 mg/kg, viral replication was reduced, with median infectious viral titers of the treatment group being 67 times lower compared to the isotype control group. This further highlights the potency of mAb 3B8 in a therapeutic setting<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. High potencies are crucial to decrease cost of goods, enable sustainable manufacturability and increase the number of doses produced annually, and may therefore also facilitate the availability of therapeutic mAbs to low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p id="P21">When comparing the mAbs identified in this study with the commercially available ones, we noticed that K<sub>D</sub> values observed for our antibodies were consistently between 3- and 200-fold lower than values reported for marketed antibodies of Vir Biotechnology, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals or Eli Lilly<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. However, when analyzing K<sub>D</sub> values of REGN-COV2 antibodies 10933 and 10987 in our own experiments for benchmarking purposes, K<sub>D</sub> values were similar to values observed for our mAbs (data not shown). In addition, it should be noted that antibodies 3B8 and 3E6 each performed equally well as monotherapy (when administered at 5 mg/kg) to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection beta and delta in hamsters when compared to the marketed REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, which consists of two different antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, we could observe therapeutic efficacy of mAb 3B8 <italic>in vivo</italic> at a dose of only 0.2 mg/kg. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, no <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic mAb efficacy data have been published yet for SARS-CoV-2 delta infection in hamsters. In addition, only for REGN-COV2 some therapeutic efficacy was reported in hamsters at such low mAb doses, although after infection of hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and using different readouts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P22">In addition to demonstrating our ability to select and characterize highly potent neutralizing human mAbs from a COVID-19 patient, we evaluated the DNA-based delivery of 3B8, an innovative delivery approach that could revolutionize the application of mAb therapeutics for infectious diseases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. We found that intramuscular electroporation of p3B8 provided a robust <italic>in vivo</italic> mAb expression and protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta infection, irrespective of the timepoint of p3B8 administration. The resulting mAb serum concentrations produced <italic>in vivo</italic> were similar to or significantly higher than what was observed after i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg 3B8 protein. As a consequence, lower pDNA doses and/or alternative timepoints (closer to or after viral infection), are anticipated to still demonstrate efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA-based delivery of a SARS-Cov-2-neutralizing mAb can protect from viral infection. Such approach can complement and accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of (combinations of) mAbs, and allow us to keep up the pace with the current and future pandemics.</p>
<p id="P23">Although no clear evidence for antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19 patients has been reported until now, it has been suggested that its potential risk should be continuously monitored<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. In this light, it should be emphasized that the high potency of 3B8 is obtained without the contribution of Fc-mediated effector functions, as fully human IgG1 antibodies were not species-matched before administration to hamsters. This suggests that mAb 3B8 will tolerate the future introduction of Fc-effector silence mutations to avoid any potential risk of ADE, favoring its further evaluation as a future mAb treatment.</p>
<p id="P24">In conclusion, the high therapeutic potency of mAb 3B8 <italic>in vivo</italic> against SARS-CoV-2 delta, achieved both as protein and encoded in plasmid, combined with its broad cross-reactivity against all other tested SARS-CoV-2 variants, make 3B8 a very interesting candidate to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of accelerated human mAb discovery and innovative gene-based delivery, at display in the current study, holds the potential to revolutionize emerging infectious diseases responses.</p>

Monoclonal Abs were then captured between 30 and 100 RU. Increasing concentrations of analyte were sequentially injected in one single cycle at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The dissociation was monitored for 30 min. The chip was finally regenerated with 3M MgCl2 before a new mAb was captured. A reference flow was used as a control for non-specific binding and refractive index changes. Several buffer blanks were used for double referencing. Binding affinities (KD) were derived after fitting the experimental data to the 1:1 binding model in the Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1 using the single cycle kinetic procedure. Each interaction was repeated a least three times.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, HEK-293T cells (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-S) or BHK-21J cells (229E) were transfected with the respective S protein expression plasmids, and one day later infected (MOI = 2) with GFP-encoding VSVΔG backbone virus (purchased from Kerafast). Two hours later, the medium was replaced by medium containing anti-VSV-G antibody (I1-hybridoma, ATCC CRL-2700) to neutralize residual VSV-G input. After 24 h incubation at 32°C, the supernatants were harvested. To quantify nAbs, serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C with an equal volume of S pseudotyped VSV particles and inoculated on Vero E6 cells (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) or Huh-7 cells (229E and MERS-S) for 18 hours. The percentage of GFP expressing cells was quantified on a Cell Insight CX5/7 High Content Screening platform (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with Thermo Fisher Scientific HCS Studio (v.6.6.0) software. Neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined by normalizing the serum neutralization dilution curve to a virus (100%) and cell control (0%) and fitting in Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).</p>

<p id="P36">The titers of the virus stocks (TCID<sub>50</sub>) and 50% neutralizing titers (log<sub>10</sub>CPENT<sub>50</sub>) were determined using cytopathic effect (CPE)-based cell assays and CPE-based virus neutralization tests (CPENT), respectively, on VeroE6 cells with some modifications. Shortly, 10<sup>4</sup> VeroE6 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates one day prior to the titration and inoculated with 10–fold serial dilutions of virus solutions and cultured for 3 days at 37°C. Later, assays first visually scored for CPE and then stained with MTS/Phenazine methosulphate (PMS; Sigma- Aldrich) solution for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the dark. Post MTS/PMS staining absorbance was measured at 498 nm for each well. All assays were performed in six replicates and TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml was determined using Reed and Muench method<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. CPENT was measured in a similar way as the CPE assays for viral titration with some modifications. In brief, serial dilutions of antibodies were mixed separately with live SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, alpha, beta and gamma virus strains, incubated at 37 °C for 1h, and added to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells. All distinct antibodies were assayed in triplicate in serial dilutions. CPE neutralization was calculated with the following formula: % neutralization activity = % CPE reduction = (OD <sub>Virus + antibody</sub> – OD <sub>VC</sub>) / (OD <sub>CC</sub> – OD <sub>VC</sub>) *100 and 50% neutralization titers (CPENT<sub>50</sub>) were calculated with non-linear regression. Cells either unexposed to the virus or mixed with TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2 were used as negative (uninfected) and positive (infected) controls, respectively.</p>

<p id="P38">Dose-dependent neutralization of distinct antibodies was assessed by mixing the antibodies at different concentrations, with 100 PFU SARS-CoV-2 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and incubating the mixture at 37°C for 1h. Antibody-virus complexes were then added to VeroE6 cell monolayers in 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 1h. Subsequently, the inoculum mixture was replaced with 0.8% (w/v) methylcellulose in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After 3 days incubation at 37°C, the overlays were removed, the cells were fixed with 3.7% PFA, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Half-maximum neutralization titers (PRNT50) were defined as the antibody concentration that resulted in a plaque reduction of 50%.</p>

Female Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) were purchased from Janvier Laboratories and kept per two in individually ventilated isolator cages (IsoCage N Bio-containment System, Tecniplast) at 21°C, 55% humidity and 12:12 day/night cycles. Housing conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the ethics committee of animal experimentation of KU Leuven (license P065-2020). For infection, female hamsters of 6-8 weeks old and 75-100 g were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine/atropine and inoculated intranasally with 50 μL containing either 2×10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2 (ancestral Wuhan strain), 1×10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (Beta B.1.351), or 1×10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (Delta B.1.617.2). Antibody protein treatments (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs or human IgG1 isotype control Trastuzumab/Herceptin® (Roche)) were initiated 24 hours post infection by intraperitoneal injection. Intramuscular pDNA electroporation was done at d-10, d-7 and d-5 infection. Hamsters were monitored for appearance, behavior, and weight. At day 4 post-infection, animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 500 μL Dolethal (200 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital, Vétoquinol SA). Lungs were collected and viral RNA and infectious virus were quantified by RT-qPCR and end-point virus titration, respectively. Blood samples were collected at end-point for pharmacokinetic analysis. No randomization methods were used and confounders were not controlled, though all caretakers and technicians were blinded to group allocation in the animal facility and to sample numbers for analysis (qPCR, titration, and histology).</p>

Hamsters received an intramuscular p3B8 injection in their left and right tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle (pretreated with hyaluronidase), followed by electroporation. The procedure was performed by adapting a previously optimized and validated pre-clinical protocol for mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. In brief, fur at the target sites was removed using depilatory product (Veet, Reckitt Benckiser), at least two days prior to pDNA injection. Intramuscular delivery sites were injected with 100 μl of 0.4 U/μl hyaluronidase from bovine testes reconstituted in sterile saline (H4272, Sigma-Aldrich), approximately one hour prior to pDNA electrotransfer. Total p3B8 amount delivered per hamster was 600 μg (75 μl pDNA, at 2 μg/μl per muscle, formulated in sterile MQ H2O). Intramuscular injections of pDNA were immediately followed by <italic>in situ</italic> electroporation using the NEPA21 Electroporator (Sonidel) with CUY650P5 tweezer electrodes at a fixed width of 7 mm. Signa Electrode Gel (Parker Laboratories) was applied to the muscle to target an impedance below 0.6 Ohm. Three series of four 20 ms square-wave pulses of 120 V with a 50 ms interval were applied with polarity switching after two of the four pulses. During the procedures, hamsters were sedated using isoflurane inhalation. Electroporation parameters were based on pilot studies in hamster with a firefly luciferase reporter pDNA (data not shown). Pulse delivery was verified using the NEPA21 readout.</p>
