<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The global community continues to face substantial morbidity and mortality due to ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> To date, more than 200 million people have sustained infection and over 4 million have succumbed to the disease worldwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> The unprecedented effort to develop and bring to the world effective vaccines has proven remarkably successful, yet there remains an unmet need for additional therapeutic options. Notably, antibody treatment from convalescent patient-derived plasma or with recombinant monoclonal antibodies delivered intravenously have demonstrated efficacy in acute infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> While these treatments have potent neutralizing capacity, they come with the limitation of moderate to high cost and intravenous infusion requirement, which may limit their utility in global distribution. This presents an opportunity to explore lower-cost adjunct therapeutics that can be delivered easily. For example, delivery of inhaled treatments to the respiratory system may result in lower dose requirements and direct engagement of the virus at the site of early infection.</p>
<p id="P3">The <italic>Camelidae</italic> family, which includes dromedaries, camels, IIamas, and alpacas, possess a subclass of immunoglobulins which consist of paired heavy chains with antigen-binding variable domains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> These single-domain monovalent antigen binding domains, also known as nanobodies, are ~12 to 15 kDa in size yet still exhibit potent affinity to target antigens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> Moreover, nanobodies can readily be expressed in different expression systems, including bacteria, yeast and many mammalian cell lines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> Due to their exceptional stability in a wide range of pH and temperature and their ability to be lyophilized and aerosolized, nanobody therapies have been developed for nebulization delivery in treating respiratory diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> Nanobodies with potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified by several approaches, such as the immunization of llamas, alpacas and camelid mice with SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD, screening phage or yeast display libraries of naive llama nanobody or humanized synthetic nanobody libraries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>We previously reported on the isolation and biophysical characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding nanobody, NIH-CoVnb-112, which possesses robust biophysical properties and binds to RBD with a low nanomolar affinity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Thus, nanobodies are an attractive platform for the future development of novel therapeutic, diagnostic, and detection applications.</p>
<p id="P4">Here, in order to describe the molecular basis of the neutralization potency and breadth of CoVnb-112, we determined the high-resolution structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. Our studies reveal that the epitope of NIH-CoVnb-112 largely overlaps the receptor-binding motif that engages the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as the primary receptor for viral attachment and entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup> confirming the RBD-specificity of CoVnb-112. Furthermore, structural analyses indicate that recurrent RBD escape mutations are well accommodated within the nanobody-RBD interface with minor disruption of nanobody-RBD contact residues. This modeling data corroborates NIH-CoVnb-112 binding and pseudovirus neutralization assays demonstrate a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variant data to RBD mutants and <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization data against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus from four variants of concern, including the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2). Finally, we demonstrate a robust reduction of viral burden and prevention of lung pathology in a hamster model of COVID-19 following nebulized delivery of NIH-CoVnb-112. These results support the case for further development of nanobody-based therapeutics for COVID-19.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P5">A key advantage of nanobodies is the ability to easily transition to alternative expression systems for scaled material production. Previously, we cloned the NIH-CoVnb-112 coding sequence into the pICZα <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> expression vector.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Using the same clone, fermentation was performed under defined parameters in a 4-liter DCI Tryton bioreactor. Following 72 hours of monitored feed methanol growth, the supernatant was harvested, concentrated by tangential flow filtration, and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The final yield for the 4-liter expression was 1.1 grams as measured by absorbance, with a purity of &gt;95%. This preparation was used for all experiments reported here.</p>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Structural basis of NIH-CoVnb-112 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD</title>
<p id="P6">To elucidate the broad-spectrum reactivity of NIH-CoVnb-112 against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and to map its epitope, we determined its crystal structure bound to the prototype SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 2.82 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). NIH-CoVnb-112 binds to the RBD through a canonical site of vulnerability that significantly overlaps the ACE2 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a–b</xref>). Over 70% of the contact surface is mediated through residues within the elongated tyrosine-rich Complementarity-Determining Region 3 (CDR3) that forms an extensive shape-complementarity interaction with the receptor binding motif (RBM, residues 403-505) of the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c–e</xref>). The CDR3 loop traverses the amphiphilic groove flanked by the protruding RBD tip (residues 470-492) and the RBD-core, which is stabilized by an atypical inter-CDR disulfide (C<sup>50</sup>
<sub>CDR2</sub>–C<sup>100H</sup>
<sub>CDR3</sub>, as defined using Kabat numbering<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>). This disulfide is conserved in two published nanobody homologs, WNb-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup> and VHH-E, isolated from alpaca<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, both of which also bind the RBD in a similar manner, highlighting the functional importance of this CDR-stabilizing disulfide. The 21 amino acid length CDR3 contains six conserved tyrosines; of these, three pairs of Π-Π interactions appear to be crucial for the CDR3 loop conformation, including the face-to-face stacking of F<sup>490</sup>RBD and Y<sup>100E</sup>nb112 and the two face-to-edge contacts between Y<sup>449</sup>RBD-Y<sup>99</sup>nb112 and Y<sup>505</sup>RBD-Y<sup>102</sup>nb112, as documented by their high buried surface area (BSA) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Outside of the CDR3’s extensive contact region, the extended CDR2 hairpin also helps stabilize the RBD tip (residues 481-487) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c–d</xref>). Of note, the side chain of F<sup>486</sup>RBD stacks against the backbone of the CDR2 hairpin and fills the cavity formed by the inter-connected CDR2 and CDR3 loops. As a result, F<sup>486</sup>RBD has the highest BSA value among all the RBD epitope residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). There are six additional hydrogen bonds formed between the RBD and nanobody residues outside of CDR3, including nanobody framework residue T<sup>28</sup> to Q<sup>498</sup>RBD, CDR1 residues D<sup>30</sup> and Y<sup>31</sup> to G<sup>445</sup>RBD and Y<sup>449</sup>RBD, and the side chains of CDR2 residues Y<sup>58</sup> and D<sup>61</sup> to Y<sup>489</sup>RBD and N<sup>487</sup>RBD. Collectively, the CDR3-mediated nanobody-RBD recognition underlies the structural basis for NIH-CoVnb-112 neutralization, which overlaps the ACE2 binding site on the RBD.</p>
<p id="P8">The structure also provides information regarding NIH-CoVnb-112’s cross-reactivity against circulating SARS-CoV-2 escape variants. Based on the contribution of F<sup>490</sup> to the interface we predict that the Lambda mutation F490S will disrupt Π-Π stacking with CDR3 Y<sup>100E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) which might lead to a minor impairment of NIH-CoVnb-112 recognition to this variant. On the other hand, the hydrogen-bond network between NIH-CoVnb-112 CDR3 residues and the RBD (residues 487-505) which ACE2 also uses in binding to the RBD bypasses the frequently mutated E<sup>484</sup>RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The E484K or E484Q mutation present in the Beta, Gamma, Zeta, Theta, Iota and Kappa SARS-CoV-2 variants, can be accommodated by NIH-CoVnb-112 with no steric hindrance or charge-repulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) which is supported by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) binding data showing that RBDE484K binds to NIH-CoVnb-112 with a comparable affinity to that of wildtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Another frequently mutated RBD residue, N<sup>501</sup>rbd, interacts with CDR3 Y<sup>102</sup> with a hydrogen-bond distance of ~2.9 Å. This can potentially be disrupted by the N501Y mutation present in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Theta SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>), but BLI binding data shows only a 2-fold reduction in the KD of RBDN501Y as compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Notably, the K<sup>417</sup>RBD mutation site also present in some of these variants is not involved in a hydrogen bond or salt bridge with NIH-CoVnb-112, suggesting that the K-to-N or K-to-T mutations here would have little impact on its binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, two Delta RBD mutations, L452R and T478K, may have opposite effects on NIH-CoVnb-112 binding: the extended guanidinium side chain of L452R likely clashes with CDR3 backbone while negatively charged T478K could reach out to the positively charged CDR2 D<sup>61</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">The NIH-CoVnb-112 epitope largely overlaps with the binding sites of a number of other neutralizing antibodies (e.g., C105, CC12.1, CC12.3)<sup>20</sup> and nanobodies (e.g., MR-17,<sup>21</sup> WNb-2,<sup>13</sup> and VHH-E<sup>10</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Interestingly, two neutralizing nanobodies, alpaca-derived VHH-U<sup>10</sup> and nanomouse-produced nb-12<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, bind to the RBD core outside of the RBM and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a lower potency as compared with the best-in-class ACE2-blocking nanobodies suggesting that the RBM interaction is important for neutralization potency. Koenig et al. report that nanobody cocktails targeting distinct vulnerable epitopes on the RBD markedly suppress mutational escape<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Structural superposition of NIH-CoVnb-112 with the closed and open SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer reveals that it can only bind to the RBD in “up” conformation, even though its epitope remains mostly solvent accessible in the closed spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which places it into the class 1 of RBD-specific antibodies/nanobodies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> A cocktail of NIH-CoVnb-112 with nanobodies from other RBD binding classes might therefore suppress mutational escape. In total, there are 34 NIH-CoVnb-112 and 36 RBD residues involved in the binding interface with a buried surface area of ~1045 Å<sup>2</sup> for the complex, which is larger than those for other RBD specific nanobodies, yet similar in area to WNb-2, whose structures have been determined and significantly larger than that of the human receptor ACE2 for the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">e</xref>).</p>

<title>In vitro affinity measurements of NIH-CoVnb-112 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants</title>
<p id="P10">To evaluate the potency of NIH-CoVnb-112 against the current variants of concern, we performed biolayer interferometry using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. NIH-CoVnb-112 was biotinylated using standard NHS-labeling chemistry to allow for capture on streptavidin-coated biosensors. Serial dilutions of each SARS-CoV-2 RBD, ranging from 300 – 18.75nM, were prepared in a sample buffer containing 0.1% BSA to block non-specific background binding. The background corrected curves were then fitted using a 1:1 interaction model to derive the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), which results in a KD measurement of 1.59nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The affinities of several SARS-CoV-2 variant RBDs were then measured in the same manner with NIH-CoVnb-112 attached to sensor and variant RBDs in solution over the same concentration range. Curve fitting produced KD values for Alpha: 3.0nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), Beta: 4.28nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), Gamma: 4.16nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and Delta: 1.66nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The individual association constants (kon) reveal similar values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) of 1.53X10<sup>5</sup> to 2.23x10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> for the prototype, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma RBDs, with the notable exception of the Delta variant RBD which had a 2-fold increase in the binding rate at 4.61x10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Conversely, all four variant RBDs had dissociation constants (koff) which were faster at 4.28x10<sup>-4</sup> to 8.22x10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, a 2 to 4-fold increase versus 2.36x10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for the prototype RBD. Thus, NIH-CoVnb-112 had similar <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to several relevant SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants.</p>

<title>NIH-CoVnb-112 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assessment of variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus</title>
<p id="P11">To gain insight into the potential neutralization potency of NIH-CoVnb-112 against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we performed pseudotyped neutralization assays for several noted variants. Using the reported mutations and deletions for the variant spike proteins, modifications were introduced to the prototype sequence as follows: (Alpha - B.1.1.7 - Δ69-70, Δ144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H), (Beta - B.1.351 - D80A, Δ242-245, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V), (Gamma - P.1 - L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I and V1176F), and (Delta - B.1.617.2 - T19R, K77R, G142D, 156del, 157del, R158G, A222V, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R and D950N). Pseudotyped lentivirus possessing an RFP reporter was produced by transient transfection of HEK293T/17 cells and the virons were harvested and purified over a sucrose cushion. For each variant, a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 was used to transduce monolayers of HEK293T-ACE2 cells in the presence of NIH-CoVnb-112 at concentrations ranging from 714pM to 714nM. Media was replaced at 24 hours and the cells harvested at 48 hours post infection for flow cytometry. The percentage of transduction, as measured by the gated positive RFP population, for each concentration was normalized using a virus only transduction at the time of each assay to calculate percent inhibition. Dose-response curve fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) allows for calculating the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) for each variant pseudovirus. The EC<sub>50</sub> for the SARS-CoV-2 prototype sequence (14.3nM) is within agreement of the previously reported concentration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> The SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences similarly yielded EC<sub>50</sub> values: Alpha (9.4nM), Beta (15.8nM), Gamma (17.6nM) and Delta (14.5nM). Notably, there are differences in the apparent slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) of the neutralization curves, which have been correlated with the cooperativity of binding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> Thus, NIH-CoVnb-112 had similar potency in pseudotyped neutralization assays for several relevant SARS-CoV-2 spike variants.</p>

<title>Nebulization treatment of NIH-CoVnb-112 in a hamster model of COVID-19</title>
<p id="P12">To assess the potential prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of nebulized nanobody administration, we chose to evaluate nanobody prophylaxis (-24 hour pre-infection) and multiple post-exposure (+12 hour., 1dpi, 2dpi) treatments as outlined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Hamsters were randomized into saline only (n=8) or NIH-CoVnb-112 (n=8) only. Twenty-four hours prior to virus challenge, groups of 4 animals were placed in a containment box with an attached nebulizer. Animals received nebulized exposure of a 5mL solution containing normal saline alone or normal saline with 25mg/mL NIH-CoVnb-112 for 20 minutes. Twenty-four hours after the initial dose, all animals were challenged with ~10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> pfu of prototype SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal administration. Additional nebulization doses were given at 12 hours post virus infection, at 1 day post infection and for half of each group an additional dose at 2 days post infection as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This design was selected based on an initial pilot study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">7</xref>). Animals were observed for weight on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and oropharynx swabs taken on days 1, 2, and 3 post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Half of each group was euthanized on day 3 post infection and the remaining half euthanized on day 7 post infection for assessments of viral titer and histopathology assessments. Baseline weights of the nanobody group (169.3, 171.6, 192.6, and 164.9 grams) and the saline group (185.0, 199.7, 171.2, and 186.2 grams) were recorded prior to nebulization and compared to day 7, nanobody group (169.6, 168.5, 196.7, and 164.8 grams) and the saline group (168.2, 179.2, 162.2, and 175.3 grams), reveal an initial reduction for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) followed by resolution to near baseline in the NIH-CoVnb-112 treated group. In both groups, nasal turbinates at 3 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) had a sustained level of viral burden, with no apparent difference between treatment groups. By contrast, the level of viral burden in the cranial lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>) had a striking decrease of 6 order of magnitude, with three of the four samples below the limit of detection of the plaque assay (LLOQ = 10 pfu/100mg). In the oropharyngeal swabs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), both groups follow a decrease in viral titer over time with no apparent difference between groups. To assess the delivery dose to the lower respiratory tract following nebulization, hamsters euthanized on day 3 post infection had bronchoalveolar lavage performed and ELISA used to measure NIH-CoVnb-112 concentration. The level of NIH-CoVnb-112 on day 3 post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) had a mean concentration of 154 ng/mL, while the saline group, as expected, yielded only background values below the lower limit of quantification. Lung and tracheal tissue were collected at days 3 and 7 post infection to assess the impact of nebulization delivery of NIH-CoVnb-112 on pathology as described above using the semi-quantitative lung scoring scale on H&amp;E sections in a blinded manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e–f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Histological observation of the saline treatment group revealed pathological evidence of severe pulmonary disease, including perivascular and peribronchial mononuclear cell infiltration, focal tracheal necrosis and exfoliation, and moderate to severe septal and intra-alveolar infiltration of mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, marked interstitial inflammation and pneumocyte hyperplasia were prominent in the saline treatment group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In the NIH-CoVnb-112 treatment group, at both days 3 and 7 post infection the histology was within normal limits, with minimal tracheal and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and accumulation on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The total lung score and subset scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) reveal a pronounced distinction in lung score for the NIH-CoVnb-112 group (day 3 mean score = 2) versus the saline group (day 3 mean score = 26.75). By day 7 there was a modest increase in the NIH-CoVnb-112 group (day 7 mean score = 7), while the saline group increased markedly (day 7 mean score = 39.75). The increase in NIH-CoVnb-112 treatment lung score was a result of minor increases in vascular, alveolar, and interstitial inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">In summary, we provide the structural basis for effective neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and current variants of concern using the previously isolated nanobody, NIH-CoVnb-112.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> We determined the crystal structure of NIH-CoVnb-112 complexed with its primary viral target, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, to 2.8 Å resolution. We further explored the neutralization potential by performing pseudovirus neutralization assays with lentivirus expressing spike proteins with the entire constellation of mutations reported for each variant. We observed robust neutralization of each variant in a cell culture transduction assay, with EC<sub>50</sub> values comparable to the prototype SARS-CoV-2 spike lentivirus ranging from 9.4 – 17.6 nM. We then performed initial studies to determine the ability of the monomeric version of NIH-CoVnb-112 to provide protection when delivered by nebulization prior to and following viral challenge in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed six orders of magnitude reduction in the viral lung burden, absence of gross weight loss, and a significant reduction of lung pathology, demonstrating a robust protective benefit of nebulized nanobody therapy.</p>
<p id="P14">Given their small size and robust thermostability, nanobodies can be aerosolized for the direct treatment of respiratory diseases, as in the case of delivery of a trimeric nanobody for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>

</p>
<p id="P15">These studies did not demonstrate therapeutic delivery via nebulization. In contrast, Nambulli <italic>et al.</italic> delivered a trimeric nanobody, termed Pin-21, by nebulization in a hamster model of COVID-19 and observed a robust reduction in both lung pathology and viral burden with the maintenance of body weight during the study. These studies and our work provide support for the further investigation of nanobody-based pulmonary therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P16">We envision the use of nebulized nanobody-based treatments to provide prophylactic protection in healthcare settings, such as long-term care facilities, potentially reducing viral transmission in these community settings. In addition, the use of nebulized nanobody therapeutics could hypothetically provide effective early phase treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections, delivered in the home setting, potentially reducing the severity of disease. Translation to clinical trials will require improved delivery in animal models, including assessment in non-human primates, which represent a closer approximation to human lung anatomy. In addition, it is imperative to explore potential toxicity and immunogenicity effects due to nebulized delivery to ensure a satisfactory safety profile prior to human clinical trials.</p>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p id="P17">While the current results provide strength for using nanobodies as potential inhaled therapeutics, there are several limitations to this current study. First, the use of bio-layer interferometry and pseudovirus assays to measure <italic>in vitro</italic> binding and neutralization provide evidence that NIH-CoVnb-112 has broad potency, yet these assays must be interpreted with caution. In the setting of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and particularly the highly transmissible Delta variant, it is vital to assess the actual virus to ensure parity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings. The constellation of mutations in variants outside of the RBD may provide competitive fitness, which outstrips the ability of NIH-CoVnb-112 to effectively neutralize infection. Second, while acute weight loss and lung pathology provide metrics for assessing the early phase of infection, the natural course of disease in the Syrian hamster resolves with rare mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> Thus, the hamster model should be considered just one of several relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Third, the hamster experiments should be extended for future studies; the experiments presented here serve primarily as proof-of-concept for prophylactic and therapeutic potential. Given resource limitations, our studies had limitations on sample size and thus we have reported our findings without statistical analysis. We observed a robust viral load reduction and clear impact on lung pathology, which is encouraging but should not be considered definitive. Fourth, a purely therapeutic, multidose group with nebulization starting after symptomatic infection was not performed in this study and should be considered for future experiments to assess post-infection therapeutic efficacy. Fifth, dose-response studies would help inform the effective dose range of the delivered nanobody. Sixth, we did not assess NIH-CoVnb-112 clearance from the lung into the blood or the potential immunogenicity response from multiple dosing. Seventh, nebulizing NIH-CoVnb-112 in a passive containment system likely is inefficient for delivery to the upper and lower respiratory airways. Indeed, much of the nebulized nanobody was observed to condense onto the walls of the containment box and the fur of the hamsters. Use of a directed inhalation device would decrease the amount of nanobody used and provide a standard dose delivered. Eighth, the monomeric nature of NIH-CoVnb-112 may lead to reduced residence time in the lung, therefore methods for increasing the half-life should be explored to reduce the concentration required and number of doses for therapeutic effect. Exploring a multivalent nanobody cocktail<sup>

</sup> may be employed to significantly improve on the existing affinity.</p>
<p id="P18">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that NIH-CoVnb-112 possesses broad binding and neutralization capacity in the context of the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. These results provide support for continued development of NIH-CoVnb-112 as a nebulized delivery adjunct therapeutic for reducing early phase viral burden and prophylaxis against lung pathology.</p>

<p id="P32">Tissues from hamsters were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 7–14 days, embedded in paraffin, and cut sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Slides were read by a single veterinary pathologist blinded to the identity of the group including both day post infection and treatment status. Cranial lung histopathology was scored as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup> for the following metrics: overall lesion extent, bronchitis, alveolitis, pneumocyte hyperplasia, vasculitis, and interstitial inflammation; each on a 0–4 or 0–5 scale, and scores summed for each animal. Repeated intra-rater reliability scoring assessments deviated less than 5% of reported values.</p>

<title>Affinity binding curves of NIH-CoVnb-112 against SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants.</title>
<p>Using Biolayer Interferometry on a BioForte Octet Red96 system, association and dissociation rates were determined by immobilizing biotinylated-NIH-CoVnb-112 onto streptavidin-coated optical sensors (<bold>a-e</bold>). The nanobody-bound sensors were incubated with a concentration range (18.75 – 300nM) of recombinant RBDs, (<bold>a</bold>) Prototype, (<bold>b</bold>) Alpha (B.1.1.7), (<bold>c</bold>) Beta (B.1.351), (<bold>d</bold>) Gamma (P.1), and (<bold>e</bold>) Delta (B.1.617.2), for an initial time interval to allow association. The sensors were then moved to an RBD-free solution and allowed to dissociate over a second time interval. Curve fitting using a 1:1 interaction model allows for the affinity constant (KD) to be measured for each RBD variant as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p>

Adult Syrian hamsters (n=8/group, males, 12 weeks old) were treated at -24 hours prior to virus challenge with nebulized saline or NIH-CoVnb-112 (25mg/mL) in a 5mL volume over 20 minutes. Following intranasal challenge, each group was treated at 12 hours post infection with the same condition, and again at 1 dpi. Half of the animals in each group received a fourth dose at 2 dpi. Animals were weighed daily and oral swabs taken at dpi 1-3. Groups were euthanized at day 3 and day 7 post infection respectively and sample taken for assessment.
