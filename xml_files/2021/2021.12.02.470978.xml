Despite extensive research, the specific factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection that mediates the life-threatening inflammatory cytokine response in patients with severe COVID-19 remains unidentified. Herein we demonstrate that the virus-encoded Open Reading Frame 8 (ORF8) protein is abundantly secreted as a glycoprotein <italic>in vitro</italic> and in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. ORF8 specifically binds to the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to induce a non-canonical inflammasomal response, and a canonical response when the second activation signal is present. Levels of ORF8 protein in the blood correlate with severity and disease-specific mortality in patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the ORF8-induced inflammasome response was readily inhibited by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on three PBMC samples treated with ORF8-CM or control-CM. Single-cell transcriptome-based cell clustering showed that cells in cluster 5 (C5) on the t-SNE plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) were induced to express cytokines including IL1β, IL8, and CCL2 and inflammasome pathway components upon ORF8 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>).

Similar results were observed for IL8 and CCL2 expression as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

After extensive washes with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound ORF8 protein, the cells were then incubated at 37°C to initiate ORF8-mediated cell activation in the presence or absence of additional ORF8. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> shows robust IL1β mRNA expression was observed only in cells exposed to additional ORF8 but not those only pre-incubated with ORF8, suggesting that ORF8 likely enters monocytes through a non-receptor-mediated process, such as phagocytosis. Complementarily, we asked if ORF8 would bind to TLR2, TLR4, CD14, or NLRP3 known to be involved in inflammasome activation. We incubated ORF8 protein-coated beads with monocyte lysates from two ORF8 responding and two ORF8 nonresponding healthy donors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> shows that neither TLR2, TLR4, nor CD14 were co-precipitated with ORF8 (CD14 data not shown). However, NLRP3 was readily detected in one of the ORF8-responders, suggesting that indeed ORF8 binds to NLRP3 in primary human monocytes.</p><p id="P19">To further dissect how NLRP3 binds to ORF8, we transiently transfected ORF8-expressing HEK293 cells with Flag-tagged NLRP3 constructs Flag-N3-FL (full-length NLRP3), or one of the three deletion mutants Flag-N3-N, Flag-N3-M, or Flag-N3-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> Cell lysates were then incubated with Strep-Tactin™ beads to pulldown Strep-tagged ORF8 and its binding proteins. In addition to NLRP3-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), both Flag-N3-M, and Flag-N3-C but not Flag-N3-N also strongly co-precipitated with ORF8 suggesting both the middle NACHT domain and C-terminal LRR domain of NLRP3 each can independently bind to ORF8. These results clearly demonstrate inflammasome protein NLRP3 directly interacts with ORF8.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>ORF8 activates the NLRP3-mediated inflammasome pathways</title><p id="P20">The effect of LPS in inflammasomal activation has been well established; therefore, it was important to demonstrate that our purified ORF8 protein was free of LPS contamination. ORF8 and LPS were compared for their effects on IL1β, IL8, and CCL2 induction in three monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, and non-classical) from 15 healthy donors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref> shows that all three subsets responded to LPS while only CD14<sup>+</sup> (classical and intermediate) responded to ORF8 with variable induction of IL1β, IL8, and CCL2. These results show that ORF8 and LPS target monocytes with different cell type specificities. We then examined the responsiveness of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to LPS or ORF8 treatment using IL1β, IL8, and CCL2 expression as the readout, and we found that intracellular IL1β was detected in the majority (90.1%) of LPS-treated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes but only in a subpopulation (mean=38%) of ORF8 treated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. In contrast, CCL2 expression was detected only in a minor population (mean=22.1%) of LPS-treated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes but in a larger population of ORF8-treated CD14+ monocytes (mean=63.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that ORF8 and LPS also have different cytokine induction specificities. In addition, we also examined the cell proliferation and the IgM induction of mouse splenic B cells upon ORF8 and LPS treatment, and we found that the mouse splenic B cells did not proliferate, nor produced any polyclonal IgM 96 hours after ORF8 treatment, while LPS treated cells showed robust proliferation morphology and massive production of IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In the aggregate, our data clearly demonstrated that the cytokine inducing activity of ORF8 is not due to LPS contamination.</p><p id="P21">To examine the activation status of the canonical NFkB pathway necessary for the induction of inflammasomal proteins including NLPR3, Casp-1, and IL1β in ORF8 treated monocytes, we examined the GSEA analysis results and found that NFkB pathway components were transcriptionally enriched (NES=1.539662, FDR q-value=0) in ORF8 treated monocytes in cluster 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, left panel). To validate these at the protein level, we treated THP-1 cells with ORF8 for 4 and 24 hours and determined their NFkB pathway protein expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> (right panels) shows that the increased level of phospho-p65 and the conversion of p100 to p52 were readily detected 4 hours after ORF8 treatment. Similar results were also observed in LPS-treated cells. These data demonstrate that ORF8 stimulation activates the NFκB pathway triggering the activation of the inflammasome pathway in human monocytes.</p><p id="P22">Similarly, the GSEA analysis data revealed the mRNAs of inflammasome pathway components were also significantly enriched (NES=1.812154, FDR q-value =0.015483) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, left panel). We then treated THP-1 cells with ORF8 or LPS alone or in combination with nigericin, a potent agent that provides a second signal for the canonical inflammasomal pathway activation, for 4 or 24 hours. The cell lysates and culture supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of NLPR3, Caspase-1, Caspase-5, IL1β, and the pore-forming fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD) proteins. We found that ORF8 induces the inflammasome pathway by 1) activating the production of IL1β without requiring a separate priming step; 2) signaling through the non-canonical pathway using Casp-1 (early hours) followed by switching to Casp-4/5; 3) maintaining cell viability without triggering pyroptosis unless the second signal such as nigericin is present which rapidly initiates pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, right panel). Our data suggest that ORF8 and LPS may represent a family of pyrogens by triggering a non-canonical inflammasomal pathway leading to the production and release of IL1β without activating GSDMD to the level necessary for pyroptosis, a process called hyperactivation for LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> However, ORF8 can also serve as a priming agent for the canonical inflammasome pathway to evoke a prompt pyroptosis in the presence of second signal molecules such as extracellular ATP from damaged cells.</p><p id="P23">To validate the dual roles of ORF8 in the activation of canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways, we examined ASC speck formation in ORF8- or LPS-treated THP-1 cells by immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, ORF8 alone was insufficient to induce ASC speck formation. However, distinct pre-nuclear ASC specks were readily detected when nigericin or extracellular ATP was also present. In addition, the NLPR3 protein was also co-localized with ASC protein to the specks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), ASC speck formation always precedes cell pyroptosis in our system, and ORF8 is slightly more robust than LPS in mediating ASC formation in the presence of nigericin or extracellular ATP. The results confirm the dual roles of ORF8 in the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway when the second signal is absent, and the canonical inflammasome pathway by priming the cells when the second signal is present. These data further suggest that the mode of action of ORF8 is dependent on the presence or absence of a second signal such as extracellular ATP released from damaged cells/tissues nearby.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Blood ORF8 protein levels correlate with the mortality and disease course of severe patients with COVID-19</title><p id="P24">Having demonstrated that ORF8 is secreted as a glycoprotein and capable of inducing inflammatory cytokine responses <italic>in vitro</italic>, we then asked if ORF8 is also secreted and glycosylated in blood from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. By analyzing serum samples collected from patients within 4-7 days of COVID-19 diagnosis using Western blotting, we found that ORF8 protein was readily detected at various levels in 92% (23/25) of newly infected patients. Interestingly, two other major secreted proteins NSP9 and NSP10 were not detected in the same samples suggesting not all the secreted SARS-CoV-2 proteins are present at detectable levels in blood circulation. To determine the glycosylation status of the serum ORF8, we compared the sizes of ORF8 from patients and HEK293 lysate. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>) show that patient serum ORF8 is indeed glycosylated when compared to the ORF8 from HEK293 lysate which has an extra Strep-II tag (28 aa) and possibly an uncleaved signal sequence (16 aa). Due to the lack of a quantitative assay, we were unable to determine the absolute quantity of ORF8 in patient samples; however, our semi-quantitative Western blot could readily detect ORF8 in as little as four microliters of patient serum suggesting the protein is present at significant levels in patient blood at the onset of COVID-19.</p><p id="P25">Given its activity in inducing inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>, and its significant presence in the blood of newly infected patients, we then asked if the levels of ORF8 protein would correlate with disease severity and outcome. To that end, we examined the correlation between blood ORF8 levels and patients’ survival outcomes in our cohort of 25 hospitalized patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref> shows that after 120 days of follow-up, all seven fatalities were exclusively associated with the ORF8-high group (scored 2+ or 3+ on Western blot) while all patients in the ORF8-low group (scored 0 or 1+) had mild symptoms and quick recovery without any events of death. These results demonstrate a clear correlation between the ORF8 load and disease severity in newly infected patients. We then monitored the ORF8 levels at various time points during the disease course in two patients with prolonged COVID-19, and one patient with long covid lasting more than 17 months. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>, two patients with high blood ORF8 levels had persistent severe symptoms requiring treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), and their blood ORF8 levels diminished by the time they were recovered and discharged from the hospitals. The long covid patient with lingering symptoms throughout remained ORF8 positive in all three serial blood samples collected over 16-month period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). These results suggest that ORF8 level is prognostic for COVID-19 outcome, further supporting our hypothesis that the ORF8 protein is a pathogenic cause of severe COVID-19 in patients.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>ORF8-mediated cytokine induction is targetable by select NLRP3 inhibitors</title><p id="P26">Given its causative role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we then tested the targetability of ORF8 mediated cytokine response using three investigational NLRP3 inhibitors - MCC950, Tranilast, and OLT117 (Dapansutrile). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 showed effective inhibition on the production of IL1β in both THP-1 cells and PBMCs (blue bars), while Tranilast and OLT117 (hatched bars) exhibited moderate to marginal effect in PBMCs but no effect in THP-1 cells. Our results suggest that ORF8 mediated IL1β production can be effectively inhibited by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 at a nanomolar dose range, and possibly by other classes of inhibitors as well, demonstrating that targeting the ORF8/NLRP3 axis is a promising strategy for treating patients with symptomatic COVID-19.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Despite the success in the development and implementation of effective vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 remains a major challenge for many reasons. These include 1) a significant population remains unvaccinated, 2) new variants keep emerging and evading current vaccine protection, 3) patients with compromised immunity including those with blood cancers on immunosuppressive medications are poorly protected, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and more importantly, 4) many previously infected patients have developed lingering symptoms or long Covid. Therefore, better therapies and clinical management tools for COVID-19 are urgently needed.</p><p id="P28">SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF8, a 121 amino acid protein, is the least conserved protein in the beta-coronavirus family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Here we report that ORF8 is a major secreted viral glycoprotein <italic>in vitro</italic> and in COVID-19 patients. Our data, summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 7</xref>, support the concept that the ORF8 protein secreted from locally infected cells in the lung and released to the bloodstream then stimulates circulating CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to initiate systematic cytokine responses. This is consistent with findings by others that monocytes are the single most affected WBC subset in the blood by SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> It has been reported that about 6% of monocytes were infected with the virus in COVID-19 patients through CD16-mediated uptake of antibody-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 virus. Whether these cells were truly infected or simply engulfed with infected cells/debris remains to be seen since no live virus was detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Nevertheless, these monocytes may represent a parallel and complementary process to the ORF8-mediated inflammatory pathway described herein. Our intracellular IL1β data showed a mean of 43% (range, 7.2% - 90.7%) of monocytes that are ORF8 responsive, suggesting that the ORF8-mediated process dominates. We conclude that secreted ORF8 is a key disease-causing viral factor and can be targeted by NLRP3 inhibitors, offering a potential new treatment option.</p><p id="P29">NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation is a critical part of the innate immune response. However, the precise mechanisms for different pathogens have not been fully delineated. Our study indicated that ORF8 may enter monocytes through a non-receptor mediated ORF8 internalization, followed by lysosomal action involving lysozyme (LYZ) and cathepsin proteases (CTSB, CTSD). ORF8 then may bind to the NACHT and/or LRR domain to activate NLRP3 and recruit Casp-1 (early) and Casp-4/5 (later). It is not known what the roles of these two different bindings play, and if they are important in pathway choosing (canonical vs. non-canonical). It is also interesting that, like LPS, ORF8 induces the expression/activation of Caspase-1 early (hour 4) but switches to Casp-4/5 later (at hour 24) even when nigericin is present (data not shown). Our data shows that the mode of action of ORF8 is readily changed by the presence of the second signal leading to the switch from non-canonical to canonical inflammasomal response. Therefore, it is conceivable that, in patients with COVID-19, the inflammation may be aggravated by the additional tissue/cell damages that release ATP, leading to the activation of an ORF8-mediated canonical inflammasome pathway and causing pyroptosis.</p><p id="P30">Due to the lack of effective COVID-19 animal models, it is challenging to genetically test the pathogenic role and targetability of the ORF8 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, a SARS-CoV-2 variant (Δ382) found in Taiwan and Singapore with a complete loss of the ORF8 gene serves as a tailor-made natural genetic model that validates our findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Young et al. analyzed a cohort of 92 patients infected with the wildtype virus and 29 patients infected with the Δ382 variant and found that patients infected with the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 exhibited much higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than those infected with the Δ382 variant. Furthermore, no patients with the Δ382 variant required supplemental oxygen whereas it was required for 26 (28%) patients infected with wild-type virus. These observations provide yet another line of evidence supporting the link between ORF8 and COVID-19 disease severity, and an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic proof-of-principle for targeting ORF8 to prevent severe COVID-19 infection. Additionally, various clinical studies and trials have shown that the IL1 receptor antagonist anakinra significantly reduced the mortality risk in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe inflammation symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> The data from our present study suggests that targeting NLRP3 or ORF8 upstream of the IL1 receptor would provide greater therapeutic benefit to patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, and could also provide prophylactic benefit to patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental (methods-Tables-Figures)</label><media xlink:href="EMS141075-supplement-Supplemental__methods_Tables_Figures_.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d330aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank The Mayo Clinic Genome Analysis Core, Bioinformatics Core, Microscopy and Cell Analysis Core, and the CMM Electron Microscopy Facility of the University of California San Diego (supported by NIH equipment grant 1S10OD023527-01) for their expert service, Mayo Clinical Blood Bank for providing fresh leukocyte cones of healthy donor blood, and the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine for providing access to their biobank data.
