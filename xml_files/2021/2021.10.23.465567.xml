<abstract>
<p id="P3">Coronaviruses belong to a well-known family of enveloped RNA viruses and are the causative agent of the common cold. Although the seasonal coronaviruses do not pose a threat to human life, three members of this family, i.e., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently, SARS-CoV2, may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and lead to death. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has already caused more than 4.4 million deaths worldwide. Although much is better understood about the immunopathogenesis of the lung disease, important information about systemic disease is still missing, mainly concerning neurological parameters. In this context, we sought to evaluate immunometabolic changes using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that, besides infecting hamster’s astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 induces changes in protein expression and metabolic pathways involved in carbon metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and synaptic transmission. Interestingly, many of the differentially expressed proteins are concurrent with proteins that correlate with neurological diseases, such as Parkinsons’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease. Metabolic analysis by high resolution real-time respirometry evidenced hyperactivation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Further metabolomics analysis confirmed the consumption of many metabolites, including glucose, pyruvate, glutamine, and alpha ketoglutarate. Interestingly, we observed that glutamine was significantly reduced in infected cultures, and the blockade of mitochondrial glutaminolysis significantly reduced viral replication and pro-inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> as hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb of intranasally infected hamsters were positive for viral genome several days post-infection. Altogether, our data reveals important changes in overall protein expression, mostly of those related to carbon metabolism and energy generation, causing an imbalance in important metabolic molecules and neurotransmitters. This may suggest that some of the neurological features observed during COVID-19, as memory and cognitive impairment, may rely on altered energetic profile of brain cells, as well as an unbalanced glutamine/glutamate levels, whose importance for adequate brain function is unquestionable.</p>

<title>Graphical abstract. SARS-CoV-2 infection of Syrian hamsters’ brain impacts carbon metabolism and protein profile: a glimpse for SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological impact?</title>
<p id="P5">The presence of SARS-CoV-2 within different regions (olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cortex) of infected Syrian hamster`s brain demonstrates that the virus can avidly reach the central nervous system. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Il-6</italic>, <italic>Il-1b</italic>, <italic>Tnf-a</italic>) and interferon stimulated genes (<italic>Ace-2</italic>, <italic>Isg20</italic>, <italic>Iftm3</italic>) (<bold>a</bold>). Primary mixed glial cells infected <italic>in vitro</italic> also demonstrated dysregulated metabolic pathways such as mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis associated with an important decrease of intermediates and substrates from tricarboxylic cycle (TCA) (<bold>b</bold>). Importantly, the blockage of glutaminolysis was critical for the maintenance of viral replication (<bold>c</bold>). Finally, protein analysis evidenced that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in enriched pathways associated with neurological impacts as long-term depression, memory decline, and Parkinson’s disease, which are also found in single cell analysis of COVID-19 patients’ brains.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P6">Human coronaviruses are enveloped 30Kb single-stranded (+)RNA viruses and the causative agent of common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Six members of the <italic>coronaviridae</italic> family are capable of infecting humans, considered of low (HCoV 229E, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1 and CoV OC43) or high (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2) pathogenicity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China after the probable spill over from bats due to mutations of the spike proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Mild disease is observed in most patients, who develop fever, headache, and coughing. Some patients, however, evolve to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), characterized by lung inflammation with intense myeloid cells inflammatory infiltrate, hyaline membrane formation and alveolitis, clearly evidenced by lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. This results in dyspnea, difficult breathing, and low oxygen saturation. Most severe cases evolve with cytokine storm and systemic organ failure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, mainly in people with comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, probably either to altered immune responses or to the higher expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the lungs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Since January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020, when the WHO declared a state of emergency and international concern, more than 5,7 million people have died of COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P8">Viral particles invade host cells using its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein through the interacting with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), expressed mostly on type II pneumocytes but also on other cell types, including neurons, enterocytes and many others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Further, spike is cleaved in subunits S1 and S2 by the protease TMPRSS2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> on the surface of host cells, promoting the fusion with cell membrane for further release of the genome into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the (+) RNA strand into 16 non-structural proteins, whereas (-) RNA strands are used as template for replication and for the translation of sub-genomic RNAs. Sub-genomic RNAs are then translated into structural proteins, as spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M), that are assembled into viral particles and released to the extracellular space<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. During this process, viral RNA may be sensed by innate immunity sensors, as RIG-I<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> and MDA-5<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> leading to inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion. It triggers signaling pathways that culminate in the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines, as IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-α and type I interferons, which are exacerbated in patients evolving to cytokine storm, as reviewed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Conversely, this is associated with intense lung infiltration of myeloid cells, such as neutrophils<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> and monocytes, as well as of lymphocytes with high expression of the exhaustion markers, PD-1 and TIM-3<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Clearly, the immune response during COVID-19 has a dual role, as it may reduce viral burden, but also account for disease exacerbation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. These evidences show the complexity of COVID-19 as well as the difficulty in predicting worse disease outcomes.</p>
<p id="P9">In this context, despite being a respiratory disease, COVID-19 patients may develop several other manifestations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, including anosmia and ageusia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>, suggesting an impact in the central nervous system. In fact, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infects olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) and uses the transmucosal route to reach brain tissue<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. The neurological importance of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still a matter of debate. A retrospective study performed in Wuhan, China, from January to February 2020 analyzed 214 patients, of whom 36.4% developed neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular events and impaired consciousness<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Since then, many case reports and cohort prospective studies have been published pointing to signs and symptoms of neurological alterations that range from the anosmia and ageusia, to leptomeningitis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>, stroke, microvascular damage<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, severe headache, encephalopathy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, and even peripheral Guillain-Barré Syndrome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Histopathological analysis revealed multiple ischemic areas, encephalopathy, and microglial activation. Interestingly, recent reports have also pointed to residual psychiatric features in patients that recovered from COVID-19, as chronic fatigue, cognitive decline<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, mood disorders and depression, in the so-called “brain fog”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">Whether these are direct viral effects or indirect results of systemic inflammation is a matter of controversy, and the real impact of SARS-CoV-2 to the human brain remains elusive. In this sense, here we used <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems to evaluate immunometabolic and energetic changes using Golden Syrian Hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that the virus infects and replicates in hamster’s astrocytes and further inducing a pro-inflammatory response. Interestingly, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 shifts main metabolic pathways, specially subverting the glutamine usage for enhanced replication. Corroborating this, the blockade of glutaminolysis significantly impairs viral progeny. Also, respirometry confirmed intense metabolic activity in the presence of the virus, further corroborated by metabolomics. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we confirmed the presence of viral RNA in the cortex and hippocampus of infected animals, and consistent changes in the protein profile. Thus, here we suggest that the virus hijacks cellular carbon metabolism, especially glutamine consumption, for its own benefit, in detriment of a proper cellular metabolic function. Due to the importance of glutamatergic synapses for appropriate neuronal synapses, here we propose a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection over memory and cognitive impairment due to metabolic imbalance of important neurotransmitters, especially glutamate/glutamine. Moreover, our proteomic analysis showed a significant impact on carbon metabolism pathways consistent with brain diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and long-term depression, which were also concordant with changes observe in COVID-19 deceased patients. This brings attention to a possible correlation of altered carbon and energy metabolism with the cognitive and memory impairment observed in COVID-19 patients.</p>

The respiratory sample (naso-oropharyngeal swab) was acquired during the acute phase of infection and complying with the inclusion criteria for clinical suspicion of associated viral infection to SARS-CoV-2 adopted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil. In sum, viral stocks were generated in Vero CCL81 cells. Prior to infection, cells were maintained in DMEM Low glucose (LGC<sup>®</sup>) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco<sup>®</sup>) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (LGC<sup>®</sup>) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The initial inoculum (passage 1) was prepared to dilute the clinical samples (1:5) in non-supplemented DMEM low glucose (Gibco<sup>®</sup>). The inoculum was then added to the flask containing Vero cells and maintained for 1 hour at 37°C, following addition of fresh DMEM low glucose media supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cell culture was observed for cytopathic effects on each day after the inoculation. When a prominent cytopathic effect was observed the cell culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged to remove debris (500g), and stored at -80°C as the first viral passage. The same strategy was employed three times to obtain a fourth passage isolate. Fourth passage viral stocks were used in this study titrated by plaque-forming unit (PFU) assay, according to protocols described elsewhere<sup>

<italic>In vivo</italic> Infection of Golden Syrian Hamsters with SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P14">SARS-CoV-2 strain human/BRA/SP02cc/2020 (GenBank access number: MT350282.1) was used in the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments of this study. This virus was obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs from the first patient (HIAE01) to be diagnosed with COVID-19 in Brazil, isolated in Vero ATCC CCL-81 cells and quantified by using the Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) assay. This sample was also confirmed to be free of other common 18 human respiratory viruses using a qPCR respiratory panel (Araujo et al. 2020). A third passage aliquot was used to infected hamsters. Brain samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected hamsters from two unrelated experiments were used herein (one performed with 15–16-week-old females and another with 18-week-old males). Accordingly, conventional hamsters were acquired from the Gonçalo Muniz Institute, Fiocruz, Salvador, Brazil and maintained at the biosafety level 3 animal facility of the Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB), USP, Brazil, with food and water ad libitum. Animals were housed in pairs and groups homogenized based on weight. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the ICB and the College of Veterinary Medicine, USP (protocols #9498230321, #3147240820, #2076201020). In both experiments, animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 mg/kg of xylazine at day zero for the intranasal inoculation of 50 μl of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 suspended in DMEM with 2% FBS (infected group) or 50 μl of sterile DMEM with 2% FBS (uninfected, mock group). Hamsters were followed daily for clinical signs and weight. Subgroups (n = 3 to 5) of animals were euthanized with a combination of 5 mg/kg of morphine followed by an overdose of ketamine (600mg/kg) and xylazine (30 mg/kg) on days 3, 4, 5, 7 and/or 14 post-infection, depending on the experiment. Brains were collected aseptically at necropsy, using sterile surgical forceps and scissors, and directly placed in 50 mL falcon tubes with DMEM. Brain samples were collected from three infected female hamsters on day 3, and five infected and four uninfected hamsters on day 7. Brain samples were collected from 5 infected male animals on days 3, 5, 7, and 14, and from three non-infected hamsters on day 7.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS Analysis</title>
<p id="P18">After infection hamster astrocytes were resuspended in lysis buffer (100mM Tris HCL, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X) with freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, SIGMA®) and subjected to ultrasonication (3 cycles of 20s). Samples were submitted to the FASP protocol (Distler U., and Tenzer S., 2016). Samples had their buffer exchanged in a microcolumn tip with a 10kDa MW cut off. Tryptic digestion was performed in column. Forty micrograms of protein were used to carry out the FASP protocol, where the samples were reduced, alkylated, and later digested using trypsin. Digested peptides from each sample were resuspended in 0.1% formaldehyde. The separation of tryptic peptides was performed on an ACQUITY MClass System (Waters Corporation<sup>®</sup>). One μg of each digested sample was loaded onto a Symmetry C18 5 μm, 180 μm × 20 mm precolumn (Waters Corp<sup>®</sup>) used as trapping column and subsequently separated by a 120 min reversed phase gradient at 300 nL/min (linear gradient, 3–55% ACN over 90 min) using a HSS T3 C18 1.8 μm, 75 μm × 150 mm nanoscale and LC column (Waters Corp<sup>®</sup>) maintained at 30 °C. For the gradient elution water-Formic Acid (99.9/0.1, v/v) has been used as eluent A and Acetonitrile Formic Acid (99.9/0.1, v/v) as eluent B. The separated peptides were analyzed by High Definition Synapt G2-Si Mass spectrometer directly coupled to the chromatographic system. Differential protein expression was evaluated with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) of shotgun proteomics analysis by Expression configuration mode (MSe). The mass spectrometer operated in “Expression Mode” switching between low (4 eV) and high (25–60 eV) collision energies on the gas cell, using a scan time of 1.0s per function over 50–2000 m/z. All spectra were acquired in Ion Mobility Mode by applying a wave velocity for the ion separation of 1.000m/s and a transfer wave velocity of 175m/s. The processing of low and elevated energy, added to the data of the reference lock mass ([Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B Standard, Waters Corp<sup>®</sup>) provides a time-aligned inventory of accurate mass retention time components for both the low and elevated-energy (EMRT, exact mass retention time). Each sample was run in three technical replicates. Continuum LC-MS data from three replicate experiments for each sample have been processed for qualitative and quantitative analysis using the software Progenesis (Waters Corp<sup>®</sup>). The qualitative identification of proteins was obtained by searching in an unreviewed database <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> (Syrian Golden hamster) UNIPROT Proteome ID UP000189706. Search parameters were set as: automatic tolerance for precursor ions and for product ions, minimum 1 fragment ions matched per peptide, minimum 3 fragment ions matched per protein, minimum 1 unique peptide matched per protein, 2 missed cleavage, carbamydomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications, false discovery rate (FDR) of the identification algorithm &lt; 1%. Label free quantitative analysis was obtained using the relative abundance intensity integrated in Progenesis software, using all peptides identified for normalization. The expression analysis was performed considering technical replicates available for each experimental condition following the hypothesis that each group is an independent variable. The protein identifications were based on the detection of more than two fragment ions per peptide, and more than two peptides measured per protein. The list of normalized proteins was screened according to the following criteria: protein identified in at least 70% of the runs from the same sample and only modulated proteins with a p&lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

A pathway-protein analysis using KEGG database evidenced that the great majority of DEP correlate to carbon metabolism (Got1, Eno3, Aldoc, Tald1, PgK1, Ogdh, Pkfp, Pfk1, Gfpt), tricarboxylic acid cycle (Mdh1, Acly, Sdha, Ogdh, Dlst, Idh1, Cs, Suclg1), glycolysis (Aldoc, Gapdhs, Pgk1, Ldhb, Pfkl, Eno3, Pfkp, Eno1, Pgk2, Pklr, Aldh9a1), as well as to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Pdia3, Cryab, Dnajb11, Sec23a, Lman1, Hsph1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). Of note, these proteins are enriched in pathways that are also dysregulated in several brain diseases, such as Huntington Disease (HD), Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Nefh, Rab1a, Rab39b, Pfn1, Psma4, Psmc6, Ndufv2, Gnai3, Ap2a1, Slc25a5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, palmitate levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), further suggesting that TCA intermediates are being used as building blocks for novel biomolecules, such as lipids. Altogether, our data show an intense activation of cataplerotic and anaplerotic pathways, especially with a switch to glutamine and alfa-ketoglutarate consumption and lipid synthesis.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 replication in astrocytes is dependent on glutaminolysis</title>
<p id="P34">To further determine which specific metabolic pathway is more important in favoring SARS-CoV-2 replication, we treated infected cultures with inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism (Etomoxir, 3uM), glutaminolysis (L-DON, 50uM) and glycolytic pathways (2-DG, 5mM) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, blockade of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) did not significantly change SARS-CoV-2 replication at 24-72 hpi., further corroborated by PFU assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> right). Also, the use of etomoxir, an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), indicates low dependence of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, however, the inhibition of mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS) with L-6-Diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (L-DON), significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the release of viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Accordingly, the addition of glutamine (2mM) in the absence of glucose significantly increased viral replication, whereas glucose (17mM) was not able to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P35">Next, we evaluated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during the treatment with L-DON. Blockade of GLS with L-DON decreased the transcription of <italic>Il-1b</italic>, <italic>Il-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>), and <italic>Ifn-a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) but not <italic>Tnf-a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>) when compared to non-treated groups. This is in accordance with the reduction of the ISGs, <italic>Ace-2, Isg20</italic> and <italic>Iftm3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-J</xref>). These results evidence that glutamine is important for viral replication and the blockade of glutaminolysis reduces viral loads which in turn reduces type I IFN and pro-inflammatory responses</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb of hamsters <italic>in vivo</italic>
</title>
<p id="P36">It has already been demonstrated that the Syrian hamster is a permissive model to nasal infection with SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Thus, we decided to use this model to address whether the virus reaches important areas of the brain, such as cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb after intranasal infection with 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>, as illustrated. Consistently, we confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these areas, both at 3-, 5-, 7- and 14-days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) with higher titers at day 3. We also observed increased expression of the same pro-inflammatory cytokines evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>Il-6, Il-1b</italic> and <italic>Tnfa</italic>, as well as the ISGs <italic>Isg20</italic> and <italic>Iftm3</italic>, both in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>Il-1b</italic> was increased in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), no difference was observed in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) the same was observed for <italic>Il-6</italic> which is increased the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) but not in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). As expected, proteomic analysis of these brain samples showed that in the hippocampus, DEPs correlated with pathways of oxidative phosphorylation, long-term potentiation, dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the cortex, DEPs correlated with important neuronal function, as synaptic vesicle cycle, dopaminergic and GABAergic synapses, as well as to neurological features of brain diseases, as Parkinson’s disease and long-term depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). To further confirm whether these changes are in accordance with those observed in human COVID-19 patients, we compared the DEPs from our <italic>in vivo</italic> proteomic analysis with a data set from the literature that analyzed more than 64,000 single cells obtained from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus of 8 deceased COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). We found a strong convergence of important signaling pathways enriched in both datasets, such as those for metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors, Wnt signalling and adrenergic activation. Also, important physiological processes were related between hamster and human samples, as synaptic vessel trafficking, glycolysis, and inflammation, which were further consistent with the enrichment of DEPs correlated to brain diseases, as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). We also performed qPCR for the expression of glutamate transporters and receptors in the hippocampus and cortex of the infected animals, but we detected no differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Altogether, our data support the hypothesis that important changes in protein expression and carbon metabolism is occurring in the brains of infected Golden Syrian hamsters, and these changes may share similarities to those observed in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P37">Although the great majority of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop only mild or asymptomatic disease, COVID-19 has already taken more than 5.7 million lives worldwide. Moreover, although it is essentially a lung disease, unconventional neurological symptoms have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic, from mild anosmia and ageusia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, to more severe neurological cases of encephalitis, cerebrovascular disease, ataxia and seizures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. Most recently, the description of the “long COVID-19” and the “brain fog”, still intrigues physicians and researchers, as cases of cognitive impairment, memory impairment, disorientation and depression have been increasing, evidencing the complexity of the disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P38">In this context, here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects the central nervous system of Syrian hamsters, <italic>Mesocricetus auratus, in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. More importantly, we observed that the infection actively changes both metabolic and proteomic profile. Proteomic analysis of primary astrocytes in vitro, as well as dissected cortex and hippocampus in vivo, demonstrated relevant changes in proteins related to carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). This was further corroborated by the overall increase in glycolysis and oxygen consumption assessed by respirometry, which has already been demonstrated in mononuclear cells and lung epithelial cells. Conversely, KEEG pathway analysis evidenced a conversion to pathways enriched in neurological diseases such as Huntington disease, Parkinson disease and long-term depression, whose symptoms are similar to those observed in many COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p id="P39">The fact that viruses actively hijack cellular metabolism is well known, as for CMV, HSV, HIV, vaccinia virus, and many others, as reviewed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. This occurs either to facilitate viral replication and virion assembling or to evade local immune responses. Although the presence of replicating SARS-CoV-2 in human brains is still a matter of debate, its impact on neurological function, as memory and cognition, has become unquestionable. In this sense, the relevance of glutamatergic synapses for appropriate brain function is fundamental, as more than 90% of excitatory synapses are mediated by glutamate ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Due to its importance, glutamate is constantly recycled within the cell, either as a neurotransmitter, as glutamate and aspartate, and transported to pre-synaptic vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters (Vglut), or following its conversion from glutamine to glutamate and then to alpha-ketoglutarate to fuel the TCA cycle during cataplerosis. This conversion is essential and happens extensively in astrocytes and neurons through the function of glutaminase. Of note, conversion from glucose and glutamine is the major source of glutamate in the brain, as very little is absorbed from the blood circulation. During certain circumstances, this balance may shift from one side to another, such as during infection or neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is clear that the balance between glutamate and glutamine plays a pivotal role in both synaptic transmission and energy acquisition for proper neuronal activity, shifting from vesicular neurotransmission to catapletorosis.</p>
<p id="P40">Consistently, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamster glial cells significantly changes the levels of glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate, as assessed by metabolomics. Also, glucose and TCA cycle components were reduced, whereas viral replication increases along with cytokine secretion. This is consistent with our previous findings in monocytes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. However, here we show that along with increased glycolysis, astrocyte infection with SARS-CoV-2, also used glutamine as a source of carbon. Interestingly, however, viral replication was independent of glycolisys, as 2-DG treatment did not impact viral replication. However, here we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication depends on glutamine, as the blockade of glutaminolysis with 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) significantly reduced viral replication, and consequently, the production of inflammatory cytokines. This is also consistent with recent reports showing that SARS-CoV2 infection alters the expression of many TCA cycle proteins as well as their metabolites in lung epithelial cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it seems clear that SARS-CoV-2 impacts the overall status of protein expression, specifically of those involved in carbon and energy metabolism. And these changes as pivotal for proper brain function.</p>
<p id="P41">Among the symptoms observed in patients with long-covid are cognitive impairment, memory decline, and confusion. Conversely, hippocampal glutamatergic neurons as well as a balanced concentration of glutamate or amino acid transporters in the synapses are pivotal for long term potentiation and memory<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it is suitable to speculate that during COVID-19, glutamine consumption due to viral hijacking of cellular metabolism may affect glutamate/glutamine balance, and thus leading to the neurological symptoms mentioned. In fact, it has already been shown that SARS-CoV-2 changes the expression of excitatory amino acid transporters as SLC1A3 in COVID-19 patients astrocytes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>, which is important for the recapture of synaptic glutamate. Corroborating this hypothesis, a recent case report investigated a 29 years old COVID-19 patient that developed transient attention deficit and memory problems. Conversely, Magenetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) for the analysis of glutamate, glutamine and N-acetyl aspartate clearly showed a reduction of these molecules in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is corroborated by our findings. Interestingly, three months after infection, neurological impairment has stope as well as glutamate/glutamine levels were reestablished<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P42">Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 over the metabolic and proteomic profile of brain cells, specifically astrocytes. Moreover, we show that SARS-CoV-2 benefits from glutamine as an important source of energy, which in fact has already been shown for vaccinia virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup> and cytomegalovirus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup> in distinct cellular populations. Moreover, our proteomic analysis of hamster’s brains <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to human single cell RNAsequencing corroborates the importance of the metabolic and energetic imbalance of glutamate/glutamine that may take place in the brain of neurological in COVID-19 patients. Our data brings attention not only to the physiology of the COVID-19 brain but also suggesting that glutamate signaling may be target of specific therapies in patients that develop neurological impairments, as memory loss and cognitive decline, as already discussed elsewhere<sup>

<p>Immunofluorescence of primary astrocytes stained for GFAP (green), IBA-1 (red) and MAP-2 (green) for culture characterization. Results expressed as percentage of immunoreactive cells for each cell type (GFAP-astrocytes, IBA1 – microglia, MAP2 – neurons) over the total number of cells labeled with DAPI per field ± SEM. Minimum of 5 to 10 fields per coverslip from three independent experiments were analyzed. Scale bar = 50μm (A). Viral RNA (B) and infectious particles (C) were detected in cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 by qPCR and PFU assay, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed by multiple <italic>t</italic>-tests and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Transmission electron microscopy of astrocytes infected with MOI 0.1 at 72hpi (D). Black arrows indicate SARS-CoV-2 particles attached to the cell surface and red asterisks indicates double-membrane vesicles.
