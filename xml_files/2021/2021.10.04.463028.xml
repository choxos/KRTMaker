<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS CoV-2 variants raise significant concerns due to their ability to cause vaccine breakthrough infections. Here, we sequence-characterized the spike gene, isolated from a breakthrough infection, that corresponded to B.1.617.3 lineage. Delineating the functional impact of spike mutations using reporter pseudoviruses (PV) revealed that N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific E156G/Δ157-158 contributed to increased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Covishield™)-elicited neutralizing antibodies. A six-nucleotide deletion (467-472) in the spike coding region introduced this change in the NTD. We confirmed the presence of E156G/Δ157-158 in the RT-PCR-positive cases concurrently screened, in addition to other circulating spike (S1) mutations like T19R, T95I, L452R, E484Q, and D614G. Notably, E156G/Δ157-158 was present in more than 85% of the sequences reported from the USA, UK, and India in August 2021. The spike PV bearing combination of E156G/Δ157-158 and L452R further promoted infectivity and conferred immune evasion. Additionally, increased cell-to-cell fusion was observed when spike harbored E156G/Δ157-158, L452R, and E484Q, suggesting a combinatorial effect of these mutations. Notwithstanding, the plasma from a recovered individual robustly inhibited mutant spike PV, indicating the increased breadth of neutralization post-recovery. Our data highlights the importance of spike NTD-specific changes in determining infectivity and immune escape of variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">There was a substantial rise in the number of COVID-19 reported cases in India after March 2021, reaching more than 400000 cases per day <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The extent of spread was attributed to fitness conferring mutations in the parental lineage B.1.617, leading to the emergence of sublineages like B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and B.1.617.3 of SARS CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The delta variant belonging to B.1.617.2, detected in December 2020, dominated during the second wave in the country<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. This emergence of variants coincided with the vaccination drive, prioritized for the frontline workers, older population with subsequent rollouts in high-risk groups and young adults. While the frontline workers mostly received both doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield™ in India) by March 2021, highly transmissible delta and delta plus variants displayed the ability to cause breakthrough infections, challenging the vaccine efficacy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Our community surveillance analysis also identified a few cases that were classified as vaccine breakthrough infections. Rigorous testing and isolation were carried out to prevent further spread, and it became pertinent to understand the potential of the pathogen targeting vaccinated individuals.</p>
<p id="P3">SARS CoV-2 entry is mediated by the interaction of its spike (S) protein on the virions with the human ACE2 receptor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Spike protein variants harboring L452R and E484Q mutations were reported to have contributed to the pathogenicity of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Michael Rajah et al., 2021</xref>). These mutations are found in the critical receptor-binding domain that interacts with the ACE2 and is a target for neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, recent reports demonstrated diminished sensitivity of spike PV bearing L452R and E484Q to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies but a lack of synergy between these two mutations in conferring the resistance <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">While spike-focused first-generation vaccines designed based on the seeding variants have been shown to prevent symptomatic disease effectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, the ability of the delta variant, like other reported variants, was envisaged to be an attribute of spike protein that enabled the virus to evade vaccine-stimulated host defense <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Despite the restricted tropism to ACE2 expressing cells, the spike appears tolerant to mutations that confer the ability to escape humoral immunity and, by extension, the resistance to antibody treatments <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, to understand the molecular determinants in the spike protein responsible for reduced vaccine effectiveness, we cloned and sequence-characterized the spike gene from a vaccine breakthrough infection case. The spike nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a series of mutations that we functionally characterized using reporter PVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Mishra et al. 2021</xref>). We observed that amino acid changes in the B.1.617.3 SARS CoV-2 spike NTD contribute to increased infectivity, resistance to vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies, and cell-to-cell fusion.</p>

<title>Spike gene from breakthrough infection harbors a six-nucleotide deletion</title>
<p id="P5">During our surveillance study, we identified a previously uninfected, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield™) fully-vaccinated case that was infected 50 days after the second dose. In an effort to map the spike mutations that plausibly enabled the virus to dampen the host defense, we PCR amplified a full-length gene from the reverse transcribed RNA. Primer walking utilizing Sanger sequencing followed by analysis resulted in the contigs that were assembled, and mutations were scored to comprehend the origin of the spike protein variant (termed hereafter ICS-05). We first compared the spike sequence from the initial Wuhan isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1a</xref>; Supplementary figure-1). We found a total of eight changes; three were in NTD (N- terminal domain), four in RBD (receptor binding domain), and one on the S2 portion of ICS-05 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1a</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a six-nucleotide deletion that resulted in the loss of two amino acids at 157 and 158 positions and a change of Glutamic acid at 156 positions to glycine (E156G/Δ157-158) (Supplementary figure-1). This deletion we found in five of the total seven spike sequences isolated from the RT-PCR positive cases (Supplementary figure-1). Out of these five cases, two were fully vaccinated. When the ICS-05 spike sequence was aligned with the available spike sequences on GISAID<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>, it corresponded to the B.1.617 lineage, specifically with B.1.617.3 of the delta variant of concern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1b</xref>). Surfaced in the month of March 2021, the delta variant dominated the second wave in the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1c</xref>) and was reported to have caused 25.3% of breakthrough infections <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The E156G/Δ157-158 mutation, first detected on 7<sup>th</sup> August 2020, subsequently became 35% prevalent worldwide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1d</xref>), and by August 2021, it was found in more than 85% of reported sequences from the USA, UK, and India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1f</xref>). The E156G/Δ157-158 mutation has been detected with high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1e</xref>) in at least 157 countries and is found in multiple PANGO lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Abdel Latif 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017</xref>). Given the higher prevalence worldwide and in the most affected countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1d, 1f</xref>), we hypothesized a functional relevance of E156G/Δ157-158 mutations.</p>
<p id="P6">We first examined the spike protein in the structural context of E156G/Δ157-158 for clues regarding the alteration of epitopes. Interestingly, mapping of E156G/Δ157-158 on the structure of wild-type spike protein shows that the mutated region is surface exposed, which might be a good target for antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1g</xref>). Further to understand the effect of these mutations on spike protein structure, we predicted the structure of NTD bearing E156G/Δ157-158 using the AlphaFold<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. The resultant model of a mutant-spike protein does not show any significant changes in the NTD of spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1h</xref>), suggesting resistance to neutralizing antibodies may not be attributed to structural changes.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>E156G/Δ157-158 contributed to attenuated susceptibility to neutralization and promoted infectivity</title>
<p id="P7">To appraise the exact potential of the NTD bearing E156G/Δ157-158 and changes in the region important for the receptor binding, we introduced the indicated mutations on the reference D614G spike by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2a</xref>). Next, we assessed the effects of these spike mutations on the infectivity of PV following our earlier report <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The lentiviral spike PVs carried a luciferase gene, and the values were represented after normalizing to the milli units of reverse transcriptase (RT mU). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>), while the RBD-specific mutation E484Q did not significantly confer infectivity advantage to the spike particles, the L452R mutation increased the infectivity more than two-fold in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Interestingly, the spike bearing E156G/Δ157-158 mutation was almost equally infectious compared to the L452R mutant, indicating a potential change in the NTD that contributed to increased PV infectivity. The remaining mutations examined (T19R, T95I, T19R/T95I) did not significantly confer infectivity advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2b</xref>). Western blotting from the producer cell lysates and purified virions indicated that all these spike protein mutants were expressed, and there was no noticeable effect on the spike processing or virion incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Next, we examined the susceptibility to neutralization of indicated spike PV to vaccine-elicited plasma polyclonal antibodies from test-negative individuals. With the D614G as a reference, the NT<sub>50</sub> values obtained showed that spike PV carrying E156G/Δ157-158 mutation was 4.85-fold less susceptible to vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2d</xref>), indicating the role of this mutation in escaping the vaccine-elicited antiviral immunity in addition to promoting virion infectivity. The other indicated mutations did not confer noticeable resistance in these conditions except the L452R mutant bearing PV that required a 2.36-fold higher plasma for neutralization, consistent with the previous findings <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2b and 2c</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest the contribution of the NTD-specific mutations in conferring resistance to neutralization and promotion of infectivity.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>E156G/Δ157-158 and L452R additively effects immune escape and increased infectivity</title>
<p id="P10">Plasma polyclonal antibodies post-recovery were capable of neutralizing the ICS-05 spike PV despite the presence of mutations (Supplementary Figure-2), suggestive of the increased breadth of neutralization. For delineating key events shaping the escape from polyclonal neutralizing responses, we compared the effect of combinations of these select mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) on PV neutralization by vaccine-elicited antibodies. Specifically, we asked if different mutations acted in synergy in the antibody evasion process. The ability of E484Q and L452R to evade BNT162b2 Pfizer mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies has been established recently <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. We combined the NTD-specific change E156G/Δ157-158 with E484Q and L452R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3a</xref>) and performed the infectivity and neutralization assays. Irrespective of the background (E484Q or the L452R), NTD-specific mutation E156G/Δ157-158 increased the infectivity ~4-fold for the spike pseudotyped lentiviral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3b</xref>). Western blotting experiments revealed that these mutant spikes were enriched almost equally in the virions; however, the expression of E156G/Δ157-158/ L452R/E484Q and ICS-05 spike in the cell lysates was not comparable with other counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3c</xref>). The expression discrepancy might be attributed to a specific condition that is needed to solubilize these mutants. Nevertheless, we see that the virion incorporated fraction was similar for all mutants, including ICS-05, indicating that the associated phenotypes are unlikely affected. Notably, the reduced susceptibility to neutralization observed for the ICS-05 spike (11-fold) was mostly conferred by a combination spike-mutant that harbored E156G/Δ157-158 and L452R (7-fold less susceptible to neutralization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To further understand the reduced susceptibility to neutralization upon alterations in the NTD of the spike, we explored known complex structures of spike with antibodies. There are two major classes of antibodies; one binds with the NTD region, whereas another binds with the RBD domain of spike protein. The structure of antibodies bound to RBD and NTD domain of spike reveals that the neutralization escaping mutations described in this study are present at the interface of antibody and NTD and/or RBD domain of spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3e</xref>). This observation is consistent with our neutralization assay results which shows that mutations in these regions affect PV sensitivity to neutralization. Altogether, we observed that these mutations in NTD, particularly E156G/Δ157-158, cooperated with the seeding changes in the RBD, like L452R, for neutralizing antibody escape.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Cell-to-cell fusion is enhanced by the NTD and RBD specific amino acid changes</title>
<p id="P12">The pathogenicity of SARS CoV-2 is also attributed to spike-dictated formation of syncytia, a phenotype characterized by cells with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. This feature has been more pronounced with delta variants <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Cell-to-cell fusion also offers an avenue for evasion of humoral responses and rapid viral dissemination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Our analysis revealed that E156G/Δ157-158 together with L452R conferred most of the resistance to antiviral immunity elicited by vaccination. We next asked if these amino acid changes also promoted cell-to-cell fusion leading to syncytium formation. We designed assays that revealed the ability of the cells expressing indicated spike mutants (Red) to fuse with bystander ACE2 expressing cells (Green). While E156G/Δ157-158 alone had an indiscernible effect on syncytium formation, the area after cell-to-cell fusion was markedly increased when the cells expressing D614G spike bearing E156G/Δ157-158, L452R, and E484Q mutations were co-cultured with ACE2-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure-4a and 4b</xref>). These results indicated the increased ability of the ICS-05 spike is conferred by NTD- and RBD-specific changes that acted in concert to promote syncytium formation.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">Little is known about the functional consequences of NTD-specific changes in the spike of emerging SARS CoV-2 variants. In contrast, RBD-specific changes in the spike have been considered a defining feature that confers fitness to the virus. Here, we demonstrated that molecular features of the spike (like L452R and E484Q), already known to confer fitness <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, cooperates with alterations in the NTD to enhance spike function further. The now widespread NTD-specific mutation E156G/Δ157-158 likely conferred an evolutionary advantage and might underly vaccine breakthroughs found common during the delta outbreaks <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. One of Delta's siblings, a variant called Lambda that, like Delta, also carries changes in the spike NTD, in addition to L452Q, and these alterations have been linked to the virus' higher infectivity and immune evasion ability <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. In agreement with these observations, we found that the ICS-05 spike carried mutations in the NTD coding sequence and that these changes indeed acted in concert in evading antiviral immunity elicited by the vaccine and contributed to increased infectivity. Furthermore, consistent with the previous reports, we also observed ACE2 expressing cells forming larger syncytia when mixed with spike-expressing cells, particularly ICS-05 spike <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. It has been found that the extent of syncytia formation in SARS CoV-2 infected patients' lungs positively correlates with disease severity and higher mortality <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Our observations that E156G/Δ157-158, L452R/E484Q mutations bearing spike induced large syncytia formation, almost equivalent to that of ICS-05 spike, exemplifies NTD and RBD-specific changes that together can further promote cell-cell fusion.</p>
<p id="P14">Our analysis identified a six-nucleotide deletion in the ICS-05 spike isolate from a breakthrough infection case, concurrently found in more cases regardless of the vaccination status. The prevalence of this deletion in the sequences reported worldwide and in the most affected countries suggests its impact on virus transmission. Out of the seven cases that were screened, two were fully vaccinated and carried spike E156G/Δ157-158 mutations. We used plasma collected from frontline workers who were vaccinated on the same day/place and received two doses at identical intervals. The variability observed in the neutralization profiles using PVs, however, was expected as it basically reflects differential antibody responses between various individuals.</p>
<p id="P15">One of the limitations was that we did not have access to the plasma from before infection to appreciate the vaccine efficacy for the subject case. Furthermore, undoubtedly, the sample size would have further strengthened the study. However, we could not have had more samples that were matched for geographical location, the time intervals between the two doses (later on changed) given the limited numbers of vaccinated individuals then. Within these limitations, our results have important implications suggesting the possibility that NTD specific changes, like the ones reported here, might be driving the spread of variants.</p>
<p id="P16">We have confirmed that the L452R mutation in the RBD, prevalent in the Delta, Lambda, and epsilon variants, contributes to enhancing infectivity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. The Delta and Lambda variants under VOI and VOC, respectively, do not alone rely on the higher infectivity for spread but also showed immune evasion from the vaccine-induced antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, the Epsilon variant is now removed from the VOC/VOI list because of its low spreading capacity, although being more infectious than the spike bearing D614G. This suggests that higher infectivity alone is not sufficient for the spread. As shown here, the combined effect of E156G/Δ157-158 and L452R mutations that maintain higher infectivity and reduced neutralization susceptibility may underlie a particular variant's dominance.</p>
<p id="P17">The growing evidence that NTD-specific mutations are modulating antigenicity requires immediate attention. Some NTD targeting mAbs, isolated from recovered patients, have been structurally characterized <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Recent studies functionally evaluated the mutations in NTD of spike protein that help the virus transmit better and escape from neutralizing antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. As observed from the sequencing data on GISAID, several sequences belonging to emerging variants are found with a deletion/mutation in the NTD region of the spike. Multiple beta variants contain three amino acid deletion LAL242-244 NTD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, which does not change the neutralization effect of antibodies, but specific antibodies like 4A8 targeting the NTD are shown not to neutralize the virus bearing these changes in the spike <sup>

</sup>, Most recently, the lambda variant possessing the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation in NTD have been shown to confer resistance to vaccine-elicited antibodies, particularly antibodies targeting the NTD "supersite" <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. In agreement with these reports, we show that, under immune pressure, the SARS CoV-2 spike can use mutations in NTD, along with the RBD, to escape polyclonal neutralizing responses.</p>
<p id="P18">Vaccine rollout programs coincided with the emergence of genetically distinct SARS CoV-2 variants. Right now, the extent to which spike mutations will enable these variants to evade vaccine-elicited immunity remains to be determined. Thus, more such studies aimed at understanding phenotypic impacts of globally circulating spike amino acid changes can inform the development of next-generation vaccines and mAbs.</p>

<title>Cell Culture and reagents</title>
<p id="P21">HEK293T cells (ECACC) were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. ACE2+ cells were generated by Lentiviral transduction of HEK293T cells and were selected on the hygromycin. Reagents details are provided in the supplementary table-II.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S12">
<title>Pseudovirus production</title>
<p id="P22">HEK293T cells (3×10<sup>6</sup> cells) were seeded in a 10cm<sup>2</sup> plate 24h before transfection for the spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses production. The cells were co-transfected, with pScalps Zsgreen Luciferase (8μg), psPAX2 (6μg), pcDNA 3.1 bs(-) N protein-encoding plasmid (2ug) and either 2μg of the parental spike (D614G) or its derivatives plasmids, by calcium phosphate transfection method <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The cells were replenished with a fresh medium after 16h of transfection. The supernatant containing the viral particles was collected 48h post-transfection. The supernatant was centrifuged at 300g for five minutes and passed through a 0.22μm filter to remove cell debris. The viruses were quantified using an SGPERT assay <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. To check the virion incorporation of spike protein, the supernatant containing viral particles was overlayed on top of sucrose (20%) cushion and centrifuged at 100,000xg for 2h at 4°C. After centrifugation, supernatant was removed completely, and the virus pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 10mM TCEP as a reducing agent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S13">
<title>Transduction and infectivity measurement</title>
<p id="P23">All the infectivity experiments were performed in 96-well plate formats with 40-60% target cell confluency. For infectivity experiments, HEK293T ACE2+ cells were seeded 24h before transduction. The transduction was done in quadruplicate with dilutions (Undiluted, 1:5, 1:25, 1:125) of pseudotyped virus preparation as described earlier <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. The cells incubated with a growth medium with heat-inactivated FBS alone were considered as the control. The level of transduction was quantified using Luciferase assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Luciferase assay</title>
<p id="P24">The luciferase assay was performed to quantify the level of transduction by spike variants lentiviruses. For this, the growth medium was removed from each well, and cells were washed with 1XPBS. Further, 100μl of lysis buffer was added to each well to lyse transduced cells at room temperature for 20 minutes. 50μl of lysate was transferred to a white 96-well plate and finally mixed with the 50μl of the substrate solution, and enzyme activity was measured using spectramaxi3X (Molecular Devices, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S15">
<title>Collection of plasma and pseudovirus neutralization</title>
<p id="P25">For obtaining plasma, 5ml of venous blood sample was collected in EDTA containing vials and mixed gently by inverting multiple times to avoid coagulation. Further, the tubes were centrifuged at 200g for 15 minutes at 4°C in a swing-out bucket. The plasma layer above the PBMCs was collected as a source of antibodies. All the plasma samples used in the study were heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 minutes) to disrupt complement components. The plasma of the individual, who got two doses of Covishield and became COVID-19 positive, was collected after the RT-PCR negative report post-recovery. The plasma from test-negative vaccinated individuals who got both doses of the Covishield vaccine was collected after 30 days of vaccination.</p>
<p id="P26">To check the neutralization potential of antibodies, present in the plasma of vaccinated (Covishield) and a vaccinated individual post-COVID-19 recovery, the various amount (μl) of plasma (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001) were incubated with equivalent Spike PV for 20 minutes at room temperature before challenging the HEK293T ACE2+ cells. Transduction efficiency was measured after 48h by luciferase assay as described.</p>

<sec id="S16">
<title>Cell-to-cell fusion assay</title>
<p id="P27">For studying fusion of ACE2 expressing cells with spike expressing cells, we seeded HEK293T cells in 24 well plates at 70-80% confluency and co-transfected separately each well with Tag-RFP 657 (50ng) along with spike protein expressing vector (500ng) harboring indicated mutations. Separately, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pEGFPN1 (50ng) and ACE2 expressing vector (500ng). After 10h of transfection, cells were trypsinized, mixed at 1:1 ratio (Spike: ACE2), and seeded in 96 well plates. After 48h of transfection, cells were counterstained with Hoechst. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and washed thrice with PBS to remove PFA and taken for imaging using Thermo Scientific CellInsight CX7 High-Content Screening (HCS) Platform. To calculate spike mutation's effect on syncytium formation, five different fields were randomly chosen, and the area of fused cells was measured using ImageJ software.</p>

<sec id="S17">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="P28">The expression of spike protein mutants was checked from the virus-producing HEK293T cells. After 48h of transfection, cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 2x PIC (protease inhibitor cocktail) and 50mM TCEP at 4°C for 30 minutes. Further, the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 17000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The viral particle lysate and cell lysate were run on the 8% Tris-Tricine PAGE gel following mixing lysates with 4X Laemmli. Thereafter, proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, Merck-Millipore). After the electrotransfer, the membrane was blocked with the membrane blocking reagents (Sigma) followed by primary and secondary antibody incubations for one hour at room temperature, each of which was followed by three washes with TBST. For the p24 and beta-actin detection anti p24 (NIH ARP), rabbit anti-beta actin (LI-COR Biosciences, Cat# 926-42210, RRID:AB_1850027), for SARS CoV-2 spike detection mouse anti-spike (Cat# ZMS1076, Sigma Aldrich) respectively, were used as primary antibodies. The IR dye 680 goat anti-mouse was used as a secondary antibody for the anti-spike antibody. The IR dye 800 goat anti-mouse, or IR dye 800 goat anti-rabbit (LI-COR Biosciences Cat# 925-68070, RRID:AB_2651128, and LI-COR Biosciences Cat# 925-32211, RRID:AB_2651127) were used against primary p24 and beta-actin antibody respectively.</p>

<title>Sequence characterization, geographical prevalence, and structural significance of spike mutations.</title>
<p>a. Schematics of spike protein representing the mutations in the S1 and S2 domains. Different regions of spike proteins are indicated: NTD (N-terminal domain), RBD (receptor binding domain), FP (fusion peptide) HR1 &amp; 2 (heat repeat 1 and 2), TM (transmembrane region). b. SARS-CoV-2 complete sequences (2788) from GISAID were checked for quality on Nextstrain. The maximum likelihood tree was interpreted using Fig-tree. The multiple alignments were performed using nextstrain pipeline on these 2788 complete genomic sequences of SARS CoV-2. Branch lengths denoted the number of nucleotide substitutions from the root of the tree. The key lineages were colored eggplant B.1.617.1, yellow B.1.617.2, turquoise B.1.617.3. c. Bar-graph indicates the frequency of Delta variants during the second wave in India. The yellow color bar shows the total number of SARS COV-2 sequences submitted each month (denoted on the x-axis), and the blue bar represents the number of sequences among total sequences submitted between the period of June 2020- August 2021. The data was obtained from the GISAID SARS CoV-2 database (outbreak.info). d. Bar-graph represents the prevalence of E156G/Δ157-158 mutation in the indicated countries/state/worldwide. e. Occurrence of E156G/Δ157-158 in the PANGO lineages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cov-lineages.org/index.html">https://cov-lineages.org/index.html</ext-link>). f. The numbers of sequences carrying E156G/Δ157-158 were reported by indicated countries. The left y-axis represents the total number (#) of SARS CoV-2 genome sequences (blue dots), while the right y-axis denotes the percentage of E156G/Δ157-158 occurrence (red bars). The X-axis represents the months of sequence submission. g. mutations found in the spike ICS-05 are shown in the sticks (magenta) in Spike protomer (green, pdbid:7DF3). h. Superimposition of WT NTD (green, pdbid:7DF3) and E156G/Δ157-158 NTD (magenta) of the spike protein.</p>

<title>Infectivity and neutralization of spike pseudoparticles.</title>
<p>a. Schematics of the spike mutants generated to study the effect of ICS-05-specific mutations. Amino acid positions are represented with respect to the Wuhan HU-1 sequence (NC_045512). b. Infectivity profiles of the indicated spike mutant-pseudotyped lentiviruses. The infectivity was normalized to the D614G pseudotyped lentiviral particles. The data represent the mean of three replicates, and the significance was measured by one-way ANOVA multiple comparison test to analyze the difference between the groups, n=3. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ns=non-significant. c. Western blots indicate the relative expression of the indicated spike proteins bearing mutations from- the producer cell lysates and -the viral lysates. Beta-actin and p24 served as loading controls for cell lysates and viral lysates, respectively. d. The susceptibility of each spike mutant PV to neutralization by antibodies in the plasma obtained from vaccinated, test-negative individuals. The dotted red line represents the median response of each spike PV. The fold difference in response to neutralizing plasma was measured compared to the reference D614G mutant spike PV (n=6). The statistical significance was calculated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, two-tailed, nonparametric.</p>
