<abstract>
<p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the entry receptor ACE2. Although attachment factors and co-receptors facilitating entry are extensively studied, cellular entry factors inhibiting viral entry are largely unknown. Using a <italic>surface</italic>ome CRISPR activation screen, we identified human LRRC15 as an inhibitory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. LRRC15 directly binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with a moderate affinity and inhibits spike-mediated entry. Analysis of human lung single cell RNA sequencing dataset reveals that expression of LRRC15 is primarily detected in fibroblasts and particularly enriched in pathological fibroblasts in COVID-19 patients. <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>LRRC15</italic> are not co-expressed in the same cell types in the lung. Strikingly, expression of LRRC15 in ACE2-negative cells blocks spike-mediated viral entry in ACE2+ cell <italic>in trans</italic>, suggesting a protective role of LRRC15 in a physiological context. Therefore, LRRC15 represents an inhibitory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 regulating viral entry <italic>in trans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), representing a global health threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus family along with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (hereafter SARS-CoV-1) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a primary entry receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The viral structural protein spike (S), anchored on the surface of the viral envelope as homotrimers, binds to ACE2 and mediates the cellular entry of this virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The ectodomain of spike protein consists of the S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit is comprised of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The RBD of spike protein directly binds to ACE2, which induces a conformational change that facilitates virus fusion either with endosomal membrane or with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. This fusion event releases the SARS-CoV-2 genome into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Importantly, the interaction between the RBD of spike and ACE2 is critical to determine several key features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The high affinity interface between the RBD and ACE2 is associated with higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and breaks a barrier of susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in murine hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Spike protein, specifically the RBD, is the primary target antigen for COVID vaccines in the market and interfering with the interface between RBD and ACE2 is the action mechanism of the majority of existing therapeutic antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], indicating the importance of RBD and its binding to the cellular receptor for controlling SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P5">Thus far, several cellular factors have been identified to facilitate cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. However, it is unclear whether there are any cellular receptors that inhibit viral entry. Previous studies indicate that cleavage of spike protein by cellular proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsins, and furin facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Several cellular surface proteins or glycans facilitate viral entry by acting as an attachment factor, which includes neuropilin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and C-type lectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Alternative entry factors have been proposed such as AXL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and CD147 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. However, it remains to be elucidated whether any cellular entry factors regulate viral entry in a different manner.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we employed a screening method using the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technique. We generated a focused CRISPRa library, named <italic>surface</italic>ome, that covers ~6000 of all known/predicted surface proteins on the cellular plasma membrane. The <italic>surface</italic>ome screening with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein revealed that human LRRC15 (leucin rich repeat containing 15) is a novel inhibitory receptor for SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>A <italic>surface</italic>ome CRISPR activation screen identified cellular receptors for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P7">To identify host factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 entry, we performed the <italic>surface</italic>ome CRISPRa screen and investigated which cellular proteins regulate spike binding to cells. We specifically selected approximately 6000 genes encoding plasma membrane proteins that contain either single or multiple transmembrane domains or are associated with the plasma membrane. We designed a CRISPR activation library consisting of four activating single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) per gene and 1,000 non-targeting control sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A Fig</xref>). The screen was performed in a human melanoma cell line, A375, as this cell line does not express endogenous <italic>ACE2</italic> and does not interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without ectopic expression of <italic>ACE2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. A375 cells containing catalytically “dead” Cas9 (dCas9) were transduced with the sgRNA library and selected to produce a pool of cells with induced expression of individual surface proteins. We measured the binding of Fc-tagged S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike to the cells by flow cytometry. Cells exhibiting high fluorescent signal intensity were sorted and subjected to genomic DNA extraction and sgRNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Two biologically independent screen results indicated two very distinct hits; ACE2 and LRRC15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). ACE2 is reported to have a high affinity for the spike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. LRRC15 is a leucin-rich repeat domain containing protein which is an orphan cancer-associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. There is no reported role of LRRC15 in SARS-CoV-2. An IgG isotype control and anti-CD45 staining identified IgG receptor genes (FCGR2C, FCGR3B) and CD45-encoding gene, PTPRC, as the top hit, respectively, confirming that the <italic>surface</italic>ome CRISPR screening efficiently identifies cellular receptors for targeted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>LRRC15 directly interacts with the spike via the receptor-binding domain</title>
<p id="P8">To validate the screening result, we utilized two different human cell lines, A375 and HeLa. These two cell lines do not express endogenous <italic>ACE2</italic> and are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 without ectopic expression of <italic>ACE2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. A375 and HeLa cells were transduced with two individual sgRNAs for <italic>LRRC15</italic> and a single sgRNA for <italic>ACE2</italic> to induce gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A-B Fig</xref>). LRRC15-induced and ACE2-induced cells bound to the S1-Fc protein. The signal intensity in ACE2-induced cells was stronger than that of the LRRC15-induced cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). A similar pattern of protein-interaction was observed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">The interaction between LRRC15 and spike was further examined in a cell-free interaction model using recombinant proteins. An ELISA assay using recombinant LRRC15 and full-length spike indicated that LRRC15 directly interacts with the spike protein (KD = 109 nM). The affinity between LRRC15 and the spike seems to be weaker than that of ACE2 and spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Interaction with spike proteins of different SARS-CoV-2 variants was confirmed. Recombinant full-length spike proteins of <italic>α</italic> (B.1.1.7), <italic>β</italic> (B.1.351), <italic>ɣ</italic> (P.1), <italic>δ</italic> (B.1.617.2), and <italic>ι</italic> (B.1.526) variants were tested and LRRC15 interacted with all of these spike proteins with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">ACE2 is known to interact with the spike protein via the RBD but does not interact with the NTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, we identified that LRRC15 interacts with the spike in a similar way. Interaction assays in cells and in a cell-free assay using ELISA indicated that the RBD is sufficient to represent the interaction between LRRC15 and spike with a similar affinity compared to full-length S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D-E</xref>). Next, we examined whether this interaction is specific to SARS-CoV-2 or conserved in other β coronaviruses. The ELISA assay using recombinant RBD protein of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV showed that LRRC15 binds to spike of SARS-CoV-1 with similar affinity but does not interact with spike of MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D Fig</xref>). These results indicate that LRRC15 is a novel cellular binding protein for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 and directly interacts with the spike via the RBD.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>LRRC15 suppresses entry of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P11">We next investigated whether LRRC15 regulates the entry process of SARS-CoV-2. Pseudotyping a heterologous viral envelope with spike protein has been utilized to study the entry process of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. To monitor viral entry, we utilized a replication-incompetent VSV pseudovirus system that harbors the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the viral envelope and expresses GFP reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The LRRC15-induced A375 or HeLa cells were infected with the pseudovirus and the infectivity was monitored by flow cytometry. Wildtype control A375 and HeLa cells were not susceptible to the spike-pseudotyped virus, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-B Fig</xref>). ACE2 but not LRRC15 expression was sufficient to support viral entry. The VSV-G-coated pseudovirus entered into all tested cell lines with a similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-B Fig</xref>). These data suggest that LRRC15 does not function as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P12">To examine whether LRRC15 regulates ACE2-mediated viral entry, we first generated a clonal HeLa cell line stably expressing ACE2, designated as HeLa-ACE2, and confirmed the high surface expression of ACE2 and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3C-D Fig</xref>). Using this cell line, we induced LRRC15 expression with two different sgRNAs and measured the efficiency of pseudoviral entry. The increased LRRC15 expression resulted in a significant decrease in the spike-pseudotyped VSV entry, while the induction of an unrelated gene, CD45, showed similar infectivity compared to the mock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E Fig</xref>). The entry of VSV-G-pseudotyped virus was not affected by LRRC15 gene induction, indicating the LRRC15-mediated inhibition is specific to the entry of SARS-CoV-2. The inhibitory function of LRRC15 was confirmed by ectopic overexpression of its cDNA as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3F Fig</xref>). Of note, a larger reduction in viral entry was observed with the sgRNA-mediated gene induction, likely due to its higher gene expression of LRRC15 on cells compared to the cDNA overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E-F Fig</xref>). The suppressed viral entry was observed in other pseudotyped viruses containing the spike of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., α, β, ɣ, and δ) and SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C-D</xref>), as expected by their similar binding affinities with LRRC15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C-D Fig</xref>). Therefore, these data indicate that LRRC15 suppresses spike-mediated viral entry, and the binding and suppression activity are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>LRRC15 accumulates cell-attached viruses on the membrane and does not compete with ACE2</title>
<p id="P13">As SARS-CoV-2 entry is primarily dependent on ACE2, we assessed whether LRRC15 alters protein expression of ACE2. In HeLa-ACE2 cells, the level of ACE2 surface expression was unaltered by either sgRNA-mediated gene induction or ectopic cDNA expression of LRRC15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that spike-coated viruses were sequestered on the cellular surface of LRRC15-expressing cells. In the attachment assay, we measured the attachment to cells by incubating spike-pseudotyped viruses and cells on ice, allowing attachment on the cell membrane and preventing internalization of viruses. As expected, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viruses to cells was dependent on ACE2 expression and the binding was not altered by inducing a control gene, CD45. Importantly, viruses were highly accumulated in LRRC15-induced HeLa-ACE2 cells (i.e., 3 to 5.5-fold increases in viral copies) compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Preincubation of soluble LRRC15 protein with spike-pseudotyped viruses partly blocked the viral entry in HeLa-ACE2 cells at high concentration, while preincubation with soluble ACE2 completely blocked the viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory function of LRRC15 may require localization to the cellular membrane and/or the cytosolic domain of LRRC15 for its functional efficiency. In summary, these results suggest that LRRC15 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by restricting the internalization of virions into the cell through binding to the spike protein on the viral envelope.</p>
<p id="P14">To test whether LRRC15 directly binds to ACE2, we utilized His-tagged-LRRC15, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and MERS-CoV spike protein and assessed their interactions with Fc-tagged ACE2. Recombinant ACE2 did not show detectable binding to recombinant LRRC15 protein or the MERS-CoV spike whereas binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike was confirmed with high affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Since both ACE2 and LRRC15 bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike, we investigated whether LRRC15 competes with ACE2 for binding on the spike protein. The interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike was measured in the presence of recombinant LRRC15 protein. Even at high concentrations, LRRC15 did not affect the spike-ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). We confirmed SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-Fc binding to Hela-ACE2 cells was not altered by gene-induction or ectopic expression of LRRC15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B Fig</xref>). Taken together, ACE2-mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 is suppressed by LRRC15 on the cell membrane through its direct binding to the RBD without competition between LRRC15 and ACE2.</p>

<title>LRRC15 is expressed in distinct cell types in human lung and is associated with pathological fibroblasts</title>
<p id="P15">To better understand the function of LRRC15 in a physiologic context, we first explored its expression in human lung samples unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Two independent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of non-COVID-19 human lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] revealed that <italic>LRRC15</italic> was predominantly expressed in a subset of fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A-B Fig</xref>). For instance, in the Tissue Stability Cell Atlas dataset, a significant proportion of fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells expressed <italic>LRRC15</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B Fig</xref>). Of note, the cell types that expressed <italic>LRRC15</italic> did not co-express <italic>ACE2</italic>.</p>
<p id="P16">Having defined fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells as the main cell types in the lung that express <italic>LRRC15</italic>, we sought to explore if any clinical features were associated with <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression in the lung. Utilizing the large cohort of human lung RNA-seq samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], we constructed a multivariable regression model between <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression and various clinical factors as predictors. Specifically, we included age, sex, diabetes (type 1 or type 2), hypertension, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and ventilator status at time of death as independent variables in the model. We observed that <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression was not significantly associated with age, sex, hypertension, BMI, smoking, or type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C Fig</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression was significantly decreased in patients that were on a ventilator prior to death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5D Fig</xref>). We note that the causality of this association cannot be ascertained due to the retrospective nature of the dataset: it is unclear whether ventilator usage leads to lower <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression, or whether patients with conditions that subsequently require mechanical ventilation have baseline alterations in lung physiology associated with decreased <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression.</p>
<p id="P17">In order to gain further insight on <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression in the lung, we calculated the correlation between <italic>LRRC15</italic> and all other genes in the GTEx lung dataset. We observed that genes such as <italic>SOX4</italic>, <italic>FRMD6</italic>, <italic>FAP</italic>, <italic>ENAH</italic>, <italic>PRRX1</italic>, <italic>CD200</italic>, and <italic>VCAM1</italic> were positively correlated with <italic>LRRC15</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5E Fig</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ACE2</italic> was negatively correlated with <italic>LRRC15</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5F Fig</xref>), which is consistent with their distinct cell type-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A-B Fig</xref>). We subsequently mapped these highly correlated genes to specific lung cell types, finding that fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells also expressed several of the genes that were positively correlated with <italic>LRRC15</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5G Fig</xref>). We further observed that <italic>MAOA</italic>, which showed the strongest negative correlation with <italic>LRRC15</italic> in the bulk lung RNA-seq cohort, was mostly expressed in alveolar type 2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">To explore the clinical relevance of LRRC15 to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we analyzed two independent scRNA-seq datasets of lungs from deceased COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Consistent with our analyses of non-COVID-19 lungs, we found that fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells had the highest levels of <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A-B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression was particularly enriched in the pathological fibroblast subpopulation. This recently identified fibroblast subset (defined by high <italic>CTHRC1</italic> expression) has been implicated as a key contributor to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and may also drive lung fibrosis in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Indeed, the relative proportion of pathological fibroblasts and intermediate pathological fibroblasts was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). Further supporting the association between <italic>LRRC15</italic> and disease-associated fibroblast cell states, there was a progressive gradient of <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression from alveolar fibroblasts (0.26%) to intermediate pathological fibroblasts (2.61%), and finally to pathological fibroblasts (4.52%).</p>
<p id="P19">Given that our experiments pointed to LRRC15 as an antiviral restriction factor, we sought to specifically investigate whether <italic>LRRC15</italic> is associated with viral burden and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. We analyzed a bulk RNA-seq dataset of lungs from COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] with high or low SARS-CoV-2 viral burden at the time of autopsy. While patients with high vs low viral burden might correspond to two distinct disease phenotypes, patients with high viral RNA load had experienced shorter duration of illness before death, suggesting that these patients had failed to control the virus and died during the acute phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. On the other hand, patients with low viral RNA load had longer duration of illness before death, consistent with a scenario in which they had successfully controlled the virus but subsequently died from sequalae of the infection. With this framework in mind, we found that expression of <italic>LRRC15</italic> was significantly higher in patients with low SARS-CoV-2 viral burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). Though the causality underlying this relationship is unclear, it is supportive of the antiviral function of LRRC15 that we have identified here. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> did not lead to significant changes in <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>), which is consistent with our prior analyses pointing to a fibroblast-specific role of <italic>LRRC15</italic> in COVID-19. Collectively, our analyses point to a model in which SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the emergence of a pathological fibroblast state with increased LRRC15 expression.</p>

<title>LRRC15 in ACE2-negative cells inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in trans</italic>
</title>
<p id="P20">Since the scRNA-seq analysis revealed that <italic>LRRC15</italic> is not co-expressed with <italic>ACE2</italic> within the same cell types in the lung, we hypothesized that LRRC15 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry into ACE2-positive cells <italic>in trans</italic>. To test this hypothesis, HeLa-ACE2 cells were co-cultured with either HeLa-control or HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells (i.e., ACE2-negative cells) and were subsequently infected with spike-pseudotyped viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). The GFP reporter signal was only detected in the ACE2+ cells, confirming LRRC15 alone does not permit viral entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A Fig</xref>). Compared to the control HeLa cells, co-culturing with HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells resulted in a significant reduction of viral entry in ACE2+ cells when co-cultured at 1:4 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). At two different titers of viral infection, the similar pattern of reduction was observed. The same trend of <italic>trans</italic>-inhibition was confirmed by the spike-pseudotyped viral infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). Co-culture of HeLa-ACE2 cells and HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells at 1:1 ratio exhibited significant restriction activities, although the magnitude of suppression is slightly weaker as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B-C Fig</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining with the co-culture model further confirmed the spike binding on LRRC15+ cells and strong co-localization of LRRC15 and spike on these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). Spike-pseudotyped virus-infected cells exhibited speckle-like staining patterns for spike. The co-culture condition with HeLa-sgLRRC15 showed that a significant proportion of spike speckles were detected on LRRC15+ cells. Most interestingly, spike speckles on the co-culture condition with HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells retained overtime without further entry progress, whereas the spike speckles rapidly disappeared in cells within 60 min in the co-culture condition with wildtype HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). These results indicate that spike-binding on LRRC15+ cells is not functional binding for entry, but for non-infectious sequestration of virions. Collectively, these results highlight the <italic>trans</italic>-inhibitory function of LRRC15 proven using a co-culture model, suggesting that expression of LRRC15 in SARS-CoV-2-non-permissive fibroblasts protects permissive cells against viral infection in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P21">In this study, we employed a <italic>surface</italic>ome CRISPRa library to identify cellular receptors for SARS-CoV-2 by staining cells with a recombinant spike protein. The <italic>surface</italic>ome screening revealed two distinct hits: ACE2, the <italic>bona fide</italic> entry receptor, and LRRC15, a novel inhibitory receptor. Binding assays using recombinant proteins in cells and in cell-free models showed that LRRC15 directly interacts with the RBD of spike with a moderate affinity (<italic>K<sub>D</sub>
</italic> = 43~148 nM, depending on domain and variant). Although ACE2 also interacts with the spike via the RBD, the interaction of LRRC15-RBD does not compete with the interaction of ACE2-RBD or stabilize it either. Further studies will be necessary to determine the interface of LRRC15-RBD at a higher resolution. Most strikingly, LRRC15 inhibited the spike-mediated viral entry not only in the same cells, but also in neighboring cells <italic>in trans</italic>, providing a unique concept of viral entry inhibition by an inhibitory receptor.</p>
<p id="P22">The inhibition of viral entry by LRRC15 represents a direct effector by interacting with the spike protein itself. The leucin-rich repeat (LRR) domain is functionally linked with sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in a number of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The LRR domain proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution including in plants, providing a prominent protection against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Given the role of LRR domains in pattern recognition, humans might develop a pattern recognition protein for certain types of coronaviruses, in this case SARS-CoV-1 and -2. The robust and specific inhibitory effect of LRRC15 on multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (but not MERS-CoV) suggests an arms race between humans and coronaviruses. While this manuscript was in preparation, LRRC15 was also identified as a SARS-CoV-2 spike binding factor in two preprints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. This demonstrates the LRRC15-spike interaction is robust and detectable in multiple cell line models. Albeit the mechanism of viral restriction is different, several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as LY6E, CH25H, and IFITMs are known to restrict coronavirus entry by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] or by interfering with endosome-mediated processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Unlike these ISGs, LRRC15-mediated inhibition of viral entry is directly mediated by interaction with the spike, which resembles PAMP receptors. LRRC15 is not induced by interferons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6D Fig</xref>). As LRRC15 redistributes adenovirus receptor (CAR) affecting the delivery of adenovirus to cells, it seems that LRRC15 may act as an antiviral factor via different modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. It remains to be elucidated whether LRRC15 requires intracellular signaling through its cytosolic domain or requires other cellular proteins for the inhibition.</p>
<p id="P23">The <italic>trans</italic>-inhibition of viral entry by LRRC15 is striking. The co-culture of ACE2+LRRC15- cells and ACE2-LRRC15+ cells exhibited a significant suppression of viral infection with spike proteins of two different SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating the antiviral effect of LRRC15 can be broad in a physiological context. During SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung of human patients, LRRC15 may promote viral control by functioning as an entry inhibitor, likely in a non-cell-autonomous manner given that <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>LRRC15</italic> are expressed in distinct (but potentially neighboring) cell types. Thus, while the emergence of a <italic>LRRC15</italic>+ pathological fibroblast population may ultimately drive the fibrotic changes observed in patients with COVID-19, these fibroblasts may initially play a protective role by contributing to viral clearance during the acute phase of infection through their expression of LRRC15 on cell surface, subsequently paving the way for the transition towards tissue repair and remodeling.</p>
<p id="P24">In conclusion, this work reveals that LRRC15 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike and represents a pattern-recognition-like inhibition of viral entry by directly interacting with the spike protein. This study provides an insight into therapeutic development and a better understanding of COVID-19.</p>

Preprocessed R objects were downloaded from the respective repositories and utilized for analysis of cell type-specific expression patterns using Seurat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>].</p>
<p id="P44">Human lung scRNA-seq datasets from deceased COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls were accessed from the Single Cell Portal of the Broad Institute. We downloaded the preprocessed data from Melms et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] (SCP1219) and Delorey et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] (SCP1052). For both datasets, we used Seurat to filter out all annotated doublets prior to investigating cell type-specific expression patterns. We also filtered out cells from non-COVID-19 patients for visualization of <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression. For the Melms dataset, we also compared the relative proportions of each of the fibroblast subpopulations among total fibroblasts, using a two-tailed unpaired Mann-Whitney test to assess statistical significance.</p>

<title>Analysis of bulk RNA-seq datasets</title>
<p id="P45">The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was supported by the Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and by NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, and NINDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Bulk RNA-seq normalized TPM matrices were accessed from the GTEx Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets">https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets</ext-link>) on March 18, 2020, release v8 and subsequently filtered to lung samples only. Gene expression data used in this study are publicly available on the web portal and have been de-identified. Detailed clinical annotations of the GTEx cohort were obtained as controlled access data through dbGaP (phs000424.v8.p2).</p>
<p id="P46">To test the association between various clinical factors and <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression in the GTEx cohort, we employed a similar approach as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], constructing a multivariable linear regression model using age, sex, diabetes (type or type 2), hypertension, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and ventilator status at time of death as predictor variables for log-transformed <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression. The resulting regression estimates were visualized as forest plots with 95% confidence intervals. To visualize <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression values after adjustment for all other clinical covariates except ventilator status, we summed the intercept and residuals from another multivariable linear regression model, omitting ventilator status as a predictor variable.</p>
<p id="P47">For analysis of genes correlated with <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression in the GTEx dataset, we computed the Spearman correlation between <italic>LRRC15</italic> and all other genes represented in the GTEx dataset. We performed multiple-hypothesis correction by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. For direct comparison of <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression, we utilized log-transformed expression values to compute the linear regression line with 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p id="P48">To compare <italic>LRRC15</italic> expression in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients with high vs low viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], we accessed the raw count data from GSE150316 and performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. We performed multiple-hypothesis correction by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
<p id="P49">To compare LRRC15 expression in lung cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 vs mock controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], we accessed the raw count data from GSE147507 and performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2 as above. For visualization purposes, we further extracted the normalized expression values for <italic>LRRC15</italic> in each of the samples and tested for statistical significance by two-tailed unpaired t-test.</p>

<p id="P50">4 x 10<sup>3</sup> HeLa-ACE2 cells and 1.6 x 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa or HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells (1:4 ratio) were co-plated per well in 96-well plates. For 1:1 ratio co-culture, 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa-ACE2 cells and 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa or HeLa-sgLRRC15 cells were plated per well. The following day, media was removed from the cells and 50 μL of pseudotyped VSV were added. After incubating 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, virus-containing media was removed and the cells were incubated in complete media for 20 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were washed once and resuspended with FACS buffer and GFP-positive cells were measured by flow cytometry using FACSCelesta (BD Biosciences). To compare GFP expressions in ACE2- and LRRC15-positive cells, pseudovirus-infected cells were stained for surface ACE2 and LRRC15 as described above with following secondary antibodies: AF405-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, #A48259) and PE-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-116-152).</p>

The following day, cells were inoculated with 75 μL of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed three times with chilled media to remove unattached viral particles and placed back to 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to allow internalization. At 0, 30, or 60 min after internalization, cells were fixed by incubation of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with recombinant anti-LRRC15 antibody (Abcam, #ab150376) and SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody [1A9] (GeneTex, #GTX632604) at 1:100, followed by incubation with 1:500-diluted Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Abcam, #ab150078) and 1:200-diluted Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam, #ab150117) for 60 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on a slide using prolong™ glass antifade mountant with NucBlue™ (Invitrogen, #P36981). The fluorescence images were recorded using a Zeiss microscope.</p>
