<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a robust B cell response, resulting in the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Here, we aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 severity on the memory B cell response and characterize changes in the memory B cell compartment between recovery and five months post-symptom onset. Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of memory B cells with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in recovered individuals who had been hospitalized with non-severe (n=8) or severe (n=5) COVID-19. One month after symptom onset, a substantial proportion of spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells showed an activated phenotype. In individuals who experienced non-severe disease, spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells showed increased expression of markers associated with durable B cell memory, including T-bet, FcRL5, and CD11c, which was not observed after severe disease. Five months post-symptom onset, the majority of spike-specific memory B cells had a resting phenotype and the percentage of spike-specific T-bet<sup>+</sup> IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells decreased to baseline levels. Collectively, our results suggest that the memory B cell response elicited during non-severe COVID-19 may be of higher quality than the response after severe disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulting in more than 4 million deaths reported worldwide as of September 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Highly efficacious vaccines have limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission and significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in regions of the world with access to these vaccines. However, the majority of the world’s population lives in areas with low vaccination rates and remain at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Both vaccination and natural infection elicit immunological protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re-)infection. Although mRNA vaccination elicits higher antibody titers and more diverse antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein than natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), results from the first longitudinal studies in unvaccinated individuals with prior COVID-19 suggest that naturally acquired immune responses are maintained for at least a year after infection and that these responses protect from subsequent re-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Because many people remain unvaccinated, it will be important to understand the immune response elicited by natural infection and whether the durability of naturally acquired immunity is influenced by the severity of disease.</p>
<p id="P3">Although SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits robust responses in both the T cell and B cell arms of the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), the majority of research efforts have focused on B cell and antibody responses, which are thought to be critical for the control of infection and protection against re-infection. Humoral immune responses against pathogens consist of multiple components. The early B cell response is dominated by short-lived antibody-secreting cells, called plasmablasts. Simultaneously, other B cell populations undergo selection for high affinity antigen-binding in germinal centers of the secondary lymphoid organs, and can differentiate into long-lived, antibody-secreting plasma cells that migrate to the bone marrow or into memory B cells that remain in the circulation (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>)). COVID-19 patients rapidly generate potent neutralizing IgG antibodies against the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Anti-spike antibody titers peak within the first two months post-infection, decline in the subsequent 3 – 4 months, and then plateau at titers higher than those detected in pre-pandemic samples, but are lower than anti-spike antibody titers elicited by vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). These phases of the anti-spike IgG profile in the circulation are the result of early short-lived plasmablast responses, followed by the secretion of antibodies by longer-lived bone marrow plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In addition, spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells are maintained or even increase in numbers for at least six months to one year following SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Analysis of monoclonal antibodies obtained from these memory B cells revealed continued evolution of the B cell response over time, as evidenced by higher levels of somatic hypermutation, resulting in increased binding affinity and neutralizing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">In recent years, novel subsets of activated B cells and memory B cells have been identified. These novel B cell subsets have mainly been defined by their phenotype, that is, the collection of markers expressed on their cell surface or intracellularly, and are thought to possess either protective or pathogenic functions in the immune response. For example, several subsets of double negative (DN; CD27<sup>-</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup>) B cells have been defined in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Type 1 double negative cells (DN1 cells), defined as DN cells that express CXCR5 or CD21 and lack CD11c and FcRL5, are transcriptionally similar to class-switched memory B cells and seem to be part of a functional B cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). On the other hand, type 2 DN cells (DN2 cells), defined as CD11c<sup>+</sup>/FcRL5<sup>+</sup> and CXCR5<sup>-</sup>/CD21<sup>-</sup> DN cells, are thought to arise from the activation of naïve B cells outside of the B cell follicle in the lymph node. Type 3 DN cells (DN3 cells), defined as CD11c<sup>-</sup>/FcRL5<sup>-</sup> and CXCR5<sup>-</sup>/CD21<sup>-</sup> DN cells, have also been associated with this extrafollicular response and may be DN2 cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). DN2 cells are more abundant in patients with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and are thought to differentiate into auto-antibody-secreting cells. DN2 cells are also observed in the circulation of patients with severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), an observation that has been linked to lack of germinal center formation, presumably leading to an impaired B cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Interestingly, memory B cells (CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup>) expressing some of the same markers as DN2 cells, including CD11c and FcRL5, as well as the transcription factor T-bet, have been described as part of normal, functional immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Specifically, these cells have been implicated in long-lived B cell memory after tetanus toxoid and influenza virus vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). In recovered COVID-19 patients, memory B cells present 1 – 3 months after symptom onset are also found to express FcRL5 and T-bet, suggesting that these markers may delineate a subset of long-lived memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, it is unclear whether disease severity influences the development of memory B cells that express T-bet or FcRL5, and whether the phenotype of memory B cells changes with the continued evolution of this B cell compartment in the months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A more detailed analysis of B cell subsets in recovered COVID-19 patients will therefore be needed to acquire insight into the early B cell response and the evolution of memory B cells over time.</p>
<p id="P6">Here, we performed spectral flow cytometry to characterize the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in unvaccinated patients who recovered from non-severe or severe COVID-19. We focused on two comparative analyses. First, we compared the phenotype of spike-specific B cells between convalescent patients who were hospitalized with non-severe and severe disease to determine whether the B cell response developed differently in these two groups. Second, we compared the phenotype of memory B cells shortly after recovery to that at five months post-symptom onset to analyze the ongoing evolution of the B cell response. The results from this study provide insight into naturally acquired B cell memory against SARS-CoV-2 and a better understanding of the characteristics of durable B cell immunity.</p>

<title>Study criteria</title>
<p id="P7">Study participants (n=16) were enrolled in the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)-1 or ACTT-2 clinical trials which were designed to evaluate the effect of remdesivir or baricitinib plus remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Participants identified predominantly as white (94%) and Hispanic (75%), and all except one individual had one or more comorbidities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Participants were classified as non-severe (n = 11) or severe (n = 5) COVID-19 cases based on their worst ordinal score for disease severity during hospital stay. In summary, non-severe cases did not require supplemental oxygen (score = 4) or required supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (score = 5 or 6), while severe cases needed invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (score = 7). The definition of severe disease was made based on the need for MV or ECMO, because this distinguishes the most critical patients, who are the most likely to develop impaired immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Blood was collected after discharge from the hospital (a median of 30 days after symptom onset for non-severe cases (n = 8) and 32 days after symptom onset for severe cases (n = 5)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For participants with non-severe disease, additional samples were collected at an earlier time point (a median of 18 days post-symptom onset; n = 9) and at a follow-up visit approximately 5 months post-symptom onset (median, 147 days; n = 7) based on availability and consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n = 3) collected before the start of the pandemic (2018 or early 2019) were used as negative controls.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>The proportions of B cell subsets in convalescent patients are similar between non-severe and severe COVID-19 cases</title>
<p id="P8">Severe COVID-19 is associated with an extrafollicular B cell response characterized by a high percentage of DN2 B cells in the circulation, similar to what is observed in patients with autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Previous data suggest that the percentage of DN2 B cells in patients with severe COVID-19 had returned to normal levels approximately 1.5 months after hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To determine whether COVID-19 severity affects the distribution of B cell subsets shortly after recovery (four to five weeks after symptom onset), we analyzed the relative proportions of B cell subsets individuals who recovered from non-severe (n = 8) or severe (n = 5) disease by spectral flow cytometry using an antibody panel against 19 cell surface and intracellular markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). B cells were first gated on live, CD19<sup>+</sup> CD20<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>-/lo</sup> cells to exclude transitional B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and were subsequently divided into naïve (CD27<sup>-</sup> IgD<sup>+</sup>), unswitched memory (CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>+</sup>), resting switched memory (CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup>), activated switched memory (CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup>) and double negative (DN; CD27<sup>-</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup>) B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Apart from a significant increase in the percentage of unswitched memory B cells in individuals who had experienced severe disease compared to those with non-severe COVID-19, no differences in the distribution of these B cell subsets were observed between the two groups of recovered COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Among DN cells, DN1 (FcRL5<sup>-</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) B cells were the dominant subset in both groups of recovered COVID-19 patients, and we did not detect significant differences in the frequencies of DN1, DN2 (FcRL5<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>-</sup>), and DN3 (FcRL5<sup>-</sup> CXCR5<sup>-</sup>) B cells between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). In combination with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), these results suggest that expansion of the DN2 B cell population during severe COVID-19 might be transient and that these cells disappear soon after recovery.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>The percentage of spike-specific and RBD-specific B cells and their isotype distributions are similar between non-severe and severe cases</title>
<p id="P9">Our flow cytometry panel also included antigen probes to detect B cells reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). RBD is the part of the spike protein that interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the viral receptor on host cells, and is the dominant target of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, the majority of antibodies generated against the spike protein bind to epitopes outside RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Whereas the RBD sequence is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), the non-RBD parts of spike, in particular the S2 subunit, share epitopes with other coronaviruses that circulate in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Evidence for pre-existing memory B cells that are cross-reactive with other coronaviruses has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Because pre-existing immunity could affect the development of the immune responses against these two parts of the spike protein, we analyzed B cell responses against RBD and non-RBD spike epitopes separately.</p>
<p id="P10">We constructed spike tetramers in two fluorochrome formats and defined the population of cells staining positive for both tetramers as spike-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The spike-specific B cells were then divided into non-RBD-specific and RBD-specific B cells based on reactivity with the RBD tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Non-RBD-specific and RBD-specific B cells were strongly enriched for antigen-experienced B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), with no statistically significant differences in the proportions of various B cell populations between individuals who recovered from non-severe or severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, reactivity against spike and RBD tetramers among control donor B cells was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,C</xref>), suggesting that these probes selectively bind to antigen-specific B cells.</p>
<p id="P11">The percentage of spike-specific B cells among antigen-experienced B cell populations (unswitched memory, switched memory, and DN B cells) among all patients ranged from 0.1% to 1.8% (median, 0.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). One donor (marked with # in Figure 3C) had only six spike-specific B cells and was therefore not included in subsequent analyses that required further subsetting of these cells. All other donors had between 42 and 450 spike-specific B cells. In line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), a median of 22% of spike-specific B cells were reactive against RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Ogega <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 harbored more RBD-specific B cells than COVID-19 patients who never required hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We did not observe a difference in the percentage of RBD-specific cells between individuals who recovered from non-severe and severe disease, potentially because our non-severe group had been hospitalized and suffered from more severe disease than the group with non-severe disease in the Ogega <italic>et al</italic>. study.</p>
<p id="P12">Next, we compared the isotype of class-switched spike-specific B cells between patients who recovered from non-severe and severe COVID-19 by categorizing spike-specific antigen-experienced B cells based on IgM, IgG, or IgA expression. The percentage of IgM<sup>+</sup>, IgG<sup>+</sup>, and IgA<sup>+</sup> class-switched B cells among spike-specific B cells did not differ significantly between the two patient groups and in both groups, the majority of class-switched spike-specific B cells were IgG<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also determined plasma IgM and IgG reactivity to the spike protein and RBD and observed no significant differences in IgM or IgG titers to the spike protein or RBD between convalescent patients who recovered from non-severe or severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that individuals who recovered from either non-severe or severe COVID-19 have similar immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in terms of the prevalence of spike-specific B cells and their major phenotype.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Non-severe COVID-19 is associated with an increased population of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells</title>
<p id="P13">To gain deeper understanding of the differences in memory B cell responses between individuals who had either non-severe or severe COVID-19, we combined the acquired flow cytometry data for all 19 markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) of all individuals and plotted a composite image using Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection (UMAP). UMAP clusters cells in a 2D plot based on similarity in phenotype and therefore provides meaningful organization of cell subsets. For each recovered COVID-19 patient, we took a random sample of cells (n = 10,000) and projected the spike-specific antigen-experienced B cells onto the composite UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also plotted contours for various B cell subsets to visualize their location within the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref> for heatmaps of all individual markers overlaid on the composite UMAP). The composite image shows differences in the location of spike-specific B cells, predominantly among IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The large majority of IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells are memory B cells, but a small fraction of these cells are DN1 B cells that are thought to contribute to a functional immune response and were therefore included in a phenotypic analysis of spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p>
<p id="P14">Irrespective of disease severity, spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed increased levels of activation markers CD80, Ki-67, and CD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) compared to all IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells, with no differences between the two groups. In contrast, spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells after non-severe disease showed an increase in the expression of the transcription factor T-bet that was not seen after severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). A median of 28% of spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells in individuals who experienced non-severe disease expressed T-bet, which has been associated with strong anti-viral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Conversely, T-bet was expressed in only about 10% of spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells in individuals who recovered from severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells often have a distinct cell surface marker profile, including expression of CD11c and FcRL5 and the absence of CD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Indeed, in addition to T-bet, the percentage of both FcRL5<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells was increased among spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells in patients who recovered from non-severe COVID-19 as compared to all IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells in these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), while these differences were not seen in individuals who recovered from severe COVID-19. Conversely, a lower percentage of CD21<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells was observed after non-severe disease but not after severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To confirm that the measurement of T-bet, FcRL5, CD11c, and CD21 expression was robust between experiments, we processed and analyzed technical replicates for samples from one non-severe and one severe case on different days, and observed almost perfect correlation between the replicates (Spearman r = 0.99, P = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). We then analyzed the combinatorial expression of these markers by combining spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells from all donors and plotting contour plots depicting the expression of FcRL5, CD11c, CD21, CD27, CXCR3, and CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This revealed four subpopulations of T-bet<sup>+</sup> IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells, of which cells expressing FcRL5, CD11c, CD27 and CXCR3, and lacking CD21 and CXCR5 (type I; activated switched memory B cells) were most abundant in both non-severe and severe cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This phenotype has previously been observed in activated B cells after influenza virus vaccination and is thought to delineate a B cell subset associated with long-lived humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Collectively, the higher prevalence of spike-specific B cells that express markers associated with durable immunity in individuals who recovered from non-severe COVID-19 than in those who experienced severe disease suggests that disease severity influences the quality of the B cell response.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells return to a resting phenotype with baseline levels of T-bet expression five months post-symptom onset</title>
<p id="P15">Activated T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cell subsets have been shown to expand and contract rapidly following influenza virus vaccination, peaking between 14 and 28 days post-vaccination and returning to baseline levels after three months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that the memory B cell response continues to mature up to one year following SARS-CoV-2 infection, giving rise to B cell clones with higher levels of somatic hypermutation and resulting in increases in antigen-binding affinity and ability to neutralize the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). To evaluate the early dynamics of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific B cells and continued development of the phenotype of memory B cells in parallel with ongoing selection and maturation, we analyzed additional blood samples from recovered COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease collected at an earlier time point (median, 19 days post-symptom onset) (T1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and at a follow-up visit five months post-symptom onset (T3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Unfortunately, we were unable to recruit any individuals who had experienced severe disease for a follow-up visit at five months post-symptom onset. In addition, at the earlier time point, most individuals with severe disease were still hospitalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We therefore limited this analysis to individuals who recovered from non-severe COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P16">The percentages of total naïve, unswitched memory, resting switched memory, activated switched memory, and double negative B cell subsets among total B cells did not differ between the two time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). However, the phenotype of spike-specific B cells changed considerably between the two early time points and five months post-symptom onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), as described in further detail below. Similar to what has been reported by Dan <italic>et al</italic>. and Sokal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), the percentage of spike-specific B cells among antigen-experienced B cells remained relatively stable at five months post-symptom onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, the reactivity against RBD among these spike-specific B cells increased between 2 – 3 weeks and 4 – 5 weeks post-symptom onset, but did not change at the 5-month time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The larger proportion of non-RBD-specific B cells early in infection may be the result of recall responses of pre-existing memory B cells that are cross-reactive with other coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P17">The percentage of antigen-experienced spike-specific B cells with an unswitched memory B cell phenotype was reduced at the 5-month time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The percentage of spike-specific activated switched memory B cells drastically decreased over time, accompanied by an increase in resting memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Among switched memory B cells, the percentage of IgM<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> memory B cells declined and the proportion of IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells increased at five months post-symptom onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). In line with the decrease of IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells, the anti-spike and anti-RBD plasma IgM responses were lost almost completely at five months post-symptom onset. Plasma IgG titers against the spike protein remained stable, whereas plasma IgG titers against RBD showed a modest decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results indicate that both the unswitched plasma cell and memory B cell response against the spike protein are short-lived, while the class-switched IgG<sup>+</sup> response is more durable, as has been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Both the decrease of unswitched memory B cells and the change from an activated to a resting switched memory B cell phenotype can be seen in composite UMAPs of the three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). In line with the return to a resting memory B cell phenotype, expression of CD80, Ki-67, and CD95 was decreased at 20 – 23 weeks post-symptom onset as compared the two earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). The percentage of CD80<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells at 20 – 23 weeks post-symptom onset still showed an increase over baseline levels (P = 0.016, Wilcoxon signed rank test), while expression of Ki-67 and CD95 had returned to levels seen in non-spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). The expression of T-bet was higher at 2 – 3 weeks post-symptom onset than at 4 – 5 weeks post-symptom onset (median, 58% and 28%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant, and decreased further to baseline levels (~ 10%) at 20 – 23 weeks post-symptom onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Similar dynamics were observed for FcRL5 and CD11c, while CD21 expression increased significantly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The percentage of type I T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells (activated switched memory B cells) that dominated the early response decreased dramatically over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Instead, the T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells present at five months post-symptom onset were mainly type II (FcRL5<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup>, DN2 B cells) and type IV (FcRL5<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup>, resting switched memory B cells) subsets, making up ~35% and ~40% of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells, respectively. These results suggest that the memory B cell response continues to evolve until at least five months after infection. In addition, the decrease of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific B cells in the circulation over the course of five months post-symptom onset suggests that their abundant presence in the blood may signify recent exposure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">In the current COVID-19 pandemic, an important question that has only partially been answered is whether SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits durable immunity. Assessments of B cell responses up to one year post-infection suggest that both neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein remain detectable in the circulation of most recovered COVID-19 patients and are stable or decay slowly at this time point. In this study, we aimed to better understand the memory B cell response and to determine whether the severity of COVID-19 disease course influences the development of B cell responses. Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of B cells reactive with both non-RBD and RBD epitopes on the spike protein shortly after recovery and approximately five months post-symptom onset.</p>
<p id="P20">Our study consisted of a relatively small number of individuals but recapitulated many of the observations reported from much larger cohorts, including the frequency of spike-specific memory B cells after infection and the fraction of spike-specific B cells that recognizes RBD epitopes. We also confirmed the loss of IgM<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> spike-specific memory B cells and anti-spike and anti-RBD plasma IgM, as well as maintenance of IgG<sup>+</sup> spike-specific memory B cells and anti-spike plasma IgG five months post-symptom onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This gives us confidence in the validity of several new observations that we discuss in more detail below.</p>
<p id="P21">The most striking result from this study is the higher percentage of spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells that express the transcription factor T-bet in individuals who recovered from non-severe disease as compared to those who recovered from severe disease. Previously, it was observed that a higher percentage of total CD19<sup>+</sup> T-bet<sup>+</sup> IgG<sub>1</sub>
<sup>+</sup> B cells was associated with shorter symptom duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Here, we determined that this association predominantly involves SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific B cells, suggesting implications for the development of B cell memory. The expression of T-bet, in parallel with a surface marker profile that includes the presence of FcRL5 and CD11c and the absence of CD21, has previously been reported on activated B cells shortly after vaccination and infection, and is associated with long-lived humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Here, we observed that an increased percentage of spike-specific B cells showed this activated phenotype shortly after recovery from non-severe COVID-19, but not after severe COVID-19. Ogega <italic>et al</italic>. reported higher FcRL5 expression on RBD-specific class-switched memory B cells after non-severe COVID-19 (non-hospitalized patients) than after severe disease (hospitalized patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), findings that are in agreement with our results. In addition, higher levels of somatic hypermutation were observed in IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells following non-severe COVID-19 than severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), while patients who died from COVID-19 showed an absence of germinal centers and a delay in the development of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Collectively, these data are indicative of functional development of B cell immunity with germinal center responses in patients with non-severe disease, as compared to a more dysfunctional B cell response in severe disease cases.</p>
<p id="P22">T-bet expression in B cells can be induced by interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling through the IFNγ receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). IFNγ plays an important role in the immune response against viral infections. Although many contradictory findings have been reported about the role of INFγ in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of INFγ early in infection seems important in the control of viral replication [summarized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>)]. Indeed, low IFNγ and low induction of interferon-stimulated genes contribute to the development of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Failure to control viral load leads to the induction of a hyper-inflammatory response later in disease, in parallel with persistent high levels of IFNγ. However, these conditions may not promote the development of T-bet<sup>+</sup> memory B cells. Instead, patients with severe disease show a strong extrafollicular B cell response, resulting in an accumulation of DN2 B cells [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)]. In our study, no difference was observed in the percentage of DN2 B cells shortly after recovery between patients with either non-severe or severe disease, suggesting that these DN2 B cells may be relatively short-lived. Of note, DN2 cells typically also express T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), highlighting that the expression of this transcription factor alone is not the determining factor in the development of either a functional or pathogenic B cell response. The difference that we observed in the percentage of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells between patients recovered from non-severe or severe COVID-19 could reflect these two developmental pathways of anti-viral immune responses.</p>
<p id="P23">In individuals who experienced non-severe COVID-19, T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells almost disappeared from the circulation five months post-symptom onset. This is in line with the transient peak of activated memory B cells observed after influenza vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The cell surface marker expression profile and dynamics of the T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells detected in this study matches best with the AM2 subset of activated memory B cells defined by Andrews <italic>et al.,</italic> which peaked 14 days after influenza vaccination and had almost disappeared 90 days post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, this does not necessarily mean that these cells are short-lived. It was recently shown that the spleen harbors a population of resident T-bet<sup>hi</sup> memory B cells with specificity to viral antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that T-bet<sup>hi</sup> memory B cells elicited in response to influenza virus vaccination rapidly differentiated into antibody-secreting cells upon reactivation one year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). T-bet<sup>+</sup> memory B cells thus seem to contribute to effective recall responses upon re-exposure, but may only be detectable in the circulation shortly after infection. In this regard, it is important to point out that the timing of sampling can strongly affect the frequency of transient B cell populations, and samples selected for comparative analyses need to be carefully matched to account for rapid changes in the abundance of activated B cell populations over time. For example, this may explain the discrepancy between this study and the observation by Sokal <italic>et al</italic>. that T-bet expression in spike-specific B cells was higher in individuals with severe COVID-19 than individual with non-severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In the Sokal <italic>et al</italic>. study, samples from severe cases were collected at an earlier time point than those from non-severe cases (median, 18.8 days versus 35.5 days post-symptom onset), which could have influenced these results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Thus far, no differences have been observed in serum anti-spike antibody titers, <italic>in vitro</italic> serum neutralizing activity, or percentages of spike-specific memory B cells between non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients in the months after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the durability of B cell memory differs between individuals who experienced non-severe or severe disease. We speculate that individuals who recovered from non-severe disease develop a higher quality memory B cell response that may be longer-lived or may give rise to a larger population of antibody-secreting cells upon re-exposure. An alternative interpretation of the paucity of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific memory B cells in patients with severe disease could be that a robust T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cell response protects against severe COVID-19. Although patients who died from COVID-19 show defects in the development of B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), it is likely that the expansion of a population of T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific memory B cells is a consequence of the immune environment during disease, not a factor contributing to survival. We believe these cells are a sign of a balanced immune response that contributes to viral clearance through the production of neutralizing antibodies and leads to the development of durable B cell memory, but that T-bet<sup>+</sup> memory B cells do not play a direct role in protection against severe disease.</p>
<p id="P25">In conclusion, we have shown that the memory B cell response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein develops differently in patients with non-severe disease compared those with severe disease, with more spike-specific B cells that express a B-cell marker profile associated with durable immunity, characterized by expression of T-bet, FcRL5, and CD11c, and low expression of CD21 in individuals who recovered from non-severe COVID-19. Although antibody titers or percentage of spike-specific memory B cells up to one year are similar or higher in individuals who recovered from severe disease as compared to non-severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), the increased percentage of B cells associated with long-lived immunity in non-severe COVID-19 patients may have consequences for long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection or severity of the resulting disease. T-bet<sup>+</sup> spike-specific B cells nearly disappeared from the circulation five months post-symptom onset, consistent with loss of these cells from the periphery or migration into tissues. These data aid in the understanding of naturally acquired B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and help characterize the B cell populations that may be responsible for durable, long-lived immunity.</p>

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the cellular fraction as described below. PBMCs used as negative controls were collected in 2018 and early 2019 by isolation from buffy coats (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, TN) obtained the day following blood draw. Buffy coats were stored and shipped at room temperature (RT) and processed immediately upon arrival. Cells were diluted approximately 4 × in PBS with 2 mM EDTA. PBMCs were layered on Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 17144002) and spun at 760 × g for 20 min at RT to pellet erythrocytes and separate leukocytes. The leukocytes were then washed in PBS with 2 mM EDTA, centrifuged at 425 × g for 15 min at RT, followed by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min at RT for all subsequent wash steps necessary to remove all platelets, determined by cloudiness of the supernatant.

The oxidation of TMB was stopped by adding 100 μl 0.18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> when the wells containing the most diluted IgG/IgM standard started to color. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Plate Reader (BioTek). The average background signal of wells incubated without plasma was subtracted from the absorbance values for each sample. All plasma samples were measured in duplicate and the average absorbance reading was used to calculate the area under the curve using GraphPad 9.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P32">Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad 9. Differences between two groups were evaluated using a Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in the expression of intracellular and cell surface markers were tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by comparisons between selected pairs of groups using Dunn’s post-hoc test, corrected for multiple comparisons. Non-parametric tests were used because the limited sample size did not allow for reliable evaluation of normal distribution and homoscedasticity.</p>

<title>Timing of sample collection.</title>
<p>Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were recruited for the study and sampled after hospital discharge. Samples from T2 were used for the comparison of B cell responses between individuals who recovered from non-severe and severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). All samples at T2 were collected 4 – 5 weeks post-symptom onset (PSO), with the exception of one severe donor who was sampled just after 5 weeks PSO (37 days). Longitudinal analysis of samples collected at T1 – T3 could only be performed for individuals who experienced non-severe disease, because the majority of severe patients were still hospitalized at T1 and we were unsuccessful in recruiting recovered severe patients for a follow-up blood draw at T3. The donor marked with * was included in the analysis of B cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the percentage of spike-specific B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), but could not be included in all subsequent analyses because only a small number of spike-specific B cells (n = 6) was detected in this sample.</p>
