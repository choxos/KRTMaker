            <p id="P1">Viral spillover from animal reservoirs can trigger public health crises and cripple the world economy. Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via engagement of ACE2, while the receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clade 2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72 and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31 appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a certain ACE2 sequence. The ACE2 protein from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic> engaged all known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a separate, unknown receptor. Our results suggest that clade 3 sarbecoviruses from Africa and Europe use <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 for entry, and their spike proteins appear primed to contribute to zoonosis under the right conditions.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p id="P2">As shown by the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, viral spillover from animal reservoirs can decimate public health systems and the global economy. The likelihoods of zoonotic spillovers are multifactorial, including both ecological and molecular factors. Human disruptions to world ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of future zoonotic events[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. We still lack a clear understanding of the molecular factors that likely play key roles during zoonosis.</p>
         <p id="P3">Molecular compatibility during viral entry is a key determinant of viral tropism and host switching[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus include known zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. These viruses use the spike glycoprotein to catalyze entry into target cells upon binding to a compatible host cell receptor. Unlike MERS-CoV which uses Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the cell surface receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], the lineage B viruses of the sarbecovirus subgenus SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. ACE2 binding from SARS-like CoVs is dictated by an independently folded domain of up to 223 residues in length, referred to as the receptor binding domain (RBD).</p>
         <p id="P4">Multiple viral clades exist within the sarbecovirus subgenus, and the cell surface receptor dependencies of each clade are not well established[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Clade 1 sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are known to utilize ACE2, while the receptors for clade 2 and clade 3 viruses are unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The lack of observed ACE2-dependent enhancement to infection by clade 2 and clade 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins, such as YN2013 or BM48-31, can be explained in three ways: 1) these RBDs have weak but functionally relevant affinity for ACE2, below the limit of detection of commonly used assay, 2) these RBDs have affinity for certain orthologs of ACE2, but little or no affinity for human ACE2 or for any orthologs that have been tested so far, or 3) these RBDs primarily utilize an entry mechanism distinct from ACE2.</p>
         <p id="P5">Here, we characterize the extent of ACE2 dependence across sarbecovirus clades. We utilized a single-copy HEK 293T genome modification platform to strongly overexpress multiple cell surface proteins proposed to serve as receptors for SARS-CoV-2, alongside the well-established receptor, ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. As the clade 2 and clade 3 sarbecoviruses were observed in samples collected from various <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats, we synthesized and expressed ACE2 orthologs from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>affinis</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alyone</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>landeri</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>pearsonii</italic>, and various ACE2 alleles observed in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic>. We observed differing patterns of ACE2 ortholog usage by various clade 3 sarbecoviruses RBDs during cell entry, including human ACE2-dependent entry by the BtKY72 and Khosta-2 RBDs. We observed little to no ACE2-dependent infection with RBDs from clade 2 sarbecoviruses, including various alleles from <italic>R</italic>.<italic>sinicus</italic> and <italic>R</italic>.<italic>pearsonii</italic> from which these viruses were isolated. Thus, our study provides a new genetic approach for characterizing receptor utilization during viral entry, and demonstrated that clade 3 sarbecoviruses likely utilize ACE2 as a cell-entry receptor during infection.</p>

            <title>Developing a robust genetic assay for viral entry</title>
            <p id="P6">Knowing that sarbecovirus spike proteins may exhibit weak affinity for ACE2 proteins from mismatched hosts, we designed an assay for measuring biochemically weak but functionally important interactions promoting viral entry. We previously developed a Bxb1 recombinase-based transgenic expression system, wherein human ACE2 or its coding variants could be stably and precisely expressed by a Tet-inducible promoter already engineered into the cell genome, upon integration of a single promoterless plasmid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). We found that the human ACE2 cDNA, when encoded behind a consensus Kozak sequence permitting frequent ribosomal translation of the mRNA, yielded high ACE2 cell surface abundance, roughly 10-fold greater than ACE2 protein observed in Vero-E6 cells, commonly used to propagate SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P7">We previously discovered that our pseudovirus infection system was more sensitive than traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays utilizing soluble proteins. For example, expression of ACE2 mutants K31D or K353D, which reduced binding to soluble monomeric SARS-CoV RBD <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], had little to no effect for SARS-CoV spike pseudovirus infection when translated from a consensus Kozak sequence in our expression platform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Instead, we only observed reduced pseudovirus infection when the K31D or K353D ACE2 mutant protein levels were reduced 30-fold, suggesting that avidity effects conferred by high cell-surface ACE2 abundances can compensate for reductions to binding affinity. Thus, we focused on further developing a flexible pseudovirus infection assay capable of detecting weak but specific protein interactions enabling infection.</p>
            <p id="P8">To increase throughput, we converted the traditional singleplex pseudovirus infection format into a duplex assay configuration. Traditionally, control and experimental cells are plated separately into different wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). All wells are then exposed to the same volume of viral inoculum and infectivity is quantitated by taking a ratio of the amount of infection present in the experimental wells divided by the amount of infection present in the control wells. While ensemble measurements such as luciferase activity require a traditional singleplex format, fluorescent reporters for infection, such as GFP positivity, are single-cell assays and easier to multiplex. Thus, we developed an approach wherein the experimental and control cells are marked by different fluorescent proteins, allowing the two cell types to be mixed together and infected by the same inoculum of GFP-reporter pseudovirus within the same well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). Instead of calculating the ratio of GFP positivity from two different wells, we take the ratio of GFP positivity in mCherry negative control cells or putative receptor overexpressing iRFP670 positive cells, all from a single well. When testing two nearly isogenic cell lines differing solely by their expression of a putative receptor transgene, this ratio quantifies the amount of receptor-dependent enhancement to infection that has occurred.</p>
            <p id="P9">To validate this approach, we created ACE2(dEcto) negative control HEK 293T cells encoding human ACE2 lacking its entire ectodomain, and thus incapable of serving as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike. We marked these cells with red nuclei using mCherry-fused histone H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Notably, HEK 293T cells naturally express a low but detectable amount of endogenous ACE2 from the X chromosome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], thus accounting for the low, background level of infection in the assay. We next created ACE2 HEK 293T cells encoding full-length human ACE2 and marked these cells with near-infrared fluorescent nuclei using iRFP670-fused histone H2A. These cells exhibit more than 100-fold increased ACE2 protein than unmodified HEK 293T cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. These cells were mixed into the same well and exposed to GFP encoding lentiviral particles coated with the ACE2-dependent envelope glycoprotein SARS-CoV spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <bold>left</bold>), or an ACE2-independent envelope glycoprotein such as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <bold>right</bold>), which uses LDLR as the viral entry receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. After two or more days, the entire well of cells can be analyzed with multi-color flow cytometry to simultaneously measure the infection rates in ACE2-expressing or control cells. We observed that ACE2-dependent viruses, such as those with SARS-CoV spike, exhibited preferential infection of the ACE2 expressing, iRFP670 fluorescent cells, whereas pseudoviruses coated with VSV-G infected the mCherry and iRFP670 expressing cells equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). We will heretofore refer to this as the duplex infection assay.</p>
            <p id="P10">We next performed a systematic analysis of how the duplex infection assay performed when the two cells were mixed at different ratios and compared these results with data obtained using the traditional singleplex assay format. We observed the greatest ACE2-dependent infection when the ACE2-expressing cells were a tenth of the total cells in the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>), with the coefficient of variation similar to the traditional singleplex assay format. As the proportion of ACE2-expressing cells increased, the amount of ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated infection reduced from ~ 52-fold at 10% ACE2-expressing cells to ~ 16-fold at 40% ACE2-expressing cells. There was a concomitant increase in the coefficient of variation suggesting a loss of data precision, at least partially due to insufficient sampling of the background level of infection in the control cells. Thus, when the receptor-expressing cells were infrequent in the mixed pool of cells, the mixed-cell infection assay was capable of producing data of comparable magnitude and precision to the traditional singleplex assay format, while reducing the number of total samples and requiring fewer physical manipulations. Due to these largely favorable characteristics, we used the duplex infection assay for all subsequent experiments.</p>

            <title>Known and proposed receptors for SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated infection</title>
            <p id="P11">While ACE2 is the primary SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor, numerous other proteins have been suggested to serve as alternative receptors. <italic>BSG</italic> encodes CD147 / Basigin, which was proposed to be a novel host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], though this has since been refuted[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. <italic>CLEC4M</italic> encodes L-SIGN / CD209L, which along with the related DCSIGN / CD209, was proposed to be a receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and glycomimetic antagonists can block this interaction and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Lectins are generally regarded as attachment factors rather than <italic>bona fide</italic> receptors as they have been implicated in enhancing entry for over 30 different viral glycoproteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. <italic>NRP1</italic> and <italic>NRP2</italic> encode Neuropilin-1 / NRP1 and Neuropilin-2 / NRP2, which were proposed to be receptors since they bind peptides formed upon furin cleavage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], and the SARS-CoV-2 spike has a furin cleavage site that is important for its transmission[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], while SARS-CoV spike does not.</p>
            <p id="P12">We used our duplex infection assay platform to compare the functional impacts of these proposed alternative receptors with ACE2 during SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus infection. We created plasmid constructs encoding both untagged and cytoplasmically HA-tagged cDNAs of each proposed receptor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), and genomically integrated these DNAs alongside an IRES-iRFP670-H2A cassette into HEK 293T cells. Cells encoding the HA-tagged versions were immunoblotted to confirm the expression of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). The predominant bands in the ACE2, CD147, and L-SIGN lysates corresponded to the electrophoretic migration sizes of the full-length, glycosylated proteins. In contrast to these three proteins, the bands corresponding to NRP1 and NRP2 were less abundant, although bands consistent with full-length protein were seen upon longer exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, <bold>top</bold>). Thus, all five proteins were expressed from their corresponding cDNAs, albeit to varying steady-state abundances.</p>
            <p id="P13">We next determined how the presence of each protein enhanced SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pseudovirus infection of cells expressing the HA-tagged or untagged forms of the protein were nearly identical (Pearson’s r<sup>2</sup>: 0.98, n = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, to improve statistical power for weak effect sizes, we merged the two datasets. Consistent with the known importance of ACE2, its expression increased infection with SARS-CoV 10-fold and SARS-CoV-2 spike 12-fold, while pseudoviruses with VSV-G were unaffected. L-SIGN increased SARS-CoV-2 spike infection 2.8-fold, while it had a more modest 1.7-fold effect on SARS-CoV spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). The next strongest effect was a 1.5-fold increase to SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated infection conferred by NRP2, though it similarly simulated infection by VSV-G, which is not processed by furin. Thus, our assay revealed that ectopic ACE2 expression conferred the strongest increase to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated pseudovirus infection while L-SIGN conferred a milder but still significant increase.</p>

            <title>The BtKY72 RBD confers human ACE2-dependent infection</title>
            <p id="P14">Following the initial SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002, there were extensive efforts to identify the bat viruses that were its precursor. This resulted in the isolation of WIV1, a bat virus highly related to SARS-CoV capable of using human ACE2 for entry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Similar surveillance efforts uncovered hundreds of related coronaviruses in bats, but many of the receptor usages of these viruses are unknown. Due to the increased sensitivity possible with pseudovirus assays[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], we focused our remaining studies toward assessing the ACE2 dependencies of diverse, uncharacterized SARS-like CoV spike proteins.</p>
            <p id="P15">To further establish the specificity of the approach, we subjected the mixture of cells expressing either the human ACE2 cDNA or the ectodomain-deleted control ACE2 construct to a panel of viruses pseudotyped with a wide range of viral entry glycoproteins. We found that the glycoproteins for Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Lassa fever virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Junin virus, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infected both ACE2 expressing and ACE2 null cells similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), consistent with the fact that none of these glycoproteins rely on ACE2 for infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In contrast, the spike protein from WIV1 exhibited clear human ACE2-dependence comparable to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Thus, the ACE2 duplex pseudovirus infection assay can be used to query the dependencies of a wide range of viral glycoproteins with high specificity.</p>
            <p id="P16">We next turned our attention to characterizing the RBDs from the spike proteins of novel sarbecoviruses observed in bats. The RBDs from the spike proteins of sequenced sarbecoviruses thus far divide into three major clades[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], although more are likely to be found and divided into additional clades[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. All RBDs from clade 1 viruses tested so far have used ACE2 for entry, oftentimes exhibiting clear binding and utilization of human ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], while the receptor dependencies of clade 2 and clade 3 viruses are unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We compiled a list of clade 2 and clade 3 RBDs following manual curation of sarbecovirus spike proteins currently listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Clade 3 RBDs were all roughly 219 to 222 residues in length, and thus similar in length to clade 1 RBDs which were between 222 and 223 residues. In contrast, clade 2 RBDs possess an internal deletion, resulting in RBDs of 204 or 205 residues in length. To contextualize the protein sequence differences between diverse sarbecovirus RBDs, we created a matrix of pairwise Hamming distances of the differences in amino acid sequence for each RBD, ordered by hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 1</xref>). The resulting clustering recreated the three established clades[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and largely corresponded to evolutionary phylogenies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P17">Clade 1 and clade 3 virus RBDs exhibited similarities not shared with clade 2 RBDs. Clade 1 and clade 3 RBD sequences were more similar to each other than clade 2 RBDs, while clade 2 RBDs were equally distant from both of the other clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B and 3C</xref>). Clade 1 RBDs also exhibited high intra-clade variability, such as between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, which exhibit 60 amino acid differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Similar to clade 1 RBDs, the clade 3 RBDs exhibited high intra-clade variability, with many pairwise combinations differing by 40 or more amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B and 3C</xref>). In contrast, the RBDs from clade 2 viruses yielded comparatively low intra-clade variability, with the RBDs exhibiting 28 amino acid differences or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 1</xref>). In a previous study, none of the twenty one clade 2 RBDs tested used human ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Only three clade 3 RBDs (BM48-31, PRD-0038, and PDF-2386) were tested, with none exhibiting increased infection with human ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In contrast, RaTG15, which possesses an RBD distinct from the other known sarbecoviruses and thus may constitute a separate clade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], and the clade 1 viruses, have all been shown to use ACE2, either from humans or from other animals.</p>
            <p id="P18">The dissimilarity of the clade 2 RBD sequences relative to the other clades likely results in an altered tertiary structure in the RBD surface typically known to bind ACE2. Homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the YN2013 clade 2 RBD showed the ~15 residue deletion to cause a shortening of the receptor binding motif in a section often referred to as the “receptor binding ridge”[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>), a disulfide-linked loop that makes contact with the N-terminal alpha helix in the ACE2 protein ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). This deletion removes the disulfide bond, as none of the clade 2 RBDs encode cysteines in that region (RBD residues 158 through 171), while all clade 1 or clade 3 viruses do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). Accordingly, there are only seven cysteines encoded in clade 2 RBDs, while the clade 1 and clade 3 viruses have nine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, homology models of the BtKY72 clade 3 and SARS-CoV-2 clade 1 RBDs showed an extended receptor binding ridge similar to the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 cryo-EM co-structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P19">Coronavirus spike proteins are routinely greater than 1250 amino acids in length, and chemically synthesizing each cDNA for functional analysis is prohibitively expensive. We instead took a chimeric spike approach, where we chemically synthesized the RBDs from various bat coronaviruses, and inserted the sequence in place of the RBD of SARS-CoV spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We tested a panel of three clade 2 RBDs: Rs4237[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], Rp3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], and YN2013[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], each found in horseshoe bats in Eastern or Southeastern Asia. We also initially tested a small panel of clade 3 RBDs: BM48-31[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], BB9904, and BtKY72[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], which were the only three clade 3 RBDs identified as of June 2020. BM48-31 and BB9904 were identified from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>blasii</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>euryale</italic> bat samples collected in Bulgaria, while BtKY72 was collected from an unidentified <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat in Kenya. As positive controls, we generated chimeric SARS-CoV spikes encoding the WIV1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. The WIV1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs promoted strong ACE2 -dependent pseudovirus entry, corresponding to 81-fold and 63-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3H</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). Of the clade 2 and clade 3 RBDs, only BtKY72 exhibited significant human ACE2-dependent entry, corresponding to a ~ 5-fold increase.</p>
            <p id="P20">To validate our result with BtKY72, we explored this interaction in additional contexts. We first assessed whether we could enhance ACE2-dependent entry by co-expressing the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which promotes spike-mediated viral entry at the cell surface[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], bypassing the need for endocytosis and proteolysis by endosomal cathepsins for activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The BtKY72 chimeric virus exhibited slightly increased infection in the presence of TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 2A</xref>). Furthermore, upon alignment of the BtKY72 RBD with the SARS-CoV, WIV1, and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, we found a number of highly conserved positions at the purported ACE2 interface, including BtKY72 residues Y488 and T499 (corresponding to Y489 and T500 in SARS-CoV-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). To test whether these residues were involved in BtKY72 RBD interaction with human ACE2, we created Y488H or T499E mutant BtKY72 RBD chimeric spike pseudoviruses. Both single amino acid mutations abrogated ACE2-dependent entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3H</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). While our observation of human ACE2 dependence with the BtKY72 RBD chimeric SARS-CoV spike should be reflective of what happens with the full-length BtKY72 spike, this needs to be formally shown. We attempted to recreate the full BtKY72 spike by piece-wise addition of additional BtKY72 spike sequence into the BtKY72 RBD chimeric spike, but were unable to observe ACE2 dependent entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 2B</xref>), as additional sequence swap points resulted in largely non-functional protein.</p>

            <title>Multiple clade 3 sarbecoviruses use human and rhinolophid ACE2</title>
            <p id="P21">Having observed human ACE2 utilization by the RBD from BtKY72, we undertook a more comprehensive experiment testing combinations of diverse RBDs with various horseshoe bat or human ACE2 proteins. During our previous experiments, six more clade 3 RBDs were identified. Three were identified through the USAID-PREDICT project, corresponding to PRD-0038, PDF-2370, and PDF-2386. Like BtKY72, these sequences were discovered in African bats of unknown species within the <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> genus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The RBDs from PDF-2370 and PDF-2386 were identical, and all three RBDs clustered closely with BtKY72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>), so we did not incorporate them into our study. In contrast, three highly unique RBDs were also discovered through ecological sequencing efforts; Khosta-1 and Khosta-2, observed in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>hipposideros</italic> bats in Sochi Russia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and RhGB01 observed in a <italic>R</italic>. <italic>hipposideros</italic> bat in the United Kingdom[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. We thus created SARS-CoV chimeric spikes encoding these RBDs.</p>
            <p id="P22">Based on our aforementioned result with BtKY72, we suspected that more clade 3 sarbecovirus RBDs are ACE2-dependent, but may only be compatible with ACE2 sequences encoded by their natural hosts, prompting us to synthesize additional ACE2 orthologs from <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats. ACE2 is known to be positively selected in bats, particularly at residues at the interface with SARS-CoV spike[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. ACE2 is also highly polymorphic in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic> bats[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Due to these variations, different horseshoe bat ACE2 sequences likely exhibit a range of compatibility with diverse RBD sequences. There are more than 106 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> species known[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The majority of the variation between rhinolophid ACE2 sequences are found in the ACE2 ectodomain, including positions 24, 27, 31, and 34, which exhibited 4 or more different amino acids at each site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). These highly variable positions are along the face of an alpha helix in contact with SARS-like CoV RBDs including their receptor binding ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>), and were previously shown to be positively selected[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P23">To quantitate the differences between the ACE2 sequences, we created another Hamming distance matrix comparing each pair of rhinolophid ACE2 protein sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3</xref>). We then chose 6 orthologs, including 3 distantly related alleles from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic>, for experimental characterization. We synthesized codon-optimized cDNA sequence encoding the first 600 ACE2 residues, corresponding to the majority of the ectodomain of each <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2, as this region should contain all of the sequence impacting RBD binding and viral entry. To minimize effort and cost, we ligated these sequences to a DNA sequence encoding the last 200 residues of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> ACE2, including its transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). A distance matrix for our tested constructs showed that the rhinolophid ACE2 sequences differed by a minimum of 7 residues and a maximum of 56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Each chimeric ACE2 allele was stably recombined into HEK 293T landing pad cells, and expression was confirmed by immunoblot against the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> cytoplasmic domain, shared by all of our chimeric rhinolophid ACE2 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). All constructs yielded ACE2 proteins at roughly the expected size, with slight differences in electrophoretic mobility among samples, potentially due to differing numbers of N-glycosylation motifs. Instead of a doublet like the rest of the samples, the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus (472)</italic> allele yielded a single band in some immunoblot experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>), although it also yielded a doublet in other replicate immunoblots.</p>
            <p id="P24">We performed the duplex pseudotyped virus infection assay as a matrix of combinations of chimeric RBD pseudotyped viruses and cells expressing human or <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 proteins. The fraction of control mCherry+ or ACE2-expressing miRFP670+ cells were quantitated using flow cytometry and averaged across the replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). In the process of performing these experiments, we observed massive syncytia formation in a subset of samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 4</xref>), including some syncytia that reached half a millimeter in width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Since large syncytia are unlikely to be efficiently measured alongside normal sized cells in the flow cytometer, we also quantified the frequency of green fluorescence in mCherry+ or miRFP670+ cells using fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 5</xref>). Despite the reduced dynamic range of the microscopy assay, the results between the two measurements were largely consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 6</xref>), providing additional confidence in the results. Regardless of the readout, the controls also performed as expected, wherein VSV-G coated pseudoviruses did not exhibit ACE2-dependent infection and miRFP670+ cells expressing a null ACE2 cDNA harboring an early frameshift mutation did not enhance spike-mediated pseudovirus infection above that of mCherry+ ACE2(dEcto) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P25">The clade 1 RBDs showed broad utilization of ACE2 alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A, 5C and 5D</xref>), typified by WIV1, which was clearly enhanced by all but two orthologs tested. This included strong enhancement by <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus(215)</italic>, consistent with the fact that WIV1 was isolated from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic> bats of currently unknown allelic genotype. Also in agreement with previous reports, neither SARS-CoV nor SARS-CoV-2 RBDs utilized ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> or <italic>R</italic>. <italic>pearsonii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], while both utilized ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>affinis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. SARS-CoV RBD exhibited compatibility with ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic>, much like WIV1, consistent with this likely being similar to its initial source of zoonosis. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited low compatibility with the tested <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic> alleles, but did exhibit strong compatibility with ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>affinis</italic>. This is consistent with RaTG13, isolated from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>affinis</italic> bats, possessing one of the most similar RBD sequences to SARS-CoV-2 to date[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P26">In contrast, clade 2 RBDs did not exhibit obvious signals of ACE2-dependent entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Only the Rs4237 RBD paired with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>landeri</italic> ACE2 yielded signal in both the flow cytometry and microscopy readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A and 5C</xref>), although this effect was relatively minor.

Regardless, the lack of strong compatibility between the tested clade 2 RBDs and any of the <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 alleles we tested suggest that these viruses use a different cell surface protein as a primary receptor and at best, only use ACE2 in an auxiliary role.</p>
            <p id="P27">Clade 3 RBDs exhibited several distinct patterns of ACE2 ortholog usage. Along with BtKY72, the Khosta-2 RBD exhibited clearly enhanced entry in the presence of human ACE2. These two RBDs differed by 46 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>), corresponding to ~ 80% amino acid identity, suggesting that they may be using a different set of amino acid side chain interactions to engage the ACE2 protein surface. Accordingly, their usage patterns of the tested <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> alleles were vastly different. Khosta-2 could only utilize ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alycone</italic>, while BtKY72 exhibited the broadest utilization of ACE2 alleles in the panel.

            <p id="P28">Despite the various clade 3 sarbecovirus spike RBD and <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 ortholog compatibilities observed in our pseudovirus infection assay, an important practical consideration is whether the virus is likely to encounter the corresponding bat in real life. For example, RhGB01, BB9904, and Khosta-2 were isolated from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>hipposideros</italic> or <italic>R</italic>. <italic>euryale</italic> bats in Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <bold>bottom</bold>). Neither of these bats have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa, and thus unlikely to allow transmission of these viruses to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic> bats despite their potential RBD-ACE2 molecular compatibility. In contrast, BM48-31 was found in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>blasii</italic> bats, which have been observed in Eastern and Southern Africa, and thus in closer proximity to the known range of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic> bats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>, <bold>top</bold>). Thus, while all four RBDs can use the ACE2 from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic>, only BM48-31 was found within a host bat of potentially overlapping geographical range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>, <bold>bottom</bold>), and more likely to allow infection in those bats in real life.</p>
            <p id="P29">Unlike the viruses isolated in Europe, BtKY72 and the related PDF-2370, PDF-2386, and PRD-0038 viruses were observed in <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats in Central and East Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). The exact species was not determined upon collection, although sequencing of the ACE2 gene from the PDF-2370 sample revealed that the host bat was likely <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> or a highly related species, only differing by 4 to 10 amino acids depending on the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> ACE2 allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3</xref>). <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> bats are not thought to populate Africa, although the host bat ACE2 sequenced from the PDF-2370 sample would suggest that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>, or a highly related bat, is present in Central Africa. The next most similar of the currently sequenced ACE2 orthologs belonged to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>landeri</italic>, differing by 25 and 28 residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3</xref>).

            <p id="P30">We also looked for ACE2 sequence patterns consistent with a history of sarbecovirus infection in these African horseshoe bats.

            <title>ACE2 lysine 31 impacts a subset of clade 3 RBD infections</title>
            <p id="P31">Better understanding of the ways in which diverse sarbecoviruses have achieved compatibility with human ACE2 may help identify molecular barriers initially posed by ACE2 sequence differences that can be circumvented through RBD sequence adaptations from prior infection in various hosts. Within our set, the four RBDs capable of binding human ACE2 exhibited different patterns in <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 ortholog usage. While they all recognize the same overall binding site on ACE2, they are likely presenting unique interfaces for the interaction, and thus relying on a different set of side chains within the same human ACE2 protein sequence. Our panel of <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 orthologs differ at many residues, so it is impossible to delineate which specific amino acids are playing the most important roles in each interaction.</p>
            <p id="P32">To gain amino-acid level resolution into this interaction, we tested a panel of human ACE2 mutants. We originally tested constructs that yield low amounts of overall ACE2 protein, as we previously saw that high ACE2 levels can mask the impacts of human ACE2 mutants during SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 entry. These RBDs use the human ACE2 protein surface differently, as human ACE2 mutants Y41A and E37K reduced SARS-CoV spike-mediated entry without impacting SARS-CoV-2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. We repeated the original singleplex experiments with the duplex infection assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7A</xref>) and saw a strong correlation between the two assay results (Pearson’s r: 0.95, n = 30; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7B</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P33">Testing the same panel of mutants with the BtKY72 RBD was uninformative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7A</xref>), as this interaction is likely relatively weak and requires higher ACE2 amounts to promote infection. We thus recreated a smaller set of human ACE2 mutants in our high abundance ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression construct, recombined them into HEK 293T landing pad cells, and exposed the cells to pseudoviruses with these RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>). Both flow cytometry and microscopy readouts correlated well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7E</xref>). Most mutants had little impact on pseudovirus infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs in this context, except for D355N and R357T, which measurably reduced infection by all three clade 1 RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with previous results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P34">The clade 3 sarbecoviruses had distinct reliances on human ACE2 mutants, typified by differences in how they were impacted by the K31D mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). Infection by both clade 3 RBDs were hampered by the D355N and R357T mutants, showing that these contacts serve a common role across diverse RBD interfaces. The Khosta-2 RBD was unaffected by the Y41A and K353D mutants, but particularly reliant on K31, as the K31D mutant reduced infection as strongly as D355N and R357T. In contrast, BtKY72 was strongly inhibited by most of the human ACE2 mutants tested including Y41A and K353D, with the sole exception being K31D, which drastically enhanced pseudovirus infection with the BtKY72 RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P35">Despite the known signatures of evolutionary positive selection driving variation at ACE2 position 31 within bats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], it is unclear which types of RBDs may be involved in this coevolutionary interplay. Clade 1 sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are inhibited by the K31D mutant when ACE2 abundance is limiting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 7A</xref>), suggesting that they either favor a Lys at this site or disfavor an Asp. Multiple co-structures show that SARS-CoV-2 spike Q493 can form a hydrogen bond with K31 in human or pangolin ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 8</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], although this was not observed in all structures.</p>
            <p id="P36">To gain better insight at this molecular interaction, we aligned the homology models for BtKY72, Khosta-1, and Khosta-2 with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. As the SARS-CoV-2 Q493 position is at the end of a highly conserved beta-strand within the receptor binding motif, the models predicted the different amino acid side-chains at this position to extend from the same site and overall direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). WIV1 and Khosta-2, which are both inhibited by the K31D human ACE2 mutant, encode either a Asn or Gln at this position and thus may also form similar hydrogen bonds as observed with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). BtKY72, which prefers the K31D human ACE2 mutant, encodes a Lys at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). This Lys side chain would lack the ability to hydrogen bond with K31 and their like charges may make close contacts energetically unfavorable.</p>
            <p id="P37">We hypothesized that the pairwise identities of ACE2 residue 31 and the nearby residue on the RBD may determine compatibility for a subset of interactions. We tested this observation by looking at the ACE2 ortholog compatibility for BtKY72 and Khosta-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). Both of these viruses could not enter cells expressing Rhinolophid ACE2 orthologs encoding Lys at this position, while they could enter orthologs encoding Asp, Glu, or Asn. Khosta-1 was incapable of using human ACE2, which also encodes Lys at this position. The BtKY72 RBD could use human ACE2 thus defying this pattern, although its enhancement with the K31D mutant of human ACE2 supports our overall hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). The only other RBD with a Lys at this position was from BB9904. While this RBD was unable to support entry into cells expressing the K31 ACE2 orthologs from humans, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus(472)</italic> bats and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>pearsonii</italic> bats, this RBD also could not enter cells with other orthologs, and was less conclusive.</p>
            <p id="P38">Altogether, our studies show that currently known sarbecoviruses have segregated into two groups of RBDs based on their ACE2-dependence or independence, with the more diverse ACE2-dependent viruses further segregating into sequence subgroups that each differentially utilize host ACE2 protein sequences during viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). The sequences within the ACE2-dependent RBDs can be highly divergent, but a constellation of pairwise interactions, such as those between ACE2 position 31 and the adjacent RBD residue often encoding Gln, Asn, Lys, or Ala, likely determine the patterns of ortholog-specific compatibilities that enable successful entry during potential zoonotic events.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p id="P39">Here, we created a duplex pseudovirus infection assay for interrogating protein sequences capable of promoting viral infection. We subsequently harnessed this assay to test a matrix of 108 pairwise combinations for pseudovirus infection, with 12 different spike RBD sequences and 9 different ACE2 orthologs, to demonstrate that clade 3 sarbecoviruses consistently use various subsets of ACE2 alleles from a panel of horseshoe bats, with at least two clade 3 sarbecovirus spike RBDs also capable of using human ACE2. Our results also provide context for the importance of ACE2 residue 31, known to exhibit strong signatures of positive selection across bat species.</p>
         <p id="P40">Our work was aided by the internally controlled, duplex nature of the infection assay format. This assay format recapitulated the effect size of the traditional singleplex format when the highly infectable cells were a minor fraction of the overall mixed cell population, and the magnitude of the effect was reduced by one-third when the cells were mixed equally. Testing the control and experimental samples in the same well allowed us to reduce the total number of samples in each experiment by up to two-fold. Notably, <italic>in vivo</italic> infections involve complex cell mixtures, and while the duplex infection assay does not fully recreate such conditions, it may be an improved proxy over traditional singleplex measurements for obtaining infection measurements. Future advancements with multiplexed assessments of receptor sequences in pseudovirus infection assays will likely come through uniquely barcoding each transgenic construct, so that cells that are sensitive or resistant to infection can be sorted and subsequently counted using high-throughput sequencing.</p>
         <p id="P41">Viral glycoproteins that facilitate entry at the cell surface can cause cell-cell fusion resulting in syncytia formation. Consistent with other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], we saw rampant syncytia formation with many of the WT or chimeric sarbecovirus spike proteins we tested, particularly when ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were both overexpressed. This observation prompted us to develop an automated microscopy readout for the duplex infection assay, as this does not require disrupting syncytia prior to measurement. While the dynamic range of our microscopy readout was smaller than the flow cytometry assay, the overall patterns were highly correlated between measurement types across all experiments. Our fluorescent nuclei markers aided the image-based analysis pipeline, as nuclei are far more consistent in size and shape than the cell bodies of adherent cells.</p>
         <p id="P42">Despite the additional proteins proposed to serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our side-by-side comparison showed ACE2 to confer the vast majority of enhancement to infection, followed by L-SIGN. While we did not test DCSIGN or SIGLEC1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], these factors will likely confer similar effects as L-SIGN as they likely share a common mechanism for enhancing viral attachment to target cells through glycan binding. We did not see enhanced entry from overexpression of CD147, NRP1, or NRP2. Multiple recent studies have also observed no effect through CD147 overexpression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], casting major doubt on its importance during SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. Similar to our work, another study also did not observe significant effects from NRP1 or NRP2 overexpression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], so the roles of these proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear.</p>
         <p id="P43">Our sequence-function analysis revealed clear protein sequence and feature differences separating the ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent groups. The ACE2-independent group completely overlaps with the evolutionary defined clade 2 sarbecoviruses. These RBDs are highly related to each other, but clearly distinct from the ACE2-dependent RBDs in amino acid length and sequence identity. In contrast to the structurally resolved clade 1 RBDs, including those from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2-independent RBDs are ~ 15 residues shorter and are predicted to lack the disulfide bridged receptor binding ridge, particularly as the majority of ACE2-independent RBDs do not encode cysteines in this region of the interface. None of these RBDs conferred ACE2-dependent infection, even with sequences derived from bats of the same species as the ones they were isolated from.</p>
         <p id="P44">In contrast, the ACE2-dependent RBDs included all known clade 1 and clade 3 viruses, and the viruses within the recently discovered RaTG15 clade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. These RBDs were between 219 and 223 residues in length, possessed a pair of cysteines in the receptor binding ridge capable of forming a disulfide bridge, and exhibited species-specific utilization of at least one known rhinolophid ACE2 protein. Despite their shared feature of ACE2 utilization, these RBDs can still drastically vary in protein sequence, with diverse pairs of RBDs exhibiting amino acid differences at 50 to 75 positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 1</xref>). While all known clade 1 and clade 3 sarbecovirus RBDs share these features, there are undoubtedly additional clades of sarbecovirus RBDs not yet observed which may defy these patterns.</p>
         <p id="P45">Two other preprints have recently observed similar findings with clade 3 sarbecovirus RBD utilization of ACE2. Starr and colleagues observed weak <italic>in vitro</italic> binding between BtKY72 RBD and human ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], which could be enhanced with a K493Y/T498W double mutant in the RBD that increases its affinity. They, too, were initially unable to observe pseudovirus infection with the full length WT BtKY72 spike, although the double mutant spike yielded detectable infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Seifert and Letko observed that the Khosta-2 RBD could use human ACE2 during infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Both of these observations are consistent with our results, considering slight differences in assay sensitivities. By generating a larger set of rhinolophid ACE2 orthologs including <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic>, and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>landeri</italic>, we were also able to test sequences that were likely more similar to those in the bats that serve as their natural hosts, instrumental in seeing that all of the known sarbecoviruses with RBDs possessing 219 or more residues are ACE2-dependent. The precise genetic determinants of compatibility between spike RBD and host ACE2 sequences will become clearer once more <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 sequences are sequenced and tested in functional assays like ours.</p>
         <p id="P46">Despite the overall concordance in results from independent groups, some inconsistencies remain. For example, a previous study by Wells and colleagues concluded that the PRD-0038 and PDF-2370 / PDF-2386 RBDs, which they refer to as “Rwanda” and “Uganda” viruses, do not utilize human ACE2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. These RBDs are highly similar to the clear human ACE2-compatible BtKY72 RBD, differing only in 3 or 4 amino acids across the ~ 222 residue RBD. It is currently unclear whether this discrepancy is due to a difference in assay sensitivity, or whether the relatively small number of amino acid differences between these highly related RBDs were capable of drastically altering their affinity for human ACE2.</p>
         <p id="P47">Even with the advantages of our assay and results, interpretations should be made with caution. Due to financial constraints, the diverse sarbecovirus spikes and <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> ACE2 alleles we tested were chimeric molecules, wherein the domains most critical for the virus-host interaction were swapped into existing scaffold protein sequences. As some chimeric molecules may not be fully stable, there are the possibilities of false negatives in our dataset. For example, the strongest enhancement to pseudovirus infection conferred by <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic> (472) ACE2 cells was the 3.5-fold increase with WIV1 chimeric spike, and it is currently unclear whether this relatively poor enhancement is a true property of this allele, or an artifact of altered protein conformation or subcellular localization.</p>
         <p id="P48">While BtKY72 and Khosta-2 RBDs can utilize human ACE2 during entry, this does not mean that these viruses are currently capable of infecting humans. In both cases, the amounts of pseudovirus infection conferred by these RBDs were less than those conferred by the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV1 RBDs. These interactions may still be too inefficient to allow wide-spread entry and replication within humans.</p>
         <p id="P49">Furthermore, replication <italic>in vivo</italic> is multifactorial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], and there are likely additional incompatibilities in immune antagonism and replication that may stifle a zoonotic event. For example, the Khosta viruses lack genes thought to antagonize the immune system, such as ORF8[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. While not sufficient, compatible interactions between viral entry proteins and host receptor proteins are likely necessary for zoonosis. Thus, these results demonstrate that there are sarbecoviruses that are at least partially primed to jump into humans, and that surveillance efforts should be further extended outside of East Asia to other continents, including Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>
         <p id="P50">The drastic differences in ACE2 and sarbecovirus RBD compatibility observed in our study highlight the importance of knowing the genotypes of both the virus and host. For example, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>alcyone</italic> was compatible with all clade 1 and 3 RBDs tested, while the highly related ortholog from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>landeri</italic> was only compatible with half of these viruses, and the next related sequence from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> was only compatible with BtKY72 and Khosta-1. All three species may overlap in geographical range in Central Africa, and accurate identification of the host bat is needed to know which species can serve as reservoirs <italic>in vivo</italic>. There is a staggering amount of ACE2 allelic variation in horseshoe bats, including the 19 or more variants observed with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sinicus</italic>, the 6 or more variants observed with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>affinis</italic>, and 3 or more variants observed with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>. With some pairs of alleles in the same species differing by as much as 17 residues, there are likely drastically different viral susceptibilities and phenotypic heterogeneity within a population of the same species. Future efforts capable of simultaneously sequencing both the viral genome and host ACE2 coding sequence from a single sample will undoubtedly help uncover some of these complex relationships between virus and host.</p>
         <p id="P51">Our results clarify the molecular interactions that likely underlie the evolutionary interplays between sarbecovirus RBDs and host ACE2 sequences. For example, ACE2 residue 31 was long known to be a site of evolutionary conflict due to its signature of positive selection in bats[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. We found that the BtKY72 and Khosta-1 RBDs disfavor horseshoe bat ACE2 orthologs and alleles encoding K31. Human ACE2 also encodes K31. While BtKY72 was capable of using human ACE2, its infection was enhanced with K31D mutant human ACE2. Both RBDs encode Lys at the RBD residue that interacts with ACE2 position 31, suggesting a potential side-chain incompatibility making the interaction less energetically favorable.</p>
         <p id="P52">Consistent with our interpretation, Starr and colleagues found that the WT BtKY72 Lys residue was disfavored for human ACE2 interaction, as substitution to multiple other amino acids including Tyr, Gln, Phe, Ala, Val, Gly, and Cys improved binding[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. In contrast, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs encode Asn or Gln at the analogous residue, and disfavor the K31D mutant of human ACE2. Thus, an amino acid that is favored for one sarbecovirus RBD is disfavored for the other, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. A similar pattern of incompatibility was previously observed between N479 of SARS-CoV RBD or K479 from a related virus cSz02 from palm civets, and K31 of human or T31 of palm civet ACE2, thought to be important for transmission of SARS-CoV from palm civet intermediate hosts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Similar interplays likely exist between other key pairs of RBDs and ACE2 residues, and the collective actions of all of these interactions likely dictate ACE2 usage by a given RBD.</p>
         <p id="P53">The current pandemic is a sobering reminder of the importance of understanding the molecular barriers that normally prevent zoonosis, especially when previous ecological and societal factors that also served as barriers continue to erode. Once identified, weakened barriers can be bolstered or surveilled as part of pandemic precaution. While most prescient with sarbecoviruses, these considerations apply to other viruses, including Merbecoviruses, Henipaviruses, or Filoviruses. Multiplexable genetic assays will be instrumental in getting the large number of data points needed to understand the nuanced molecular coevolutionary relationships that exist across a diverse set of host-pathogen interactions.</p>

To create the chimeric rhinolophid ACE2 molecules, 100 ng of eBlock DNA oligomers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used as the template.

EGFP was excited with a 488 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 530/30 nm bandpass filter. mCherry was excited with a 561 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 620/15 nm bandpass filter. iRFP670 and miRFP670 were excited with a 638 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 720/30 nm bandpass filter. For the BD LSRII, mTagBFP2 was excited with a 405 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 440/40 nm bandpass filter. EGFP was excited with a 488 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a B525/50 nm bandpass filter. mCherry was excited with a 561 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 610/20 nm bandpass filter. iRFP670 and miRFP670 were excited with a 640 nm laser, and emitted light was collected after passing through a 710/40 nm bandpass filter. Before analysis of fluorescence, live, single cells were gated using FSC-A and SSC-A (for live cells) and FSC-A and FSC-H (for single cells).</p>
            <p id="P67">Fluorescent images were captured on a Nikon Ti-2E fluorescent microscope, outfitted with a SOLA SM II 365 light engine (Lumencor), a CFI Plan Apochromat DM Lambda 20X objective or a NIKON Plan Fluor 4X objective, GFP (#96392), Texas Red (#96395), or Cy5 (#96396) filter sets, and imaged with a DS-QI2 monochrome CMOS camera. The images were captured with an automated image acquisition workflow, which performed autofocus on each well of a 96-well plate. All exposure times for each fluorescent channel were kept constant between wells and replicate experiments. The captured TIFF files were analyzed with a custom Python script utilizing the numpy, scipy, cv2, skimage, and PIL packages. This script entitled “Overlap_ratio_calculation.py” can be found in the project GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MatreyekLab/ACE2_dependence">https://github.com/MatreyekLab/ACE2_dependence</ext-link>). The image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref> was processed in NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon), with intensity minimums and maximums auto scaled to show the locations and relative sizes of the red or near-infrared nuclei, and highlight the distribution of GFP within the large syncytial cell.</p>

            <p id="P68">Data analysis was performed using version 1.4.1717 of RStudio, with the exception of flow cytometry data, which was first analyzed using version 10.8.0 of FlowJo. An R Markdown file containing code capable of fully reproducing the analyses can be found at the Matreyek Lab GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MatreyekLab/ACE2_dependence">https://github.com/MatreyekLab/ACE2_dependence</ext-link>). The analysis utilized the tidyverse[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], ggrepel, ggbeeswarm, sf[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], and ggfortify[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] packages. Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-tests, and multiple test corrections were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The principal component analysis was performed by using the cmdscale classical (metric) multidimensional scaling function in ggfortify on the RBD Hamming distance matrix shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 1</xref>.</p>
            <p id="P69">To calculate ACE2 dependent infection by flow cytometry, the acquired single cells were subsequently gated into mCherry+/iRFP670- or mCherry-/iRFP670+ sub-populations using FlowJo. The percentage of GFP positive cells in each subpopulation was calculated and exported as individual columns of a comma-separated value datafile. These values were copied into the experiment sample sheet listing the date, sample name, cell line used, pseudotyped virus used, and pseudotyped virus inoculum, and imported into RStudio for subsequent analysis. There the percent GFP value for the mCherry-/iRFP670+ subpopulation was divided by the percent GFP value for the mCherry+/iRFP670- population to obtain a ratio. The geometric mean of multiple replicate experiments were used to derive the ACE2-dependent infection metric used throughout our work.</p>

D) The Hamming distance matrix for sarbecovirus RBD protein sequences was used for a principal coordinate analysis. The first two principal coordinates are shown as X and Y axes, generating a scatter plot based on RBD sequence dissimilarity. Proposed delineation of ACE2-dependent and -independent RBDs based on differences in protein sequence are shown, with each clade given a different color.</p>
