DC Mtb are revealed in liquid media, their revival is often stimulated by resuscitationpromoting factors (Rpfs), secreted peptidoglycan-remodelling enzymes, and prevented by Rpf inhibitors. Here we investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in generation of Rpf-dependent DC Mtb, using murine macrophage infection models and treatment with a synthetic NO donor (NOD). Mtb subpopulations were assessed by colony-forming unit counting on agar or by limiting dilution Most Probable Number assays in liquid media with or without Rpf inhibitor. Rpf-dependent DC Mtb were detected following infection of interferon-<italic>γ</italic> induced macrophages capable of producing NO, but not when iNOS was inactivated. NOD treatment also induced transition to the Rpf-dependent DC phenotype which was accompanied by global transcriptomic changes resulting in the dramatic down-regulation of <italic>rpfA-E</italic> gene expression. Furthermore, the DC phenotype was partially reverted by artificial over-expression of Rpfs. This study elucidates molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of DC Mtb, which are the dominant population recovered from clinical tuberculosis samples, with implications for improving both tuberculosis diagnostics and treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>resuscitation-promoting factor</kwd><kwd>macrophage infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which resulted in the death of 1.6 million people in 2021.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Standard TB treatment lasts at least 6 months and significant resources are directed towards developing shorter and more effective treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> One barrier to achieving this goal is the presence of Mtb populations that are often missed by standard diagnostic tests.

Here we describe a model system for generating DC mycobacteria (both Mtb and BCG) based on a new NO donor (3-cyano-5-nitropyridin-2-yl diethyldithiocarbamate) that simulates the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment by generating heterogeneous mycobacterial populations, thereby permitting investigation of the physiologically distinct states produced during the pathogenesis of TB. Our data suggest that NOD treatment results in release of NO in living bacteria. Establishing the precise mechanism of NO release from NOD in mycobacterial cells, including any cellular factors involved, requires further investigation. Nevertheless, a low active concentration of NOD in comparison with other NO donors, and direct detection of NO in NOD-treated mycobacteria even after 24 hours of incubation, and the availability of a structurally similar control compound, makes NOD advantageous for investigation of bacterial physiology.</p><p id="P25">In our NOD-induced system, transition to the DC state was likely mediated by two alternative sigma factors, SigH and SigF and their regulons, previously implicated in adaptation to redox stress and respiration-inhibitory conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Overall, the transcriptomic signature of NOD-treated Mtb was associated with inhibition of cell division, repair of NO-induced damage, and metabolic reprogramming to restore redox balance and membrane potential. Whilst there was overlap between the transcriptional response to NOD treatment and those reported for other NO donors, there were several distinctive features associated with NOD-mediated formation of DCB, including the absence of a DosR response and the down-regulation of <italic>icl1</italic>. These changes were also observed in Mtb surviving prolonged multi-drug treatment in mice for 28 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> Remarkably, 4 out of 5 <italic>rpf</italic> genes (<italic>rpfB-E</italic>) were also downregulated in this model, while <italic>murI</italic> was up-regulated similarly to the NOD treated Mtb. We have previously shown that DC Mtb were the dominant population in mice treated with a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide for 28 days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> therefore these transcriptomic adaptations might be attributed to DC Mtb. Interestingly, the transcriptional response to NOD treatment included genes from the recently identified signature of differentially detectable (DD) Mtb from sputum samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> In particular, 5 genes, <italic>icl1, ppsA, hspX, rv1738</italic> and <italic>pks15</italic>, were significantly down-regulated in sputum Mtb DD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and NOD-treated Mtb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>icl1</italic> was down-regulated in another <italic>in vitro</italic> model for DD Mtb (the PBS-RIF model) and increased numbers of DD bacilli were formed by an <italic>icl1</italic> mutant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> Together these observations suggest that down-regulation of <italic>icl1</italic> and the glyoxylate cycle might be an important regulatory and metabolic adaptation in response to multiple stimuli for the formation of DCB both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P26">Although the deployment of stress response systems and changes in metabolic mode are likely to be important adaptations in the transition to the DC state, one of the most striking transcriptional changes observed was the down-regulation of all five <italic>rpf</italic> genes in Mtb cultures treated with NOD. Whilst there is an ongoing debate concerning the importance of NO in controlling Mtb infection in humans, even though NO is detected in TB patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> our data suggest that NO contributes to the generation of DC Mtb by down-regulation of <italic>rpfA-E</italic> expression. Rpfs are cell wall cleaving enzymes and their activities under conditions when the peptidoglycan producing machinery is likely to be damaged could be fatal for mycobacteria as a result of uncontrolled cell lysis and death. Accordingly, expression of Rpf coding genes is controlled by multiple regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and involves post-translation regulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S6</xref>); however, at this time which of these contributes to downregulation of these genes upon exposure to NO is unknown. Nevertheless, based on the evidence presented here, the simplest explanation for the observed Rpf-dependency of DC Mtb recovered from macrophages or after treatment with NOD is that exposure to NO down-regulates <italic>rpf</italic> gene expression such that mycobacteria fail to initiate Rpf production when grown in standard media. This means that emergence from the DC state requires exogenous supplementation with recombinant Rpf or Rpf-containing CSN to restart growth and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This failure to initiate <italic>rpf</italic> expression could be caused directly by the action of NO on transcriptional regulatory networks or indirectly, via metabolic reprogramming in response to NO. In addition, NO also has the potential to directly damage Rpf proteins, which require a disulfide bond for correct folding and activity. The precise mechanism of Rpf-mediated resuscitation is currently unknown, and we cannot exclude that the Rpf effect is indirect and that resuscitation involves products of peptidoglycan degradation or other unknown factors. For example, in addition to Rpf proteins, various other molecules, including cAMP, muropeptides, phospholipids, and peptides derived from Rv1174c have been proposed to resuscitate DC mycobacteria (summarized by Dartois <italic>et al</italic>.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> However, none of these additional factors have been systematically validated for resuscitation of DC mycobacteria from sputum in the way that Rpf proteins have. Indeed, CSN obtained from the quintuple <italic>rpf</italic> deletion mutant had variable resuscitation effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Moreover, there is currently no published data on the composition of CSN from the quintuple <italic>rpf</italic> deletion mutant to suggest the identities of any alternative resuscitation factors. These observations serve to highlight the complexity of Mtb resuscitation and the need for further research to uncover the roles of any Rpf-independent resuscitation factors in that process. Rpf-dependent and Rpf-independent DC Mtb may represent different subpopulations and their formation might be induced by different factors.</p><p id="P27">Overall, our findings suggest that differential culturability is a survival mechanism that allows mycobacteria to cope with prolonged host-imposed stresses, and that this has implications for the development of better TB therapies and diagnostic tools. Exposure to various levels of NO drives Mtb population heterogeneity in the infected host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These heterogeneous populations have different growth requirements, respond differently to drugs and may induce differential immune responses. Here we show that NO down-regulates the expression of all <italic>rpf</italic> genes and generates Rpf-dependent DC Mtb intracellularly in macrophages and in a new laboratory model for studying the transition to differential culturability. Thus, our work provides a foundation for further investigations to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin this fundamental adaptive process and elucidate the precise role of DC Mtb in TB pathogenesis and treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Materials and Strains</title><p id="P28">Liquid cultures were grown at 37°C with shaking (100 rpm) for Mtb and static for <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Glaxo in Middlebrook 7H9 broth, supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC), and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 (hereafter 7H9 medium).
