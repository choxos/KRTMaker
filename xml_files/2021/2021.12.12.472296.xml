The induced physical heterogeneity in the breast tissue presents a major obstacle to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Breast tumor cells (TCs) are largely responsible for desmoplastic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, both directly through aberrant deposition of matrix proteins and indirectly through activation of stromal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Increased ECM density, reduced vascular perfusion and barrier function, and reduced lymphatic drainage all contribute to increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the breast cancer microenvironment, resulting in reduced immune cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and impaired drug distribution from blood to TCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Therapeutic strategies to normalize the desmoplastic breast cancer microenvironment are currently in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the patient-to-patient heterogeneity of breast cancer, hence its response to different treatments, makes it critical to identify personalized strategies with the greatest therapeutic potential.</p><p id="P4">Patient-derived TCs formed into structures with increasing cellular complexity – single-cell type spheroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, multi-cell type tumoroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and stem cell-derived organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> - have recently attracted attention as laboratory models to rapidly evaluate response to molecular therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Incorporating various “-oid” structures into microphysiological models presents the opportunity to broaden their scope and capture key morphological and functional aspects of the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.

However, current models have so far been unsuccessful in recapitulating the complexity of the desmoplastic breast cancer microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, particularly the aberrant ECM and vasculature, which jointly determine drug distribution into the tumor. Harnessing the capabilities of microphysiological models to recapitulate the pathophysiological complexity of the aberrant TC microenvironment in breast cancer desmoplasia could provide new therapeutic strategies to improve clinical care for breast cancer patients.</p><p id="P5">We have recently demonstrated culture of cancer spheroids assembled from ovarian and lung TC lines in microphysiological models containing human microvascular networks (MVNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These MVNs can be perfused with therapeutic molecules to assess their permeability across the vascular endothelium and resulting TC death. In this work, we expand on this methodology to culture tumoroids containing primary breast TCs or breast TC lines, evaluating their microenvironments to demonstrate differential desmoplastic stromal and vascular remodeling with resulting responsiveness to normalizing treatments. Herein, we show that these vascularized tumor models can both provide quantitative metrics to rank the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies, and empower the discovery of new molecular targets to normalize the desmoplastic breast cancer microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Vascularized tumoroids on-chip reproduce variations in breast cancer desmoplasia</title><p id="P6">We first made use of breast TC lines representative of three main disease molecular sub-types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> to establish the model’s capabilities: MCF7 (estrogen receptor, ER, and progesterone receptor, PR, positive), SKBR3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER2, positive) and MDA-MB-468 (“triple-negative”, epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, positive). Tumoroids approximately 500 µm in diameter were formed by co-culture of TCs with human fibroblasts (FBs) in non-adherent well plates for 4 days, which allowed the formation of stable cell aggregates even for TCs that would not aggregate in mono-culture (SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468). We employed our recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> methodology to co-culture the tumoroids in 3D gels within microfluidic devices containing human microvascular networks (MVNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), which self-assemble over 7 days from human endothelial cells (ECs) and the same FBs used to form the tumoroids. Gene expression analysis of therapeutic target receptors on TCs in tumoroid MVN devices confirmed high ER and PR in MCF7, high HER2 in SKBR3, and high EGFR in MDA-MB-468 in the MVN devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). EGFR gene expression significantly increases for all TCs isolated from the MVN devices compared to the same TCs cultured in 2D well plates, possibly due to signaling from additional cell types in the MVN devices. HER2 expression also increases approximately 10-fold for the MCF7 cells. As a result, measurable levels of EGFR and HER2 proteins are found in the microenvironment of all three tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Expression of those receptors is principally co-localized with the TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>), yet sectioning of tumoroids in MVN devices revealed a cytokeratin-rich core of dead TCs and, possibly, FBs where receptor expression is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). The tumoroid dead cores may be the result of hypoxia-induced necrosis, as previously observed in tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> and TC aggregates larger than 500 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and as suggested by high levels of HIF-1α expression in the tumoroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). These observations cumulatively show that enhanced pathophysiological receptor expression and localization can be recapitulated in the vascularized tumoroid models compared to more simplistic 2D TC mono-culture models.</p><p id="P7">The additional complexity of the vascularized tumoroid models extends to the ways in which TCs interact with and remodel their microenvironment. MCF7 cells remain tightly packed in the tumoroids, consistent with their high expression of the epithelial junction marker E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>), while the more mesenchymal SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 cells migrate out of the tumoroids to invade the stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a, e</xref>). Increased hyaluronic acid (HA) concentration is a hallmark of breast cancer desmoplasia and is associated with poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. HA deposition around the tumoroids is higher compared to the surrounding microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Yet, HA localization varies between tumoroids: HA forms a dense layer around MCF7 tumoroids, whereas it becomes progressively more diffuse and eventually localized with migrating TCs in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). We sought to understand whether the increased HA concentration measured in the tumoroid microenvironments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>) is a result of TC production. Gene expression analysis revealed higher production of high molecular weight HA (encoded by the HAS2 gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>) and expression of the HA receptor CD44 by MDA-MB-468 cells compared to the other TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). CD44 is an important adhesion molecule that TCs use to invade the stroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and its higher expression in MDA-MB-468 cells is consistent with their migratory phenotype. Interestingly, HAS2 expression in MDA-MB-468 cells significantly increases in the MVN devices compared to 2D mono-culture, again pointing to the importance of complex microenvironmental cues in modelling solid breast tumors. At the same time, SKBR3 cells have the lowest expression of HAS2 and CD44 among the TCs, and show increased expression for HA-degrading hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>), suggesting lower HA deposition by those TCs, and the presence of an additional source of HA in their microenvironment.</p><p id="P8">Through an altered fibrotic phenotype that develops as a result of signaling in the tumor microenvironment, cancer-associated FBs (CAFs) produce aberrant amounts of HA and collagen I that promote increased TC migration and tumor proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Analysis by immunofluorescence of a key marker for CAFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), revealed an increasing presence of CAFs in the MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-468 tumoroid microenvironments, in respective order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). The larger number of CAFs in the SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids may be the result of increased expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) by those TCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). We sought to understand the role of FBs in HA production within the MVN devices, and found increased expression of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>) and hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>), a marker of HA metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, in FBs in the vicinity (1 mm) of the tumoroids compared to control FBs in MVN devices without tumoroids. FBs appear more densely associated with the MDA-MB-468 tumoroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>), for which we also observed increased collagen I deposition. Remarkably, collagen I becomes aligned perpendicular to the tumoroid surface in the MDA-MB-468 tumoroids, as seen through the progression of breast cancer desmoplasia to form migration tracks for TCs to invade the stroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Overall, these results show that different tumoroids can alter their surrounding microenvironment in drastically different ways. In addition, despite the relative simplicity of TC lines compared to primary TCs, the tumoroids tested are capable of building complex microenvironments in the MVN devices that mimic key aspects of the progression of breast cancer desmoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Specifically, the MCF7 tumoroids appear to be representative of an early disease stage, where TCs still possess a primarily epithelial phenotype and a fibrotic ECM ‘sheath’ forms around the tumoroids that is associated with restricted TC migration and invasion; the MDA-MB-468 tumoroids, instead, may be representative of a later disease stage, whereby TCs aggressively invade the tumoroid microenvironment through a denser ECM deposited by both TCs and CAFs, with SKBR3 tumoroids somewhat in between these two extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1j</xref>). MDA-MB-468 tumoroids also recapitulate an additional feature of disease progression in that they often become vascularized by the surrounding MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We next assessed whether these vascular and ECM changes result in differences between drug distribution to the tumoroids.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Loss of vascular hyaluronic acid contributes to increased tumoroid interstitial fluid pressure</title><p id="P10">We have previously shown that MVNs in the vicinity of TC aggregates can partially lose vascular barrier function, resulting in higher permeability across the endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We observed the same phenomenon for the breast tumoroid models here, whereby focal leaks can be seen in the MVNs surrounding all three TC line tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). These localized leaks, in combination with a general loss of junctional integrity, result in increased MVN permeability in the vicinity of the SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids for dextran, a model large molecule (70 kDa) often used to benchmark vascular permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and for Trastuzumab (HER2-targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>) and Cetuximab (EGFR-targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mABs) used in the treatment of breast cancer. Remarkably, the near 3-fold increase in dextran permeability (2.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> in control MVNs to 8.1 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> in SKBR3 MVNs) is comparable with measurements in tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> (factor of ∼6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The loss of vascular barrier function appears to be incompatible with decreased drug distribution to the TME, whereby higher therapeutic molecule concentrations would be expected to reach the TCs across the leaky endothelium. However, our model allows the assessment of additional factors contributing to the impaired trans-vascular drug distribution in the tumor microenvironment to better understand this phenomenon. First, the morphology of the MVNs is altered in the vicinity of the tumoroids, as evidenced by a loss of vessel density and vessel specific surface area available for drug transport in the SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). Second, these morphological alterations also result in a loss of MVN perfusion capacity, whereby we observed lower tracer molecule concentrations in the vessels close to the tumoroids compared to vessels at a distance &gt; 5 mm in the same MVN devices (by a factor of approximately 0.3 - 0.5, as measured by proxy of fluorescence intensity, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">A third and key determinant of impaired drug distribution is the presence of elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the tumoroid microenvironments. This increase in IFP near the tumoroids is observed by comparing dextran permeabilities between control and tumoroid MVNs: When control MVNs are subjected to increasing intravascular pressure, the effective dextran permeability increases with applied pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>; the same trend is not observed in the tumoroid MVNs, and the resulting effective permeability at physiological intravascular pressure is comparable or lower than in control MVNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). This observation indirectly demonstrates that the pressure difference across the endothelium, which drives trans-vascular fluid flow and additional molecular transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, is lower in the tumoroid MVNs compared to control MVNs. This is also evidenced by the lack of interstitial fluid flow in the close vicinity of the tumoroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>) and the lack of vessel diameter expansion near the tumoroids under applied intravascular pressure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4d</xref>). Together with the lower vascular drug concentration and lower vessel surface area, the elevated IFP in the tumoroid microenvironment decreases overall drug transport across tumoroid MVNs despite the increased permeability of the vessels.</p><p id="P13">The elevated IFP in breast cancer desmoplasia hinders drug penetration and negatively correlates with cancer survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The vascularized tumoroid models present an opportunity to better understand this phenomenon and help identify therapeutic strategies that can improve drug delivery. It is well understood that increased ECM density in the desmoplastic stroma contributes to increased IFP by resisting the passage of interstitial flow via low matrix permeability, <italic>k</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. HA is a key determinant of this contribution through its capability to bind large quantities of fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Another, less understood contributor to elevated IFP is the leakiness of the vasculature, represented by an increased vascular hydraulic conductivity, <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>. We created a 1-dimensional computational model of the tumoroid MVN devices to assess the relevant contribution of <italic>k</italic> and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> to IFP in the vicinity of the tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).

The model results show that, starting from known values for the two factors in control MVNs (<italic>k</italic> ≈ 10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> ≈ 10<sup>-12</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> changes can have a greater impact on IFP than changes in <italic>k</italic>, warranting additional attention to the tumoroid MVNs and the causes of their higher permeability.</p><p id="P14">Vascular <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> depends on EC junction integrity and the presence of a functional glycocalyx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We did not observe changes in expression for genes associated with EC junctions between control and tumoroid MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>). However, immunostaining of the marker ZO-1 revealed wider EC junctions near the tumoroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6b</xref>), consistent with previous observations of EC junctions in tumors <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. HA associated with the vascular glycocalyx resists trans-vascular fluid flow as well as the passage of macromolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We made a key observation that the vascular glycocalyx in the vicinity of the tumoroids is severely degraded in terms of HA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Strikingly, gene expression analysis for HAS2 in ECs, which encodes glycocalyx-associated HA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, shows repression of the gene near the tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). At the same time, HYAL2 expression increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6c</xref>) and so does CD44 expression, as previously seen for ECs in the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Vascular glycocalyx degradation was further confirmed by a severe decrease in HA concentrations in the periphery of SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids (between 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm from the tumoroids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). Degradation of vascular HA in tumoroid MVNs also results in unchanged dextran permeability in SKBR3 MVNs after treatment of the MVNs with hyaluronidase (HA-ase), while the same treatment increases permeability in control MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6d</xref>). Crucially, HA-ase treatment of control MVNs increases <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> by one order of magnitude, from approximately 10<sup>-12</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>-11</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P15">These results confirm that vascular HA plays an important role in maintaining a low <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> in control MVNs, and that loss of vascular HA in tumoroid MVNs is associated with a concurrent increase in <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>, therefore in IFP. Despite its only partial role in elevated IFP, loss of vascular HA may be used as a marker for cancer-associated vascular dysfunction. For this reason, we next assessed possible causes for this change in the tumoroid MVNs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Inhibition of IL8 restores endothelial barrier function and enhances drug penetration</title><p id="P16">Vascular dysfunction in the tumoroid MVNs likely results from mechanical and/or biochemical cues specific to the aberrant microenvironments. Contact with a denser, thus stiffer, matrix can disrupt EC junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, the lack of mechanical cues from flow in poorly perfusable tumoroid MVNs may decrease glycocalyx expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. While we observed increased HAS2 expression for MVNs subjected to physiological vascular flow for 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>) and increased vascular HA concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6e</xref>), consistent with a decreased MVN permeability to dextran (4.1 × 10<sup>-9</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> compared to 1.1 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> in static conditions, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6d</xref>), we have previously observed functional vascular glycocalyx expression even under static MVN culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, as confirmed here by measurable expression levels for HAS2. In addition, no change in permeability or vascular HA was observed in the vicinity of the tumoroids irrespective of flow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6d, e</xref>). Thus, impaired vascular flow in the TME may only be partially responsible for the degradation of the vascular glycocalyx. Otherwise, pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been previously shown to induce rapid glycocalyx shedding in ECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We, therefore, characterized the pro-inflammatory milieu found in the tumoroid MVNs to explore its role in the loss of vascular HA.</p><p id="P17">Cytokine levels in TC condition media were first assessed with a broad pro-inflammatory cytokine array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>). MCF7 tumoroids appear to be less disruptive to MVN function compared to SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids. We identified five cytokines for which concentration is two-fold higher or more for SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 relative to MCF7 TCs: interleukin 8 and 12 (IL8, IL12), TNFα, and chemokine ligands 2 and 4 (CCL2, CCL4). Subsequent quantification of these cytokines in the lysed tumoroid microenvironments revealed higher concentrations of IL8 in both SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids (14 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 35 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> higher than control MVNs, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). MDA-MB-468 tumoroids also present higher concentrations of IL12, TNFα, and CCL4, consistent with the more developed pro-inflammatory milieu expected in later stages of breast cancer desmoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. These increased cytokine concentrations were local to the tumoroids, as analysis of supernatant collected from the MVN devices revealed much smaller changes from control MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We next set out to establish whether these cytokines directly contribute to vascular HA degradation. Recombinant versions of the five cytokines were perfused through control MVNs at a concentration of 5 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> to assess changes in permeability after short (&lt; 15 min) and long (12 hours) exposure times. TNFα and CCL2 increased MVN permeability to dextran at short times, while significant long-term changes were produced by IL8, IL12, TNFα, and CCL2, with IL8 showing the largest increase in permeability (1.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> to 5.7 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). End-point analysis of vascular HA concentration by immunofluorescence showed significant degradation by CCL2 at short times and IL8 at long times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>). Exposure of control MVNs to IL8 confirmed loss of vascular HA at concentrations as small as 1 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Interestingly, IL8 gene expression increases for all TCs in the MVN devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7d</xref>). IL8 has angiogenic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and its expression in TCs may be enhanced by paracrine signaling from ECs in the TME. Overall, these results point to IL8 as a candidate target cytokine to prevent vascular HA degradation, and subsequent loss of vascular barrier function.</p><p id="P19">We tested this hypothesis by treating MDA-MB-468 tumoroid MVNs with molecules directed against IL8: an IL8-blocking mAB, and the broad anti-inflammatory small molecule Dexamethasone. All treatments were administered in the MVN devices over 4 days. We first assessed changes in vascular HA concentrations, finding that both the IL8-blocking mAB and Dexamethasone aid in recovery of vascular HA expression to levels not significantly different from control MVNs (0.7 and 0.8 of controls, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). The two molecules also improve MVN perfusion near the tumoroids (intravascular concentration measured as 0.7 and 0.6 of distant controls for IL8-blocking mAB and Dexamethasone, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g, h</xref>). The treatments decreased tumoroid MVN dextran permeability to values comparable to control MVNs (2.3 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> and 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> for IL8-blocking mAB and Dexamethasone, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i</xref>) and increased effective permeability with applied intravascular pressure, indicating a decrease in vascular <italic>L</italic>

While HA-ase and the CD44-blocking mAB target stromal HA directly by degrading it or blocking TCs and FBs from binding to it, respectively, the TGFβ-blocking mAB indirectly targets HA by depriving FBs in the tumoroids of TGFβ, a key stimulant of stromal HA production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Similar to the treatments directed against IL8, blocking of CD44 and TGFβ in the tumoroid stroma decreased MVN permeability (2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> for CD44, 3.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> for TGFβ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) and IFP, as seen by an increase in effective MVN permeability with applied intravascular pressure. This effect was particularly pronounced for the CD44-blocking treatment, whereby effective permeability values were only slightly lower than for control healthy MVNs. HA-ase, instead, did not lower permeability (5.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup>), but rather increased effective permeability under intravascular pressure to levels higher than control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7e</xref>), likely the result of further degradation of vascular HA together with stromal HA. On average, all three treatments improved MVN perfusion near the tumoroids, with CD44-blocking showing the only significant increase in vascular molecular tracer concentration (to approximately 0.6 of the distant concentration levels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b, c</xref>).

Likely as a result of the different target concentrations, the treatments affected the tumoroids differently: All three treatments successfully and severely decreased stromal HA concentrations in the tumoroids, although the effect was greater by blocking TGFβ in the MCF7 and SKBR3 tumoroids and by blocking CD44 in the MDA-MB-468 tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). The greatest effect was achieved by HA-ase, which fully degraded HA in all three tumoroid types.</p><p id="P23">We further hypothesized that degradation of stromal HA can lead to increased drug distribution to TCs.

Preliminary data showed significant TC death in tumoroids in well plates at concentrations as low as 2 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> when assessed by fluorescence imaging of a cell death marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8a, b</xref>). We used the same method to evaluate cell death as a result of co-perfusion with the molecules targeting stromal HA in the MVN devices. Sections of the fixed tumoroids post-treatment revealed increased drug penetration compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>), validating our hypothesis that stromal HA degradation increases interstitial drug transport. Despite the relatively high mAB concentration perfused, significant cell death was observed only in the MCF7 tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>), confirming the negative effect of impaired vascular perfusion and increased ECM density on drug distribution to the tumoroids. Co-treatment with HA-ase of SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids increases TC death, and so does co-treatment with the TGFβ-blocking mAB for MCF7 and SKBR3 tumoroids, and with the CD44-blocking mAB for MDA-MB-468 tumoroids. Measurement of size change in the tumoroids was less conclusive, as a significant decrease in size over the four days can only by seen with co-treatment with HA-ase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8c</xref>), likely due to its particularly efficient degradation of stromal HA.</p><p id="P24">Overall, these results confirm our hypothesis that stromal HA degradation in the tumoroid microenvironments correlates with increased drug efficacy due to improved penetration.

Both patient-derived tumoroids become more highly vascularized by the MVNs compared to TC line tumoroids. The effect is particularly pronounced for Patient 2, for which the perfused dextran concentration near the tumoroids is not different from that in distant MVN vessels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). TCs from Patient 2 are also more invasive and seen to actively colonize the tumoroid MVNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>), consistent with the increased aggressiveness of the particular breast cancer sub-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (basal, compared to luminal for Patient 1). The morphology of the MVNs is similar between the two patient TCs, but the patient tumoroid MVNs possess a larger volume fraction and specific surface area compared to control MVNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9b</xref>). Vascular barrier function of the patient tumoroid MVNs is altered to a greater extent than the SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids, with increased permeability (1.5 × 10<sup>-7</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> and 9.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> cm s<sup>-1</sup> for Patient 1 and Patient 2, respectively) and a lack of a clear trend with applied intravascular pressure, confirming an increase in IFP even for these tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>).

We tested the treatment regimens described above to attempt normalization of the tumoroid microenvironments, including those treatments rebuilding vascular HA and those degrading stromal HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). All treatments produce an overall decrease in stromal HA concentration, although not significant for the IL8-blocking mAB in Patient 1 tumoroids and the TGFβ-blocking mAB in Patient 2 tumoroids. Aside from HA-ase, which virtually obliterates HA in the tumoroids, the decrease in HA concentration is greatest when blocking TGFβ in Patient 1 tumoroids and blocking CD44 in Patient 2 tumoroids. Remarkably, while the IL8 blocking mAB and Dexamethasone decrease overall HA concentrations less than the other treatments, they produce levels comparable to MVN controls, possibly indicating a greater extent of ECM normalization by targeting both the vascular and stromal HA. Most importantly, these results show that even when assembled from primary TCs, the vascularized tumoroid models are capable of capturing variations in the effectiveness of different treatments in normalizing the desmoplastic microenvironments.</p><p id="P27">Finally, we assessed the efficacy of the different treatments in producing changes in TC death when used in combination with Trastuzumab and Cetuximab, as previously done with the TC line tumoroids. We found that Patient 1 tumoroids are more susceptible to treatment with the therapeutic mABs compared to Patient 2 tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>), likely the result of differential expression of target receptors between the two TC types (HER2 expression confirmed by the supplier only for Patient 1 TCs). For Patient 1, cell death increases significantly with combination treatment with HA-ase and the TGFβ-blocking mAB, for which HA degradation was greatest, as similarly seen in MCF7 tumoroids. Despite the overall inefficacy of Trastuzumab and Cetuximab in targeting Patient 2 tumoroids, we observed increased cell death with combination treatment of the mABs with Dexamethasone (and, although not significant, with the IL8-blocking mAB). A different treatment approach, for example by standard small molecule chemotherapy or different mAB target, may prove more effective in producing significant TC death for Patient 2.

Of these treatments, TGFβ-targeting appears particularly attractive due to the key role uncovered for this factor in stimulating desmoplastic collagen and HA deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

At the same time, direct targeting of HA through CD44 can achieve greater normalizing responses for other patients, as seen in our results for models of advanced, aggressive breast cancer (MDA-MB-468 TC line and primary basal TCs).

Stromal HA degradation, instead, can prove beneficial to treatment by improving interstitial transport of therapeutic molecules to TCs.

It is tempting to speculate that treatments that can recover vascular HA while degrading stromal HA may be particularly beneficial in normalizing the breast cancer microenvironment and prevent disease progression.

Custom PCR plates (TaqMan 96 well-plate, ThermoFisher) were used to assess mRNA expression on a QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher) for the following genes: GAPDH, EGFR, ERBB2, PGR, ESR1, ABCB1, ABCG2, CXCL8, IL12A, CCL2, CCL4, TNF, VEGFA, FGF1, CDH1, HAS1, HAS2, HAS3, HYAL1, HYAL2, CD44, TJP1, CLDN5, OCLN, FCGRT, CAV1, CLTC. Gene expression was normalized to 18S endogenous control and GAPDH. Missing data values represent non-detectable signals. Protein expression was assessed in four ways: i) immunofluorescence staining of EGFR (Cetuximab, as above), HER2 (Trastuzumab, as above), cytokeratin (#M3515, Agilent), HA (HA binding protein, #385911, Sigma Aldrich), αSMA (#19245S, Cell Signaling Technology), HIF-1α (#ab8366, Abcam), Caspase-3 (#9661S, Cell Signaling Technology), COL-1 (#AF6220-SP, R&amp;D Systems), ZO-1 (#33-9100, ThermoFisher); ii) ProteinSimple automatic western analysis, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, of EGFR (#MAB9577, R&amp;D Systems), HER2 (#MAB9589, R&amp;D Systems), CD44 (#GTX102111, GeneTex, isoform assessed at peaks CD44s: 90 kDa, and CD44v: 160 kDa), TGFβ (#MAB1835, R&amp;D Systems); iii) Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of HA (#DHYAL0, R&amp;D Systems), normalized to total protein content, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (array, #ab134003, Abcam); iv) custom Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL8, IL12, CCL2, CCL4, TNFα. Protein quantification was performed on single 1 mm gel biopsy punches lysed in buffer (#9803S, Cell Signaling Technologies) containing Benzonase Nuclease (#E8263, Sigma Aldrich) and Protease inhibitor cocktail (#11836170001, Sigma Aldrich). Immunostaining was performed on either intact gels fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (#50-259-96, Fisher Scientific) within microfluidic devices, or on gels extracted from devices and embedded in Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound before cryosectioning on a Leica 1850 cryotome.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>4.5</label><title>MVN and tumoroid treatments</title><p id="P35">Treatments were administered in the microfluidic devices through perfusion across the MVNs.

Recombinant human IL8 (#208-IL-010, R&amp;D Systems), IL12 (#219-IL-005, R&amp;D Systems), TNFα (#210-TA-005, R&amp;D Systems), CCL2 (#279-MC-010, R&amp;D Systems), CCL4 (#271-BME-010, R&amp;D Systems) were perfused at a concentration of 5 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> together with dextran for short treatment-permeability testing (&lt; 15 min) and for 12 hrs for long treatment-testing. MVN and tumoroid treatments were administered over 4 days through daily media perfusion with an IL8 blocking antibody (20 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, #MAB208, R&amp;D Systems), Dexamethasone (5 µM, #D4902, Sigma Aldrich), HA-ase (as above), a CD44 blocking antibody (10 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 08-9407-2, American Research Products), and a TGFβ blocking antibody (20 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, #MAB1835, R&amp;D Systems). Trastuzumab (#MAB9589, R&amp;D Systems) and Cetuximab (#MAB9577, R&amp;D Systems) were co-perfused at a concentration of 20 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, and changes in cell death in the tumoroids assessed through imaging of SYTOX Green (#S34860, ThermoFisher) on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a 4X objective. The SYTOX signal intensity was measured using ImageJ in the area co-localized with the RFP TC signal. Changes in size of the tumoroids as a result of the different treatments were measured in terms of changes in projected area, also through the RFP TC signal. For the primary, non-fluorescent TCs, the SYTOX signal intensity was measured in a circular area of diameter 1 mm from the center of the tumoroids.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><label>4.6</label><title>Data interpretation and statistics</title><p id="P36">The number of technical and biological repeats is reported in each figure caption.
