However, it remains unclear if, in the human host, the parasite can dynamically allocate resources to the differentiation of sexual-stage gametocytes that are transmitted to mosquitos, particularly in areas of seasonal malaria where the size of the mosquito population fluctuates dramatically during the dry and wet seasons. During blood feedings, infected Anopheles mosquitoes deposit <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sporozoites in the human dermis that find their way into circulation, reaching the liver where they infect hepatocytes. After 7-10 days of parasite replication, each infected hepatocyte releases thousands of merozoites into the blood stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), where they start continuous asexual intra-erythrocytic replication cycles of ~48 h, from merozoite invasion of red blood cells (RBCs), through the ring- and trophozoite-stages, until the multinucleated schizont releases new merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). A small proportion of intra-erythrocytic asexual parasites differentiate into sexual-stage gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Instead of another ~48 h asexual schizogony leading to the 8-30 new merozoites ready to continue asexual cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), the parasite subsequently develops into sexually committed schizonts leading to 8-30 sexually committed merozoites. Upon infection of new RBCs each sexually committed merozoite produces one stage I gametocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) that through a period of 8-12 days will go through five developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), where nuclear reshaping is driven by intranuclear microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Stages II to IV of gametocytaemia take place in the bone marrow or spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), while stage V gametocytes are again present in peripheral blood, each lasting up to ~20 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) waiting for another mosquito bite. Following a blood meal gametocytes encounter the right environment for sexual reproduction in the mosquito midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). They transform into female and male gametes that fuse into a zygote originating oocysts which invade the midgut wall to generate sporozoites. These sporozoites later reach the mosquito salivary glands and can restart the parasite lifecycle after being taken up in the next blood meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The continued presence of mosquitoes and humans in a geographical region allows for perennial <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transmission.</p><p id="P6">However, in areas where the dry season is several months long, the mosquito population can plummet to near zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), interrupting transmission. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> faces the challenge of surviving in its human host for months while waiting for the return of mosquitoes as the wet season ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). During mosquito-free dry periods, gametocyte production is largely wasted, as gametocytes cannot survive to bridge two wet seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Although curtailing gametocyte production rates during the dry season would seem beneficial to the parasite, such a strategy would require a mechanism to reactivate gametocytogenesis with the return of rain and mosquitos. Host factors such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), haematocrit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), haemoglobin type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and duration of malaria symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) have been linked to gametocytaemia in individuals with clinical malaria; and higher frequencies of gametocyte positive individuals have been observed in chronic asymptomatic infections compared to acute infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Additionally, various in vitro conditions have been shown to modulate sexual commitment and thus gametocytogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The specific effect of lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) in repressing the pro-sexual commitment transcription factor AP2G has been recently identified, with low Lyso-PC concentrations increasing the proportion of sexual forms in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Furthermore, gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) has been identified as the de-repressing effector which counters the epigenetic silencing and promotes AP2G expression leading to the induction of gametocytogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), and homeodomain protein 1 (HDP1) was recently identified as a positive transcriptional regulator essential for gametocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Still, it is not fully understood how sexual investment and gametocytaemia is regulated in vivo, and if or how transmission to mosquitoes can be optimized by the parasite to conserve resources. Recently, we have shown that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites isolated at the end of the dry season are transcriptionally distinct from those of subjects with febrile malaria in the transmission season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), but alteration of sexual commitment and gametocytogenesis were not investigated. The observed transcriptional differences reflected longer parasite circulation within each ~48 h intra-erythrocytic cycle in the dry season, likely increasing splenic clearance of infected cells and thus maintaining the low parasitaemias observed during the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Here, we aimed to examine sexual commitment and gametocytogenesis of parasites persisting through the dry season and explored possible parasite adaptations during extended periods in the human host. We quantified sexual commitment and female and male gametocyte densities in blood samples collected from children at different times of the year with different clinical presentations and seasonality patterns, and related them to total parasite density and infection length. Furthermore, we determined longitudinally the Lyso-PC concentration in plasma of children, and assessed its ability to induce <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual commitment and gametocytogenesis in vitro. Finally, we adapted a previously described within-host mathematical model that considers asexual parasites, sexually committed parasites, and gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) to infer the dynamics of gametocyte number and proportion as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infections progress from recently transmitted to chronic asymptomatic carriage over several months.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Gametocyte gene expression analysis</title><p id="P7">We used RNAseq data of leucocyte-depleted blood pellets from 12 children with asymptomatic malaria at the end of the dry season and an age- and gender-matched cohort presenting with their first malaria case in the ensuing transmission season reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Originally 808 gametocyte specific genes were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and we counted 786 after excluding repetitions and converting nomenclature to its most recent version (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Out of these 786 genes, we detected normalized reads of 333 gametocyte-specific genes in the RNAseq data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) to perform a principal component analysis. Using Deseq2, 205 genes were determined to be differentially expressed between the dry season and malaria cases.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Analysis of early and late gametocyte markers in RNA-seq data</title><p id="P8">We compiled a list of early and late gametocyte specific genes based on three RNA-seq studies comparing distinct parasite stages, including data from Poran et al. 2017(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) obtained after request from the corresponding author (compared day 2 versus day 9 of gametocytogenesis by single cell RNAseq); data from Lopez-Barragan et al. 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (compared day 4 versus day 15 of gametocytogenesis by bulk RNAseq) and data from Jeninga et al., <italic>under review</italic> (compared day 4 of gametocytogenesis versus day 10 of FACS sorted male and female gametocytes by bulk RNAseq). Poran et al. selected early and late gametocyte genes as genes showing a 20-fold higher expression in early or late gametocytes over the respective other group. Late gametocyte genes were also required to show a 20-fold higher expression in late gametocytes compared to ring stage parasites, this was not the case for early gametocyte genes. In Lopez-Barrgagan’s data, early gametocyte genes were defined as genes having a 10-fold expression increase in early gametocytes compared to late gametocytes. Genes showing a 20-fold higher expression in late stages were designated as late gametocyte genes. Expression differences to asexual stages were not considered. In Jeninga et al. <italic>under review</italic> genes showing a 3-fold or higher expression difference to both asexual stages and late gametocytes were selected as early gametocyte genes, regardless of gametocyte sex. Intersecting the full list of early and late gametocyte genes with genes transcribed in circulating parasites stages, defined by RNAseq data of Andrade et al., generated a final list of 109 early gametocyte genes and 54 late gametocyte genes to evaluate expression differences of these genes between dry and rainy seasons. Intersecting the early and late gametocyte list with all gametocyte genes reported by Painter et al. we receive 456 gametocyte genes that are detected in the wet vs dry season RNAseq dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Study subjects and ethical approval</title><p id="P9">Approval by the Ethics Committee of Heidelberg University Hospital, the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Odontostomatology (FMPOS) at the University of Bamako, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board was obtained to conduct the study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier <underline>NCT01322581</underline>. Clinical data and samples were obtained from 2017 to 2019 in a cohort study previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali, where malaria transmission occurs between June and December, and antimalarial drugs are provided by a single clinic and pharmacy.

Exclusion criteria at enrolment included haemoglobin &lt;7 g/dL, axillary temperature ≥37.5°C, acute systemic illness, or use of antimalarial or immunosuppressive medications in the 30 days preceding enrolment. Clinical malaria cases were prospectively determined by passive surveillance and defined by axillary temperature ≥37.5°C, ≥2500 asexual parasites/μL of blood, and no other evident cause of fever. Malaria episodes were treated with a 3-day standard course of artemether/lumefantrine according to Malian national guidelines. Cross-sectional clinical visits and blood draws were performed late in the transmission season (October), and at the beginning (January), mid (March) and end (May) of the dry season.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P10">Venous blood (4 mL if donor age was below 4 years, and 8 mL if above) was drawn by venepuncture on wet and dry season cross-sectional visits, and at first malaria episode of the transmission season.

RNA was quantified by absorption measurements at 230, 260 and 280 nm on a Citation3 Imaging plate reader, followed by cDNA synthesis using the Superscript IV Enzyme (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions. Taqman RT-qPCR multiplex assay (Applied Biosystems) was performed on a qTower (Analytic Jena) with primers to quantify the female gametocyte marker ookinete surface protein P25 (PF3D7_1031000), the male gametocyte transcript PFMGET (Pf3D7_1469900), the master regulator of sexual commitment Ap2G (PF3D7_1222600) and a parasite housekeeping gene (Glycine-tRNA ligase, PF3D7_1420400). Amplification efficiency (E) was estimated on the basis of the equation E=(10^(-1/slope)-1)x100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). NF54 parasite line expressing DyneinGFP and carrying an episomal P47mCherry plasmid (DynGFP/P47mCherry) was used for sorting of male and female gametocytes through their respective specific mCherry and/or GFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).

Likewise, PfMGET expression was approximately 10-fold higher expressed in male gametocytes (GFP+) compared to females (mCherry+), consistent with 5-7% impurity. Linear regression fit for the independent populations revealed a good fit with R<sup>2</sup>-values of 0.93-0.97 by P25 expression and 0.96-0.98 by PfMGET expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The asexual parasites standard curve, was generated with Pf2004 asexual culture was counted by FACS and Glycine-tRNA ligase expression was quantified in dilution series of 10-10<sup>7</sup> asexual late rings per ml. The combination of asexual and sexual standard curves was used for qPCR quantification of female or male proportion of total parasitaemias throughout the season. To account for fluorescence leakage between channels a compensation matrix was calculated based on single colour fluorescence measurements by an application specialist at Analytic Jena. Gexp5 (PF3D7_0936600) expression levels were quantified in a Taqman RT-qPCR duplex assay together with Glycine-tRNA ligase as a housekeeping gene.

Average levels of parasitaemia and gametocytaemia during each asymptomatic infection, were estimated as the area under curve over the course of infection divided by length of infection. For symptomatic infections, only the quantification before treatment on day of diagnosis was considered. For comparison between two data sets, a multiple non-parametric comparison between groups of asymptomatic and symptomatic in Mali and Uganda has been performed using Tukey-Correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Mathematical model</title><p id="P17">The developed mathematical model extends a model used previously to describe asexual parasite and gametocytes dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The model considers 3 different main parasite populations, i.e., distinguishing between asexual parasites (P), sexually committed parasites (P<sub>G</sub>) and gametocytes (G). Asexual parasites develop and replicate within a red blood cell over a cycle of length a<sub>L</sub>=48h after which mature schizonts burst and release a number of <italic>r<sub>P</sub></italic> = 18-32 merozoites that are able to invade new red blood cells.

Increased parasite removal is considered to occur 14 days post start of blood stage malaria infection and indicates the beginning of the transition phase from the acute towards the chronic asymptomatic phase of infection. In addition, as selection for less adhesive and less virulent parasite strains by an active immune response is considered to be crucial for the maintenance of a malaria infection over the course of several dry season months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), we accounted for this effect in our model by an increased value of <italic>T<sub>σ</sub></italic> for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">Eq. (3)</xref> during the chronic asymptomatic phase, i.e., replacing <italic>T<sub>σ</sub></italic> by <italic>T<sub>σ3</sub></italic>. Altering this parameter shifts clearance rates towards affecting older asexual parasite stages, leading to a constant, but oscillating number of asexual parasite numbers in circulation. <italic>Parameter estimation:</italic> The model described in Eqs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD10">10</xref>) was applied to the data assuming a fixed parasite life-cycle period of a<sub>L</sub>=48 h, a sequestration age of as= 20 hpi, as well as a parameter of <italic>T<sub>σ</sub></italic>=32 h and <italic>p<sub>σ</sub></italic>=0.7 characterizing age-dependent parasite removal during the acute infection phase. All other parameters were fitted to both symptomatic and asymptomatic time points simultaneously using an approximative Bayesian computing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Prior distributions for the individual parameters spanning biologically reasonable ranges have been selected in accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Due to the high model complexity and parameter dependencies, estimations of multiple pyABC-runs diverge to different local minima for the individual parameters. To obtain robust results for the parameters indicating phase-dependent changes, several independent pyABC fitting runs were compared and the 6<sup>th</sup> generation was chosen where parameter posterior distributions would still overlap. For the fitting, values of individual patients in the dry season are condensed to one time point by calculating the average levels based on the area under the curve over the course of dry season patient surveillance. Values were log10-transformed to ensure comparability of parasitaemia and gametocytemia. In addition, wet and dry season measurements were assumed to represent the parasite dynamics at 2- and 6-weeks postinfection, respectively. Sensitivity of the results with regard to these time points was investigated. In addition, different values for the fraction of sexually committed parasites, f, were tested.

Now, we gathered a list of genes related to gametocytogenesis from multiple RNAseq published and unpublished studies to query potential adaptations of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual stages to persistence periods. Painter et al. reported, with in vitro culture parasites, 786 gametocyte-related transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and of those 333 showed detectable number of reads in our dry vs wet season dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (Table 1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Poran et al. described with single cell RNAseq analysis early and late gametocyte transcripts based on a 20-fold differential expression comparing day 2 versus day 9 of gametocytogenesis (late gametocyte genes were defined by 20-fold higher expression compared to ring stage parasites, although this was not the case for early gametocyte genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We found that 2 out of 3 transcripts and 15 out of 17 from early- and late-gametocyte transcripts, respectively, were detected at the end of our dry season asymptomatic versus wet season clinical case dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (Table 1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In addition, data from Lopez-Barragan et al. 2011 compared bulk RNAseq of day 4 versus day 15 of gametocytogenesis and identified early-gametocyte genes through a 10-fold increase of expression in early compared to late gametocytes. Genes showing a 20-fold higher expression in late stages were designated as late-gametocyte genes, but expression differences to asexual stages were not considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Forty-one and 58 transcripts were called early- and late-gametocyte related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) and of those 32 and 44 were detected in the end of our dry season asymptomatic versus wet season clinical case dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (Table 1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). Finally, Jeninga et al. (personal communication, <italic>under review)</italic> obtained data comparing bulk RNAseq data of day 4 versus day 10 of gametocytogenesis in FACS-sorted male and female gametocytes defined early-female and early-male specific gametocyte transcripts with a 3-fold or higher expression difference to both asexual stages and late gametocytes. Nineteen transcripts were assigned to early gametocytes independent of sex, and 38 and 186 transcripts were identified as early-female, and early-male gametocyte-related genes respectively. Of those, 15 and 64 were detected at the end of our dry season asymptomatic versus wet season clinical cases dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (Table 1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The full list of 1048 sexual commitment- and gametocytogenesis-related genes showed limited overlap between the different reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) potentially due to the different timepoints and comparison conditions defined in the different studies. Intersecting this list with transcripts of circulating parasites of the 12 asymptomatic Malians at the end of the dry season and 12 clinical malaria cases in the wet season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) resulted in 456 transcripts. Principal component analysis of expression values of these genes showed a clear segregation of transcription profiles based on seasonality and clinical presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and produced clear patterns on a heatmap clustering malaria cases (MAL) or end of the dry season asymptomatic samples (May) by similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Of note, transcripts characteristic of late stage gametocytes appeared especially enriched in upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in samples of asymptomatic carriers in the dry season versus malaria cases in the wet season. We identified 159 gametocyte-specific transcripts defining early- or late-gametocyte development stages with quantifiable reads in samples of circulating parasites persisting through the dry season and parasites causing malaria in the wet season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Of those, 105 transcripts define early-stage gametocytes; and 54 transcripts are characteristic of late-stage gametocytes (highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Expression of these transcripts in asymptomatic carriers at the end of the dry season (May) and malaria cases (MAL) in the wet season showed an enrichment of upregulated transcripts of late-stage gametocytes in the dry season. While 81,48% (44/54 genes, Chi<sup>2</sup> <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.00001) of late-stage gametocyte transcripts were upregulated in the dry season, only 39,05% (41/105 genes, Chi<sup>2</sup> <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.231933) of early-gametocyte transcripts and 33,4% (1131/3381 genes) of total <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transcripts were upregulated in the dry season, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transcripts of female (P25, PF3D7_1031000) or male (PFMGET, Pf3D7_1469900) late stage gametocytes were upregulated alongside other late sexual stage transcripts (highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and P25 difference was also confirmed by qRT-PCR through the proportional quantification of female gametocytes out of total parasites, while PFMGET qRT-PCR showed a non-significant trend of the proportion of males out of total parasites between clinical malaria sample and asymptomatic at the end of the dry season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). On the other hand, transcripts known to regulate sexual commitment (AP2G, PF3D7_1222600; and GDV1, PF3D7_0935400), to be present in sexually committed schizonts (MSRP1, PF3D7_1335000), or to be markers of early gametocytes (GEXP5, PF3D7_0936600) were not significantly different in the RNAseq analysis (highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) nor qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Decreased transcription of late-stage gametocyte genes in symptomatic cases of malaria during the wet season coincided with lower levels of phospholipids measured through shotgun lipidomics in the plasma of the same children that is known to influence <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual commitment in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Malaria cases in the wet season (MAL) had lower levels of several species of the Lyso-PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and lysophosphatidyle-thanolamine (Lyso-PE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) families compared to asymptomatic carriers at the end of the dry season (May). Decreasing Lyso-PC levels have been shown in vitro to increase <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Hence, we questioned if the reduction in Lyso-PC and Lyso-PE species in plasma of malaria cases compared to persistent infections at the end of the dry season could induce <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual conversion or gametocytaemia differently in vitro. We exposed parasites of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 2004 line (Pf2004) to plasma of children collected during clinical malaria cases (MAL) in thewet season, or to those of asymptomatically infected children at the end of the dry season (May) alongside the conditions described by Brancucci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) to induce or inhibit sexual convertion and gametocyteamia. As reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), we observed that 24 h after culturing Pf2004 without plasma or serum (noPl), and thus no Lyso-PC, over minimal fatty acid medium (MFA), AP2G expression increased compared to parasites cultured in the presence of German control plasma (PlDE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). However, MFA medium supplementation with 25% plasma from children presenting with clinical malaria in the wet season (PlMAL), versus plasma from children with asymptomatic infections at the end of the dry season (PlMay) resulted in similar APG2 induction 48 h after beginning of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and similar conversion rate of parasites into gametocytes on day 5 after treatment (defined by = d5gametocytes/ d2parasites) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Absence of plasma (noPl) resulted in higher gametocytaemia than observed within German pooled plasma condition (PlDE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), plasma from malaria cases (PlMAL) or asymptomatic infections at the end of the dry season (PlMay), all revealing similar conversion rates. Although the 2-4 fold Lyso-PC differences between non-infected or asymptomatic children and malaria cases were significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), these were much lower than the several orders of magnitude included in the standard curve used to establish that gametocyte conversion responds to decreasing Lyso-PC in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> gametocyte density is higher in clinical cases of malaria than in asymptomatic infection regardless of seasonality</title><p id="P24">We determined the density of total <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites (Glycine-tRNA ligase, PF3D7_1420400), female (P25, PF3D7_1031000) and male (PFMGET, Pf3D7_l469900) gametocytes, based on standard curves obtained from total and sorted gender-specific fluorescent gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), and detected higher numbers of both total parasites, and of female and male gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) per mL of blood in clinical cases of malaria during the wet season (MAL) compared to asymptomatic carriers at the end of the dry season (May). This highlighted that the increased proportion of gametocytes shown by the over-expression of transcripts of late stage gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was linked to lower parasite and gametocyte densities in asymptomatic infections at the end of the dry season.</p><p id="P25">Furthermore, we determined the dynamics of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual commitment and gametocytogenesis in persistently infected individuals continuously infected throughout the dry season. We quantified the density of total parasites, and fully formed female and male gametocytes by qRT-PCR at four different time points in asymptomatic children persistently infected from the wet (Oct) until the end of the dry season (through Jan, Mar and May), and in a parallel group of age-matched individuals presenting with clinical malaria during the ensuing wet season (MAL). We observed that total parasite density was higher in malaria cases (MAL) than at any time-point of the asymptomatic infections, whether in the wet (Oct) or the dry season (Jan, Mar and May). In contrast, no differences were found between any of the time points of asymptomatic infections (Oct, Jan, Mar and May) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, we observed higher densities of both female and male gametocytes in malaria cases (MAL) than at any time point of the asymptomatic infections (Oct, Jan, Mar and May), and no differences within the persisting period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Conversely, the proportion of male gametocytes was higher at later time points of persisting infections (Mar or May) than in malaria cases during the transmission season (MAL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), while AP2G was again not found to significantly vary across season or clinical presentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We also examined associations between plasma Lyso-PC and Lyso-PE, monitoring longitudinally ~20 children who were continuously infected from the wet season until the end of the dry season. Quantification of Lyso-PC 18:0 in malaria cases compared to asymptomatic infections progressing from the wet into the dry season again resulted in decreased Lyso-PC values in clinical malaria cases (MAL) compared to asymptomatic infections (Oct, Mar and May) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We further detected a decrease of Lyso-PC from the wet season (Oct) to the end of the dry season (May), but no difference was observed between the two available time points of the dry season (Mar and May) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, Lyso-PC 18:0 levels in persistent infections (Oct, Mar and May) were comparable to non-infected individuals at the end of the dry season (May<sup>-</sup>), indicating that asymptomatic infections have no impact on Lyso-PC 18:0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Accordingly, a relation between Lyso-PC levels and parasitaemia or gametocytaemia was only significant when considering clinical malaria plus all asymptomatic samples (Oct, Mar, May and MAL) (r=-0.68 p&lt; 0.0001; r=-0.56 p&lt; 0.008 and r=-0.67 p&lt; 0.0001 for parasitaemia, female and male gametocytaemia respectively), but disappeared when each group was analysed independently, or in all persisting asymptomatic infections analysed together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Additionally, we investigated if the observed patterns of gametocyte densities and proportions were generalizable to non-seasonal settings where infections also persist. While Mali shows a very contrasting seasonal pattern with 5-6 months interruption of transmission every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), Uganda has uninterrupted year-round transmission with peaks in times of stronger rain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). RT-qPCR data quantifying transcripts of total parasite (varATS) and gametocyte (P25, PF3D7_1031000) densities from samples of 150 Ugandan individuals with asymptomatic parasitaemias persisting for over one month (n=122) and age-matched individuals presenting with clinical malaria (n=38) had been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and were retrieved from ClinEpiDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Determining average parasite levels during the asymptomatic phase calculated by the area under the curve over the course of infection normalized by the time of infection, indicated that parasite and gametocyte densities were increased in clinical malaria cases (MAL) compared to asymptomatic infections (Asymp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of gametocyte transcripts relative to total <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> transcripts showed again an inverse trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), as seen within the Malian samples, where the proportion of gametocytes was higher in persisting parasitaemias (Asymp) compared to malaria cases (MAL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Progressing infection leads to apparent differences in gametocytogenesis</title><p id="P27">We observed decreased densities but higher proportions of female or male gametocytes in asymptomatic versus clinical malaria, without concomitant differences in the expression of regulators of sexual commitment, or transcriptional markers of sexually committed schizonts or early gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Attempting to explain this, we devised a mathematical model considering three different parasite populations - asexual parasites (P), sexually committed parasites (P<sub>G</sub>) and gametocytes (G), all of which can circulate or be adherent - as previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). As the original model by Cao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) was not able to sufficiently explain the observed dynamics when fitted to the data, we extended the model in different ways. First, we incorporated our recent observation of increased clearance of longer-circulating infected erythrocytes in persisting parasitaemias compared to recently transmitted parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), which promoted different removal rates of asexual and sexually-committed parasites during distinct phases of acute and chronic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref> and Source code 1). In addition, we distinguish between three phases <italic>during P. falciparum</italic> infection in which the parasite multiplication factor varies due to immune response or adhesive properties of the parasite, in agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and Malian data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Using an iterative Bayesian fitting-approach to fit the model to the symptomatic and asymptomatic parasitaemia and gametocytaemia levels of the Malian cohort, we quantitatively assessed several biological parameters including sexual commitment rate, gametocyte circulation time, parasite multiplication rate and gametocyte sequestration time, thereby confirming previously determined ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Our adapted model was able to provide a dynamic depiction of parasitaemia levels, and gametocyte densities and proportions, as we observed within the Malian data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found that the death rate of asexual and sexually committed parasites increased at later stages of the 48 h cycle, shifting toward the removal of older parasite stages and leading to a constant but oscillating number of asexual parasite in circulation (highlighted in the box-inlay of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This oscillation, may be explained by the variation seen in parasitaemias, especially during the chronic phase where we pooled individual measurements collected across different time-points and calculated averages from each individual by the area under the curve (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Keeping a constant fraction of sexually committed parasites, f, throughout acute and chronic infection phases, our model predicts a higher number and lower proportions of gametocytes in the acute phase - a trend that is inverted during the transition phase of infection due to effective removal of asexual parasites by an active immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). During the chronic phase of infection, when parasitaemias remain constant or are slowly decreasing, gametocyte proportions are also decreasing until an equilibrium is reached roughly 4-5 months after the start of blood stage infection.</p><p id="P28">Additionally, we tested the effect of increased sexual commitment during the chronic phase of infection in our model. We observed that increasing sexual commitment We observed that increasing sexual commitment from 0.54-0.76% (89% credibility interval of pyABC fitting approach) to 2 or 20% during the chronic stage of infection led to steady and constant losses in parasitaemia, which would, especially at very high sexual commitment rates, lead to parasite clearance and substantially increased gametocyte proportions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). A high fraction of sexually committed parasites during the chronic phase of infection would prevent a stable level of parasitaemia over several months without reinfection. Overall, our model provides a dynamic depiction of gametocyte densities and proportions as observed in the data from Mali and Uganda, without the necessity to alter the sexual commitment rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C and D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">The relative absence of mosquitoes during the months-long dry season and the short lifespan of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sexual-stage gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) renders the production of gametocytes ineffective during most of the dry season. However, to ensure parasite reproduction, gametocytes must be available to resume malaria transmission when mosquitos return with the wet season. Whether <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> maintains a constant rate of production of sexual forms or adjusts gametocytogenesis to maximize transmission has been unclear. In this study, with samples from Malians exposed to alternating 6-month dry and wet seasons, and samples from clinical malaria and asymptomatic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection from year-round transmission region of Uganda, we showed that symptomatic cases of malaria consistently have higher parasite and stage V gametocyte densities than asymptomatic infections. However, the proportion of gametocytes is increased in the asymptomatic persisting infections. Additionally, our data from Mali indicated that transcription of genes characterizing sexually committed parasites and stage I gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) quantified by RT-qPCR did not appear affected by the season or clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), nor were reads of over 100 genes characteristic of early gametocytes and detected by RNAseq of circulating parasites particularly enriched for DEGs.

Our work suggests that gametocytogenesis remains constant as infections progress from recent transmission to chronic carriage, and it is the difference in asexual survival/replication rates that promotes different gametocyte densities, independently of environmental factors.</p><p id="P30">Although it has been suggested that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> investment in gametocyte production adjusts to host nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), drug pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), transmission intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), and even seasonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), results are often inconsistent and potentially affected by the dynamics of asexual parasite growth, without necessarily indicating altered sexual commitment. In Sudan, following the long dry season, gametocyte density estimates have been reported to increase prior to the highest transmission peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), suggesting a higher gametocyte investment. However, in Burkina Faso, gametocyte densities were higher at the peak and end of the transmission season rather than during the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), while the efficiency of membrane feeding to infect mosquitoes was increased early in the transmission season compared to peak of the malaria season or the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Nevertheless, these studies did not monitor longitudinally the same parasite population during the dry and early wet season. In a recent study also in Burkina Faso, transmission was shown to be more effective in persistent than in incident infections, but no data was collected after day 35, and collections were all done during the wet season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) when a mix of more and less recently transmitted parasite clones is likely in individuals without symptoms.</p><p id="P31">In vitro, depletion of Lyso-PC or choline have been shown to induce AP2G expression, leading to increased gametocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), but associations in humans are inconsistent. In Rwanda, low Lyso-PC associated with higher parasite densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>); and in Ghana, although correlations with parasitaemia were not reported, Lyso-PC levels in human blood samples were inconsistently related with gametocyte-committed ring stages converting into gametocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).

Specifically, sub-curative doses of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) stimulate AP2G expression and sexual conversion when drug exposure occurs at the trophozoite stage, but not at the early ring stage.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and Portugaliza et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that Lyso-PC levels in particular bone marrow niches are sufficiently low to trigger parasites’ sexual commitment, although this would require that infected erythrocytes be at that niche to respond to the stimulus.</p><p id="P33">Previous reports highlighting differences in gametocytogenesis as a product of altered sexual commitment did not account for longevity of infection, nor for dynamic changes within the asexual compartment during a persistent infection. Greischar et al. demonstrated the difficulty of quantifying true transmission investment by comparing existing quantification methods on simulated data where true transmission investment is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), and Prajapati and colleagues relied on in vitro culture of sexually committed circulating parasites to define samples with higher and lower commitment rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Also, our study has limitations as it is possible that our quantifications of parasite and gametocyte densities are affected by imperfectly comparable primer efficiencies, which would also affect comparisons of female, male and total gametocyte densities across different transcripts measurements. Although we also do not have true longitudinal data, our model can explain the observed patterns by assuming transitions from a faster to a slower growth rate, as e.g. due to the development of immunity which has been recorded from malaria-therapy used to treat neurosyphilis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Despite these limitations, our analyses show that the proportion of sexual stages is inversely related in recent transmissions versus chronic infections, without alteration in the expression of regulators of sexual commitment and while maintaining a constant rate of sexual commitment. Our recent study in which we found that infections that persist beyond the acute immune response exhibit prolonged circulation and increased splenic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) allowed us to complement the model by Cao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) with an increased asexual parasite death rate following the immuno-responsive period, which promoted the progressively increased representation of sexual stages in later phases of the infection. Low gametocyte proportions early on in infection can be explained by the fact that asexual replication efficiently increases while adaptive immunity is absent and the lag of ~8 days of gametocyte development in the bone marrow has its impact. In our model we propose that later immunity prevents fast asexual growth and parasites persisting further are more efficiently removed in the spleen sustaining low parasitaemias. By introducing these concepts into our model, we can observe the opposite lag effect later in infection when the proportion of gametocytes finally reflects, despite keeping the same sexual commitment rate, that of parasitaemias ~8 days earlier. In contrast, assuming increased fractions of sexually committed parasites during the chronic phase of infection, our model would predict a constant loss of parasitemia and eventual clearance of infection.</p><p id="P34">In conclusion, our data is consistent with a model in which <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> maintains a constant rate of sexual commitment such that the proportion of gametocytes increases over time as infection persists and asexual parasite numbers decline more rapidly, a strategy that may help overcome the vector-free period and increase transmission efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS154575-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the residents of Kalifabougou, Mali and Nangonera, Uganda for participating in the studies.
