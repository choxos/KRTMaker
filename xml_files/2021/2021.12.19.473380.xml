<abstract>
<p id="P1">The newly reported Omicron variant is poised to replace Delta as the most rapidly spread SARS-CoV-2 variant across the world. Cryo-EM structural analysis of the Omicron variant spike protein in complex with human ACE2 reveals new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed by mutated residues R493, S496 and R498 in the RBD with ACE2. These interactions appear to compensate for other Omicron mutations such as K417N known to reduce ACE2 binding affinity, explaining our finding of similar biochemical ACE2 binding affinities for Delta and Omicron variants. Neutralization assays show that pseudoviruses displaying the Omicron spike protein exhibit increased antibody evasion, with greater evasion observed in sera obtained from unvaccinated convalescent patients as compared to doubly vaccinated individuals (8- vs 3-fold). The retention of strong interactions at the ACE2 interface and the increase in antibody evasion are molecular factors that likely contribute to the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant.</p>

<p id="P2">The Omicron (B.1.1.529.1) variant, first reported on November 24, 2021, was quickly identified as a variant of concern with potential to spread rapidly across the world. There is widespread concern about the speed with which the Omicron variant is currently circulating even amongst doubly vaccinated individuals. The Omicron variant spike protein has 3-5 times more mutations than that seen in any of the previous SARS-CoV-2 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Understanding the consequences of these mutations for ACE2 receptor binding and neutralizing antibody evasion is important in guiding the development of effective therapeutics to limit the spread of the Omicron and related variants.</p>
<p id="P3">The Omicron variant has 37 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) in the spike protein relative to the initial Wuhan strain, with 15 of them present in the receptor binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The RBD is the region of the spike protein that mediates both attachment to human cells via the ACE2 receptor and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The Delta variant, which was the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage until the emergence of Omicron, has 7 mutations in the spike protein relative to the Wuhan strain but only two of these mutations (T478K and D614G) are in common with the Omicron strain. Analysis of the sequence of the Omicron genome suggests that it is not derived from any of the currently circulating variants, and may have a different origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Cryo-EM structural analysis of the Omicron spike protein ectodomain shows that the overall organization of the trimer is similar to that observed for the ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and all earlier variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The RBD in one of the protomers (protomer 1) is well-resolved and is in the “down” position, while the other two RBDs are less well-resolved because they are flexible relative to the rest of the spike protein polypeptide. The mutations in the Omicron variant spike protein are distributed both on the surface and the interior of the spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the mutations in the RBD are predominantly distributed on one face of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which spans regions that bind ACE2 as well as those that form epitopes for numerous broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">The Omicron variant shares RBD mutations in common with previous variants of concern (K417N, T478K, and N501Y). The N501Y and K417N mutations have been extensively individually characterized for their effect on ACE2 binding, and exhibit increased and decreased ACE2 binding affinity respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These mutational effects have been demonstrated to act in a modular fashion, preserving the same general impact on ACE2 affinity when present in isolation or in combination with other RBD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, the Omicron RBD contains 12 additional mutations which have not yet been characterized in depth for their effect on ACE2 binding affinity, making it difficult to predict the overall change in ACE2 affinity for the Omicron variant. To measure the potential impact of Omicron mutations on the ACE2 binding affinity of its spike protein, we performed surface plasmon resonance studies and compared the resulting binding affinities (KD) to wild-type and Delta spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Wild-type (WT) is used in this work to refer to the ancestral Wuhan-1 strain with the addition of the D614G mutation. While the Omicron spike protein exhibits a measurable increase in affinity for ACE2 relative to the ancestral Wuhan strain (in agreement with a recent preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)), the ACE2 affinity is similar for Delta and Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The Omicron variant includes the K417N mutation that is known to reduce ACE2 binding significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The absence of a decrease in overall ACE2 binding affinity for the Omicron spike protein suggests there are likely compensatory mutations that restore higher affinity for ACE2, which should be possible to visualize in a high-resolution structure of the complex between the spike protein and ACE2.</p>
<p id="P6">Cryo-EM structural analysis of the ACE2-Omicron spike protein complex shows strong density for ACE2 bound to the RBD of one of the protomers in the “up” position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Weaker density is observed for a second bound ACE2, suggesting partial occupancy of the second RBD under the conditions of our experiment. The stoichiometry of ACE2 binding can be variable depending on the experimental conditions; in this analysis we have concentrated on the structure of the ACE2-spike protein interface in the most strongly bound ACE2 molecule. Focused refinement of the RBD-ACE2 region resulted in a density map with a resolution of 2.66 Å at the spike protein-ACE2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), allowing visualization of sidechains involved in the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, we compare the key interactions at this interface in the Omicron variant with corresponding interactions that we have reported recently for the Delta variant ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), accepted at Nature Communications). In the Delta variant-ACE2 complex, there are hydrogen bonds formed by residues Q493 and Q498 on the spike protein with residues E35 and Q42, respectively, on ACE2. In the Omicron variant, three mutations are observed in this stretch: Q493R, G396S and Q498R. Residue R493 replaces the hydrogen bond to ACE2 residue E35 with a new salt bridge, while residue R498 forms a new salt bridge with ACE2 residue D38 in addition to maintaining a hydrogen bonded interaction between residue 498 and ACE2 residue Q42. RBD residue S496 adds a new interaction at the interface by forming a hydrogen bond with ACE2 residue K353.</p>
<p id="P7">While these new interactions formed by residues 493, 496 and 498 likely make spike-ACE2 binding stronger, this is offset by the loss of a key salt bridge between spike protein residue K417 and ACE2 residue D30 that is present in the Delta variant. In isolation, the K417N mutant displays reduced ACE2 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), but our findings suggest that the new mutations in the Omicron interface have a compensatory effect on the strength of ACE2 binding, providing an explanation for the similar ACE2 binding affinities observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">We next investigated the effects of Omicron mutations on neutralization by (i) a selection of monoclonal antibodies, (ii) sera obtained from 30 doubly vaccinated individuals with no prior history of COVID-19 infection and (iii) sera obtained from a set of 68 unvaccinated convalescent patients who recovered from infection by either Alpha, Gamma or Delta variants (summary of patient demographics is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). We performed neutralization experiments using pseudovirions that incorporate the wild-type, Delta, or Omicron variant S proteins and compared the resulting antibody evasion of viral entry. The comparison to evasion relative to the Delta variant is likely the most important and relevant given that the Omicron variant is rapidly supplanting the Delta variant in global prevalence, though comparison to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 is still relevant given the majority of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogens are based on this sequence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We used a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that include RBD-directed antibodies (ab1, ab8, S309, S2M11;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)) and two N-terminal domain (NTD)-directed antibodies (4-8 and 4A8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>)) to investigate the impact of Omicron RBD and NTD mutations on monoclonal antibody escape. In contrast to the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, Epsilon, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, the Omicron variant exhibited measurable evasion from every antibody in this panel with complete escape from five of the six antibodies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The neutralizing activity of both the NTD-directed antibodies (4-8 and 4A8) is completely knocked out for the Omicron variant, as seen previously in the Alpha variant which contains identical or similar deletions in its NTD (Δ69-70 and Δ144-145). The Omicron variant does not show complete escape from S309, an antibody undergoing evaluation in clinical trials to treat patients with COVID-19 although there is still a 4-fold decrease in its neutralization potency relative to the ancestral strain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The unusually high number of mutations in the Omicron variant spike protein thus appear to confer unprecedently broad antibody escape relative to previously emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Sera from convalescent patients displayed on average a 6.3x decrease in ability to neutralize the Omicron variant relative to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> upper panel). Sera from the vaccinated cohort also displayed reduced neutralization ability (4.4x decrease) with a wider variation driven by some individuals that showed exceptional loss of neutralization ability to Omicron. The comparison of change in neutralization potential between Delta and Omicron variants is a more relevant comparison given the world-wide dominance of Delta. Sera from convalescent patients shows an even greater drop in neutralization potency relative to the Delta variant (8.2x decrease) while the vaccinated group also shows reduction in potency, although to a lesser extent (3.4x decrease). We note that the majority of the doubly vaccinated cohort consisted of individuals who were vaccinated with a schedule of at least 8 weeks between doses, recently shown to generate a better humoral response than the manufacturer-recommended interval of 3-4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The longer interval between doses could result in less pronounced reduction in neutralization of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p id="P11">A finer analysis of the unvaccinated convalescent cohort stratified into those who recovered from infection by either Delta, Alpha, or Gamma variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>) reinforces the reduction in neutralization potency against the Omicron variant in all populations, with especially striking drops for patients who recovered from infection from the earlier Alpha and Gamma variants. The findings we report here are consistent with several other recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) that the Omicron variant is more resistant to neutralization than any other variant of concern that has emerged over the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p id="P12">The mechanisms underlying the rapid spread of the newly emerged Omicron variant are of fundamental interest given the likelihood that this virus could become the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2. The large number of mutations on the surface of the spike protein including the immunodominant RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) would be expected to help the virus evade from antibodies elicited by vaccination or prior infection. However, it is remarkable that the Omicron variant evolved to retain its ability to bind ACE2 efficiently despite these extensive mutations. The cryo-EM structure of the spike protein-ACE2 complex provides a structural rationale for how this is achieved: interactions involving the new mutations in the Omicron variant at residues 493, 496 and 498 appear to restore ACE2 binding efficiency that would be lost due to other mutations such as K417N. The Omicron variant thus appears to have evolved to selectively balance two critical features, namely the increase in escape from neutralization but without compromising its ability to interact efficiently with ACE2. The increase in antibody evasion and the retention of strong interactions at the ACE2 interface are thus likely to represent key molecular features that contribute to the increase in transmissibility of the Omicron variant.</p>

<title>SPR analysis of the wild-type, Delta, and Omicron spike protein affinities for ACE2.</title>
<p>
<bold>(A-C)</bold> Representative curves of single-cycle kinetic analyses of S protein – ACE2 binding. Red curves show the fitting to the raw data (shown in black) using a 1:1 binding model. 6.25, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 nM of each spike protein was injected in successive cycles. (RU: Response units). <bold>(D)</bold> Quantitation of dissociation constants (KD) for the wild-type, Delta, and Omicron S protein – ACE2 interaction. The standard deviation of at least three replicates is shown. Horizontal dotted lines are plotted for the K417N and N501Y + E484K individually mutated S proteins to demonstrate the range of this assay (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S2</xref> for binding data). A Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed on the wild-type, Delta, and Omicron binding affinities (*P&lt;0.05, ns = not significant).</p>

<bold>(A)</bold> Cryo-EM map of the Omicron spike protein in complex with human ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution after global refinement. The three protomers are colored in shades of purple and the density for bound ACE2 proteins is coloured in blue. <bold>(B)</bold> Cryo-EM map of the Omicron spike RBD in complex with ACE2 at 2.66 Å resolution after focused refinement. The inset box indicates the region highlighted in (C). <bold>(C)</bold> Cryo-EM density at the Omicron spike RBD-ACE2 interface, with fitted atomic model. Yellow dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds. <bold>(D-E)</bold> Comparison of the RBD-ACE2 interface between the Omicron (upper) and Delta (lower) variants. Compared to the Delta variant, new interactions are formed as a result of the mutations Q493R, G496S and Q498R (D), and the salt bridge between RBD K417 and ACE2 D30 is lost (E) in the Omicron variant. Yellow and red dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions respectively.</p>
