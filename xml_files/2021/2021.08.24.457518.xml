Vaccine candidates relying on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been the focus of our development program. In this paper, we report on the generation of the RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein that when formulated with alum and the TLR-9 agonist, CpG1826 elicits a robust immune response and protection in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Method</title><p id="P2">The RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> X33. After fermentation at the 5 L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results, Conclusions, and Significance</title><p id="P3">The RBD203-N1 production process yielded 492.9 ± 3.0 mg/L of protein in the fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a &gt;96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 ± 3% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 ± 13.2 mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized as a homogeneous monomer with well-defined secondary structure, thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on alum and CpG, it was immunogenic and induced robust levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These characteristics show that this vaccine candidate is well suited for technology transfer with feasibility of its transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd><italic>P. pastoris,</italic></kwd><kwd>biophysical characterization</kwd><kwd>subunit vaccine</kwd><kwd>neutralization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>COVID-19</term><def><p id="P4">Coronavirus disease 2019;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARS</term><def><p id="P5">severe acute respiratory syndrome;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CoV</term><def><p id="P6">coronavirus;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S</term><def><p id="P7">spike;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBD</term><def><p id="P8">receptor-binding domain;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DO</term><def><p id="P9">dissolved oxygen;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FS</term><def><p id="P10">fermentation supernatant;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p id="P11">column volume;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>%CV</term><def><p id="P12">coefficient of variation;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLS</term><def><p id="P13">dynamic light scattering;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD</term><def><p id="P14">circular dichroism;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACE-2</term><def><p id="P15">angiotensin-converting enzyme 2;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AEX</term><def><p id="P16">anion exchange chromatography;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIC</term><def><p id="P17">hydrophobic interaction chromatography;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>i.m.</term><def><p id="P18">intramuscular;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE-HPLC</term><def><p id="P19">size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CpG</term><def><p id="P20">CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mAB</term><def><p id="P21">monoclonal antibody;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR</term><def><p id="P22">toll-like receptor;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIBSC</term><def><p id="P23">National Institute for Biological Standards and Control</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P24">As of August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021, close to 5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in over 180 countries. However, this impressive vaccination campaign has still left over 70% of the global population without access to efficient protection from COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. According to a recent analysis, people in the highest-income countries are getting vaccinated more than 20 times faster than those living in poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Therefore, there remains an urgent need to add additional safe and effective vaccines to the global inventory and to produce these vaccines at the lowest cost possible when it comes to production, storage, and distribution.</p><p id="P25">Recombinant protein expression in yeast is a low-cost and therefore attractive platform of production as compared to other more costly production systems for biologics such as mammalian cell culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].

The Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium, for example, showed recently that a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain antigen was just as well folded and stable when made in yeast as when it was produced in mammalian cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].

To reduce hyperglycosylation, aggregation, improve stability and enable better controlled scalable and reproducible process development, we removed one of the main glycosylation sites (N331) from the RBD and mutated a C-terminal cysteine residue (C538A). The resulting protein, RBD219-N1C1, was shown to maintain its ability to effectively trigger a robust immune response with a high level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Here we report on the design, construction, and biophysical, biochemical, and immunological evaluation of a new construct, RBD203-N1 (residues 332-533), where we deleted the SARS CoV-2 RBD residues 534-549, including the cysteine residue at position 538.

N1 designates the exclusion of N331, a putative N-glycosylation site, from the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To evaluate the reproducibility of the production process, two identical 5L scale production runs were performed. During production, the yield and the recovery were monitored (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The results indicated a fermentation yield for RBD203-N1 of 492.9 ± 3.0 mg/L of fermentation supernatant (FS) with an overall recovery of 55 ± 3% after purification. When evaluating the coefficient of variation of the process, one could notice that the %CV was lower than 6% throughout the process, indicating that the process was reproducible. Purity analysis of the in-process samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) revealed that the downstream process efficiently improved the purity from 61.8 ± 1.1% to 97.0 ± 0.4% under reduced conditions, or from 75.0 ± 0.6% to 96.4 ± 0.9% under non-reduced conditions. SE-HPLC data also revealed the purity of RBD203-N1 was approximately 99.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Overall, the binding profile of the antibodies to RBD203-N1 and RBD219-N1C1 was similar. Neutralizing antibodies (mAbs 1128, 643, and 486) likely recognized conformational epitopes and thus did not recognize reduced RBDs well. mAbs 854 and 942 recognized both non-reduced and reduced RBD equally, while mAbs 748 and 102 recognized the reduced RBDs stronger than the reduced RBDs. Although 203 dimer was not detectable in SDS-PAGE, SE-HPLC, these monoclonal antibodies all recognized the RBD203 dimer form. Interestingly, mAb486 only recognized the RBD dimer but not the monomer, suggesting that the dimer form might have better preserved the conformation for antibody recognition.</p><p id="P46">Similar to the western blot, ELISAs were performed using the same monoclonal panel against RBD203-N1 and RBD219-N1C1, respectively.

The antigen, RBD203-N1, was expressed effectively in the yeast <italic>P. pastoris,</italic> and purified by a combination of hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The fermentation yield using a process that we have previous developed for a similar vaccine antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], was determined as 492.9 ± 3.0 mg/L RBD203-N1 of FS. The overall recovery from this two-step purification scheme for RBD203-N1 was determined as 55 ± 3%. The production process was demonstrated to be reproducible with less than 6% of %CV throughout the process between two identical production runs. RBD203-N1 was shown to be a protein of high purity when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (&gt;96%) and SE-HPLC (&gt;99%). DLS also indicated that the purified protein was monodispersed. When we inspected the molecular weight of the deglycosylated RBD203-N1 by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary method</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), we discovered two major RBD203-N1 species with additional EAEAEF or EAEF amino acid residues at the N-terminus.

The adjacent EF residues are derived from the translation of the EcoRI used for cloning of the RBD sequence in pPiczα.

One exception was mAb486 that only recognized the dimer form of RBD203-N1 in the western blot, which suggested that the dimer form might have preserved the confirmation better. When assessing the secondary structures, far-UV CD spectra indicated that RBD203-N1 and RBD219-N1C1 proteins had similar secondary structures and the melting temperatures evaluated by CD further revealed that the thermal stability for the secondary structure of both proteins was comparable. Additionally, thermal shift assays also indicated that both RBDs shared comparable thermal stability for their tertiary structures. Moreover, the in vitro functionality assay further confirmed a similar binding affinity to ACE-2 to these RBDs, suggesting that these two RBDs shared the same biophysical and biochemical characteristics.</p><p id="P54">The immunogenicity in mice of RBD203-N1, when formulated with alum with or without the TLR9 agonist CpG, was evaluated. The addition of CpG to COVID-19 vaccine formulations has been demonstrated to promote antigen dose sparing as well as the induction of balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses with much lower intra-cohort variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. When adjuvanted with CpG, the use of 7ug and 2.3ug of RBD203-N1 protein elicited robust neutralizing antibody titers that were protective against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles. The level of neutralizing antibodies in the serum was 2.5-times higher than the NIBSC standard plasma and was also equivalent to the control RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The use of low RBD protein concentration, when formulated with alum alone and in a two-dose regime, did not trigger robust antigen-specific antibody titers and the neutralizing activity was undetectable. However, our studies with RBD/alum formulations in two- or three-dose regimens using higher protein doses have been shown to trigger robust immune responses with high neutralizing titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In addition, Nanogen, recently showed that their Nanocovax vaccine, consisting of a recombinant S protein formulated with alum was immunogenic and efficacious in various animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Therefore, RBD proteins, including RBD203-N1, adjuvanted with alum alone should continue to be evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy especially in the context of the changing SARS CoV-2 virus epidemiology.</p></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P55">In this study, we report on RBD203-N1, a truncated version of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein RBD. The fermentation yield of this construct was 493 mg/L of FS. The two-step purification process allowed for a recovery of more than 50% of RBD203-N1. The purified RBD203-N1 was of high purity (&gt;96% by SDS-PAGE and &gt;99% by SE-HPLC). When studying the biophysical and biochemical characteristics, we confirmed this truncated protein retained the expected secondary structure, thermal stability, antigenicity, and functionality. Additionally, when formulated with alum+CpG, it triggered a robust level of antigen-specific antibodies that possess neutralizing ability, as well as a desired balanced cytokine profile.
