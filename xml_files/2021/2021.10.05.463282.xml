<abstract>
<p id="P2">Robust severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nasal turbinate (NT) accounts for high viral transmissibility, yet whether neutralizing IgA antibodies can control it remains unknown. Here, we evaluated receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2, and dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 against intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. These antibodies exhibited comparably potent neutralization against authentic virus by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for RBD binding. While reducing viruses in lungs, pre-exposure intranasal B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 led to 81-fold more infectious viruses and severer damage in NT than placebo. Virus-bound B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could engage CD209 as an alternative receptor for entry into ACE2-negative cells and allowed viral cell-to-cell transmission. Cryo-EM revealed B8 as a class II neutralizing antibody binding trimeric RBDs in 3-up or 2-up/1-down conformation. Therefore, RBD-specific neutralizing dIgA engages an unexpected action for enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury in Syrian hamsters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, is the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its surface trimeric spike (S) protein to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. After the ACE2 binding, the S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by host cellular proteases including the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to promote fusion of viral and cellular membranes for viral entry <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Apparently, these entry processes are similar to those of SARS-CoV-1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, the causative agent of SARS, although these two coronaviruses share just 76% and 40% amino acid identity between their genomes and their RBD external subdomains, respectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2, however, has displayed remarkably higher transmissibility than SARS-CoV-1. By August 2021, the rapid all-year-round transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 200 million infections and 4 million deaths globally <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> since the outbreak of COVID-19 reported in December 2019. This is in marked contrast to the SARS epidemic, which caused only 8096 cases and 774 deaths, and disappeared in 2003 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for pandemic control.</p>
<p id="P4">The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is likely associated with multiple factors. First, unlike SARS-CoV-1-infected cases characterized by high fever and prominent respiratory symptoms, afebrile individuals with SARS-CoV-2 were often found upon diagnosis, allowing person-to-person transmissions by asymptomatic carriers including international travellers <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Second, while both coronaviruses employ the same receptor ACE2, highly conserved RBD residues or side chain properties of SARS-CoV-2 might account for increased ACE2 binding <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Third, the unique insertion of the PRRA sequence in SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein promotes higher virion infectivity and cell-cell fusion, leading to enhanced pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Fourth, by altering the S protein conformation, the D614G mutation increases the stability of S trimer to avoid premature S1 shedding, which results in a rapid dominance of this mutation globally <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. The D614G mutation also induces higher infectious titres in nasal washes and the trachea of infected hamsters <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Multiple mechanisms, therefore, contribute to the high upper respiratory tract (URT) viral loads characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, which facilitates viral transmission in the human population. Till now, the role of nasal IgA remains understudied. In particular, whether antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection has any place <italic>in vivo</italic> remains an open question <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, worldwide research efforts have led to the identification of many potent human neutralizing antibodies (HuNAbs) mainly in IgG form for preclinical and clinical developments <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Some studies also investigated IgA antibodies, which are known to play an important role in mucosal immunity, especially in their secretory form (SIgA) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. RBD-specific IgA antibodies were rapidly discovered in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. IgA and SIgA were even shown to dominate the early antibody response as compared to IgG and IgM in saliva and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids due to expansion of IgA plasmablasts with mucosal homing characteristics <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. However, it was noted that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had higher SIgA in the airway mucosa for unknown reasons <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, a recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were closely associated with spike-specific IgA responses in the nasal samples of acute COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Since dIgA were shown to be about 15 times more potent than mIgA <italic>in vitro</italic> against the same target, dIgA were suggested to be particularly valuable for therapeutic application against SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. It is essential to investigate the potential of mIgA and dIgA in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we used the technology of single B cell antibody gene cloning to generate a panel of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific monoclonal HuNAbs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of one acute and three convalescent COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. Since intramuscular or intranasal inoculation of several potent IgG HuNAbs cannot completely prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal turbinate (NT) of Syrian hamsters <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>, we sought to improve the efficacy of HuNAb by converting IgG to IgA. To achieve this goal, we engineered the potent B8-IgG1 into monomeric IgA1 (B8-mIgA1), monomeric IgA2 (B8-mIgA2), dimeric (B8-dIgA1) and dimeric IgA2 (B8-dIgA2), and determined their efficacies in the Syrian hamster model against the live intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge <sup>

<title>Characterization of human monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients</title>
<p id="P7">To isolate human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), we obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one acute (P4) and three convalescent (P1-P3) COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong at a mean 73.5 (Â±25) days after symptoms onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and pseudovirus neutralization assays revealed that all patient sera showed SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and spike-specific binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The mean NAb IC<sub>50</sub> titer was 1:1753 with a range of 1:638-1:5701. Flow cytometry was then used to sort SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin positive (IgG<sup>+</sup>) memory B cells from individual PBMC samples using two fluorescent-conjugated RBD probes. The percentage of RBD-binding IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells ranged from 0.19% to 0.52% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). We successfully cloned a total of 34 MAbs from these patients, including 3 from P1, 8 from P2, 17 from P3 and 6 from P4. We confirmed that 18 of these MAbs exhibited RBD-specific binding activities detected by ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). No clear dominance of heavy (H) chain gene family was found among these 4 subjects by sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, left panels). VLK1, however, was the most used variable gene family for the light (L) chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, right panels). The average somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate ranged from 0% to 12.2% for the H chain and from 0.7% to 7.9% for the L chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, left). The average complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) lengths ranged from 12.3 to 17.4 for the H chain and 8.4 to 9.4 for the L chain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, right). These results suggested overall comparable degrees of affinity maturation in these RBD-specific human MAbs obtained from individual memory B cells of four Hong Kong patients.</p>

<title>Specificity and potency of SARS-CoV-2-specific human neutralizing antibodies</title>
<p id="P8">To determine the antiviral activities of these 18 RBD-specific human MAbs, we performed binding and neutralization assays. Five of them, namely A6-IgG1, B4-IgG1, B7-IgG1, B8-IgG1 and C5-IgG1 displayed RBD- and spike- specific binding by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) and neutralizing activities against both pseudotyped and authentic viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the four most potent HuNAbs, B4-IgG1, B7-IgG1, B8-IgG1 and C5-IgG1, all came from patient P3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed strong similarities between B7-, B8-, and C5-IgG1, which all contained an IGHV1-69 heavy chain gene and an IGKV3 kappa light chain gene. B4-IgG1 contained distinct IGHV3-66 and IGKV1-33 genes with CDR3 lengths of 12 amino acids (aa) and 9 aa, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate of 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). B7 and B8 were the most similar, as both contained IGHV1-69 and IGKV3-11 though B8 had a shorter CDR3 (14 aa vs 18 aa) and higher SHM (4.8% vs 0.0%) than those of B7 in the heavy chain. In the L chain, B7 and B8 shared a 9 aa CDR3, but B8 had a higher SHM rate than that of B7 (1.7% vs 0.7%) C5-IgG1 had a similar IGHV1-69 light chain gene with a 16 aa CDR3 and 2.4% SHM, but a different IGKV3-20 with a 9 aa CDR3 and 2.8% SHM. By ELISA, these four P3-derived HuNAbs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 Î¼g/ml, indicating stronger binding than that of the P4-derived A6-IgG1 (0.3 Î¼g/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). P3-derived MAbs also exhibited stronger binding activities to the spike, with the EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.018 to 0.06 Î¼g/ml, compared to A6-IgG1 (17.94 Î¼g/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Neutralizing assays using pseudoviruses revealed that these four potent HuNAbs had IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.0095 to 0.038 Î¼g/ml, and IC<sub>90</sub> values ranging from 0.046 to 0.136 Î¼g/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Moreover, B8 proved to be the most potent HuNAb, capable of inhibiting authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.013 Î¼g/ml and an IC<sub>90</sub> value of 0.032 Î¼g/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). We then determined if these HuNAbs could compete with ACE2 for RBD binding by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We found that all of them strongly competed with ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). In line with the ELISA results, B8-IgG1 displayed the best KD value for RBD binding (169 pM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 5</xref>) and the strongest competition with ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), which explained its potent neutralizing activity. As B4-IgG1 displayed only partial competition for RBD binding with the other antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>), we further performed antibody synergy experiments using the pseudotype neuralization assay. No significant synergistic effects were found between any pairs of these four HuNAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). These results demonstrated that B4-, B7-, B8- and C5-IgG1 were all RBD-specific and competed with ACE2 for similar sites on the RBD.</p>

<title>B8-IgG1 pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment in the golden Syrian hamster model</title>
<p id="P9">To determine the efficiency of B8-IgG1 in pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment against live intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection, we administered B8-IgG1 intraperitoneally in golden Syrian hamsters, before or after viral challenge in our Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) animal laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the pre-exposure prophylaxis group (G1, n = 4), each hamster received a single intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg B8-IgG1. In the post-exposure treatment groups, each hamster received a single intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg B8-IgG1 at day 1 (G2, n = 4), day 2 (G3, n = 4) or day 3 (G4, n = 4) postinfection (dpi), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The challenge dose was 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of live SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a strain) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. Another group of hamsters (G0, n = 4) received PBS injection as a no-treatment control. One G4 animal died accidentally during the procedure. Since Syrian hamsters recover quickly from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with resolution of clinical signs and clearance of virus shedding within one week after infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>, we chose to sacrifice the animals at 4 dpi for HuNAb efficacy analysis, at a time when high viral loads and acute lung injury were consistently observed. At 4 dpi, NT and lung tissues were harvested to quantify infectious viruses by measuring PFUs, viral RNA loads by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and infected cells by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP)-positive cells as we described previously <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">We found that infectious virus, measured by PFU, weas readily detected in all tissue compartments of G0 hamsters but not in the lungs of 75% G1, 100% G2, 75% G3 and 0% G4 animals, nor in the NT of 50% G1, 75% G2, 50% G3 and 25% G4 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2E</xref>). The decrease in PFU was of 2-3 orders of magnitude, suggesting efficient viral suppression in the lungs for the G1, G2, and G3 groups. A sensitive RT-PCR assay further demonstrated that viral RNA copy numbers were decreased in the lungs by 3 orders of magnitude in 50% of G1 hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant viral RNA reduction in the NT of G1 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), suggesting lower efficacy of B8-IgG1 to prevent viral entry in the URT than in the lungs. There were slight but not significant viral RNA load decreases in both lungs and NT of G2 and some G3 animals. We then evaluated the number of infected cells or foci in these two tissue compartments by anti-NP antibody staining. A clear decrease of NP-positive cells or foci was observed in the lungs of G1 and G2 hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Abundant NP-positive cells with a diffuse distribution, however, were readily detected in the NT of all the challenged hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results demonstrated that systemic B8-IgG1 injection was effective at reducing productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment especially within 48 hours post infection, but was insufficient to prevent viral infection in the NT.</p>
<p id="P11">To determine the correlates of B8-IgG1-mediated protection, we also measured the antibody concentration in serum, lung homogenate and NT homogenates at 0 and 4 dpi for all experimental animals. On average, 4,257 ng/ml and 2,101 ng/ml B8-IgG1 were found in animal sera at 0 and 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). On 4 dpi, lung and NT homogenates contained 128 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml in G1, 238 ng/ml and 86 ng/ml in G2, 229 ng/ml and 93 ng/ml in G3, and 192 ng/ml and 46 ng/ml in G4 animals, respectively. These results demonstrated that most animals maintained higher peripheral B8-IgG1 antibody concentration, while a decreasing concentration gradient was observed in the lungs and NT during infection. The concentrations of B8-IgG1 measured in NT homogenates were close to the neutralization IC<sub>90</sub> measured <italic>in vitro</italic> (32 ng/ml), explaining why infectious virus was undetectable in the PFU assay. These findings are in line with results obtained for other potent IgG HuNAbs administered systemically, as reported in our previous study <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. The B8-IgG1 concentrations measured in the NT appeared insufficient to completely block infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, as indicated by the presence of NP-positive cells scattered throughout the NT.</p>

<title>Pre-exposure prophylaxis by monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2 in Syrian hamsters</title>
<p id="P12">Since systemic administration of the RBD-specific neutralizing B8-IgG1 did not suppress SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection effectively, we sought to construct various types of IgA for mucosal intervention. For this purpose, we engineered B8-IgG1 into monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2, and then into dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 by introducing the J chain. By <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization, purified B8-mIgA1, B8-mIgA2, B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 retained similar binding to RBD and spike by ELISA as compared to B8-IgG1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A-B, Supplementary Table 7</xref>), and comparable antiviral activities based on neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>90</sub> values ((<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3C-D and Supplementary Table 8</xref>). That said, B8-mIgA2 and B8-dIgA2 showed slightly more potent IC<sub>90</sub> activities than B8-IgG1 in the pseudovirus neutralization assay using 293T-ACE2 cells as targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). After introducing J chain, the proper dimer formation of B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3E-F</xref>). Furthermore, B8-mIgA1, B8-mIgA2, B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 also retained comparable competition with ACE2 for binding to spike by SPR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3G-J</xref>). Therefore, the engineered IgA had the expected structural properties, and showed antiviral activities as potent as those of B8-IgG1 <italic>in vitro.</italic>
</p>
<p id="P13">We then evaluated the monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2 in the hamster model, using a higher 4.5 mg/kg dose via either intranasal or intraperitoneal injection, and used the same amount of intranasal B8-IgG1 inoculation as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A to 3I</xref>). Interestingly, while changes in total RdRp and subgenomic sgNP viral RNA loads were not obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D to 3E</xref>), B8-IgG1 and B8-mIgA1 (both <italic>i.n.</italic> and <italic>i.p.</italic>), but not B8-mIgA2, were able to significantly suppress infectious virus production (PFU) in the lungs of 75% infected hamsters by 2 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Sporadic infected cell foci were still detected in the lung sections by anti-NP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that protection conferred by B8-IgG1 and B8-mIgA1 was not complete. B8-mIgA2 was not able to suppress viral RNA load nor PFU in the challenged hamsters, regardless of the route of antibody injection. On the other hand, like B8-IgG1, both B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2 did not achieve significant viral suppression in the NT. After intranasal administration of either B8-mIgA1 or B8-mIgA2, some hamsters even showed a trend of slightly increased infectious virus production in NT, though this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-3H</xref>). Among these animals, the NP-positive cells were detected readily in the NT, as demonstrated by the whole section scanning, indicating the comparable distribution compared with the B8-IgG1 and no-treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). These results were consistent with many NP-positive cells observed in diffusely infected areas of NT by classic IF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). These results demonstrated that B8-mIgA1 was more potent than B8-mIgA2 at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs, but that both mIgA did not prevent nor significantly limit SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection.</p>

<title>B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 mediate enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury in Syrian hamsters</title>
<p id="P14">Next, we tested the effects of dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 in Syrian hamsters. To improve protective efficacy of intranasal dIgA treatment, we included a 3-fold higher dosage group of 13.5 mg/kg besides the 4.5 mg/kg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A to 4I</xref>), and we shortened the interval between dIgA and virus inoculation to 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Both RdRp and sgNP viral RNA loads dropped significantly in the lungs of hamsters that received the high dose of B8-dIgA2 compared to the no-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B and 4C</xref>). Both B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 at the high dose also suppressed infectious viruses (PFU) in the lungs of 75% and 100% treated hamsters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). High dose B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 also decreased the number of NP-positive cells or foci in the lungs, with a more marked change for B8-dIgA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, we observed significantly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and tissue damage in most infected hamsters included the low and high dose groups of both B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2, in all the four assays used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F to 4I</xref>). High dose administration of B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 resulted in increased PFU production in the NT by 37-fold and 81-fold, respectively, compared to the no-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Since our model showed comparable NT PFU on day 2 and day 4 as described previously <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>, this level of enhanced infection was unusual. It was also not observed with B8-IgG1 or monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2 treatment, as described above. Moreover, the distribution of NP-positive cells in hamsters treated with dimeric B8-IgA was broader and reached deeper into NT tissue compared to the no-treatment group, as shown by whole section scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>), which was associated with more severe and extensive epithelium desquamation and luminal cell debris (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>). The density of nasal NP<sup>+</sup> cells was also significantly higher in B8-dIgA2-treated hamsters than in PBS-treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D-E</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that treatment with dimeric B8-IgA expanded the type and distribution of target cells in the nasal epithelium. Critically, we confirmed that control dimeric dIgA1 and dIgA2 did not enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These results demonstrated that, instead of inducing viral suppression, pre-exposure dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury significantly in Syrian hamsters, which was consistently found in three independent experiments.</p>
<p id="P15">To validate the role of B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2, we then measured B8-IgA concentrations in the serum at day 0 and 4 dpi, and in the lung and NT homogenates at 4 dpi. B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 were primarily detected in lung homogenates at 4 dpi and were apparently undetectable in the serum and NT homogenates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). The enhanced viral replication in NT probably exhausted B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 locally, through antibody-virus complex formation and clearance <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. To address this possibility, we treated separately five groups of naÃ¯ve Syrian hamsters (n=4 per group) with each antibody at the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Twelve hours after the inoculation, antibody concentrations were readily detected in each tissues compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). The highest concentrations of dIgA antibodies were found in lung homogenates, followed by nasal washes, NT homogenates, and serum. These results suggest that B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 concentrations in the NT and lungs were still above their neutralization IC<sub>90</sub> values at the time of viral challenge, indicating that the results obtained in our experiments could not be explained by the insufficient amounts of antibodies.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>B8-dIgA1- and B8-dIgA2-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection via CD209</title>
<p id="P16">Since B8 antibodies share the same binding site to the RBD domain, we sought to investigate possible mechanisms of B8-dIgA1- and B8-dIgA2-enhanced infection. First, we consistently found that 10 ng/ml B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 completely neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection in human renal proximal tubule cells (HK-2), as measured in our previously reported immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. We also tested B8-mIgA2 and B8-dIgA2 neutralizing capacity in the MucilAirâ¢ model, consisting of a reconstructed human nasal epithelium, which contained goblet, ciliated, and basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>. Both B8-mIgA2 and B8-dIgA2 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent fashion, when compared to a dIgA2 control antibody. Similar experiments were carried out in the presence of the mucus naturally secreted by goblet cells, to determine whether dIgA interaction with the mucus may alter their neutralization capacity. However, B8-dIgA2 showed the same neutralization capacity in the presence and absence of mucus. These results demonstrated that B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 did not enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection in either human HK-2 or primary airway epithelial cells, which primarily expressed human ACE2 as a viral receptor. We then turned our attention to ACE2-independent mechanisms that might be associated with dimeric IgA-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering that mucosal monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) could mediate SARS-CoV-1 infection and dissemination in rhesus monkeys as early as 2 dpi, as we previously reported <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>, we sought to investigate the role of DC-expressed surface receptors. We focused on CD209 (DC-SIGN), because this lectin was previously shown to act as a cellular receptor for secretory IgA <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. By IF staining, intranasal administration of B8-dIgA2 alone did not increase CD209 expression in the NT of treated hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, left). Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, we noted an increase in CD209-positive cells in olfactory epithelium devoid of ACE2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, middle). Importantly, most CD209<sup>+</sup> cells were positive for NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, right), indicating that these CD209<sup>+</sup> cells were likely permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then determined whether B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection in 293T cells expressing human CD209 or CD299 but not ACE2. Using a low MOI of 0.05, we found that pre-incubation of B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 enhanced live SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly in 293T cells expressing human CD209, as determined by increased viral NP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Interestingly, human CD299, a type II integral membrane protein that is 77% identical to CD209, did not show similar activities in the same experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Control dIgA1 and dIgA2 did not show any enhancement in NP<sup>+</sup> cell detection compared with virus only. Considering that CD209<sup>+</sup> DCs promote HIV-1 transmission to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via cell-cell contacts, we speculated that B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 might not be able to block the similar process for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, by testing the B8 antibodies at concentrations 100-times higher than IC<sub>90</sub> neutralization values (around 3000 ng/ml), none of B8-IgG1, B8-mIgA1, B8-mIgA2, B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could block cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrated that B8-dIgA1- and B8-dIgA2-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection likely involved viral capture and infection of mucosal CD209<sup>+</sup> cells, followed by more robust infection of ACE2<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells through trans-infection via cell-cell spread in NT.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM analysis of the spike-B8 complex</title>
<p id="P17">To understand the potential mechanism of action of B8 HuNAb, we performed a cryo-EM single-particle analysis of B8 Fab bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Two B8-spike complex structures were determined based on 351,095 and 616,799 particles collected, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). One structure at 2.67 Ã resolution contained the spike with all three RBDs adopting the âupâ conformation (3u), where each âupâ RBD was bound by one B8 Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>). The other structure at 2.65 Ã resolution contained one spike trimer with 2 RBDs in the âupâ conformation and 1 RBD in the âdownâ conformation (2u1d), where each RBD was also bound by one B8 Fab despite the presence of two distinct RBD conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). After superimposing the â3uâ and â2u1dâ spikes, a ~53-degree rotation was observed between the âupâ RBD (red color) in the 3u spike trimer and the âdownâ RBD (gray) in the 2u1d spike trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). The B8 Fab appeared to bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD through its heavy chain for most of the interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F-G</xref>). Therefore, the cellular receptor ACE2 would clash with the B8 Fab due to the overlap of their respective epitopes on the RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). The elucidation of the epitope revealed that B8 could be grouped into the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody class II <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. These structural findings were further supported by neutralization assays using a panel of pseudoviruses containing naturally occurring mutations. Indeed, the E484K mutation from the South African SA9 strain, which is located within the B8-binding interface, caused a major loss of neutralizing potency for all the B8 isotypes tested: IgG1, mIgA1, mIgA2, dIgA1 and dIgA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). The comparable neutralization profiles of these NAbs against the full panel of viral variants also indicated that the conformation of key RBD-binding residues remained unchanged after engineering of the constant regions of these B8 isotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">In this study, we investigated the preventive potential of a potent RBD-specific NAb B8 primarily in the forms of monomeric and dimeric IgA against live intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the golden Syrian hamster model as compared with B8-IgG1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. While these B8-IgA antibodies maintained neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> similar to those of B8-IgG1, they displayed distinct <italic>in vivo</italic> effects, with clear differences in their capacity to modulate viral infection in the NT. Pretreatment by intranasal administration of 4.5 mg/kg of monomeric B8-mIgA1 or B8-mIgA2 did not significantly reduce infectious virus production in the NT homogenates. On the contrary, the antibody isotype had a marked effect, as intranasal administration of 4.5 mg/kg and 13.5 mg/kg dimeric B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 paradoxically increased the amount of infectious virus (PFU) in NT homogenates. This enhancing effect was not observed with several intranasal IgG HuNAbs previously tested by other groups or our team <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Mechanistically, instead of neutralization, virus-bound B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 used CD209 as an alternative receptor to infect non-ACE2 cells. CD209<sup>+</sup> cells were increased and permissive to viral infection in the olfactory epithelium of Syrian hamsters upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that this cell population could contribute to viral mucosal seeding. Indeed, we found that CD209 expressing cells could be infected <italic>in vitro</italic> by live SARS-CoV-2 at 0.05 MOI in the presence of B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2. Since none of the B8-based MAbs could prevent SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission, even at high concentration <italic>in vitro</italic>, virus-laden mucosal CD209<sup>+</sup> cells might trans-infect ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells through cell-to-cell contacts in NT, resulting in enhanced infection and injury. Cryo-EM analysis further indicated that B8 is a typical class II HuNAb that binds to the SRAS-CoV-2 spike RBD in either a 3u or a 2u1d mode. Our findings, therefore, reveal a previously unrecognized pathway for RBD-specific dimeric IgA-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury in Syrian hamsters.</p>
<p id="P19">The role of dimeric IgA has been explored primarily for mucosal transmitted viruses. At the mucosal surface, the major IgA type is the secretory form, which is generated from dIgA by the acquisition of a secretory component upon endocytosis and secretion by epithelial cells. In the simian AIDS macaque model, neutralizing dIgA given directly into the rectal lumen can prevent viral acquisition in rhesus monkeys challenged via the mucosal route <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Although the administered dIgA did not contain the secretory component (SC), they might have associated with free SC, which is present in mucosal secretions such as human lung lavages <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. Neutralizing dIgA1 and dIgA2 could be protective through several mechanisms, including direct virus neutralization, virion capture, or the inhibition of virion transcytosis across the epithelium <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. In this macaque study, however, Watkins et al. demonstrated that the dimeric HGN194 dIgA2 protected only 1/6 animals in a rectal challenge model <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Recently, Taylor et al. found an increase in virion number and penetration depth in the transverse colon and mesenteric lymph nodes, after mucosal treatment with the HGN194 dIgA2 compared to a PBS control <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. The authors suggested that virus-specific dIgA somehow mediated the delivery of virus immune complexes to the mesenteric lymph nodes for systemic infection. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 may subvert the action of potent neutralizing antibodies, as pretreatment with neutralizing B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 induced a more robust nasal infection via a previously unrecognized mode of viral enhancement.</p>
<p id="P20">SARS-CoV-2 engages CD209<sup>+</sup> cells to evade ACE2-dependent neutralizing B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 for enhanced NT infection and injury. Previous studies have indicated various scenarios for ADE occurrence in viral infections. The well-known dengue ADE has been associated with poorly neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies against a heterologous viral serotype, leading to increased infection of FcÎ³R-expressing cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. Recent findings suggested that an increase in afucosylated antibodies contribute to dengue ADE <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease induced by respiratory syncytial virus has not been found to be antibody-dependent <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup>. For SARS and MERS, ADE observed <italic>in vitro</italic> depended on binding of the antibody Fab to the virus and the binding of the Fc component to FcÎ³R on target cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
</sup>. One study found that spike IgG antibody abrogated wound-healing responses in SARS-CoV-1-infected Chinese macaques <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>. In the case of COVID-19, vaccination and passive immunization studies have not revealed ADE of disease severity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. Comprehensive studies, however, are necessary to define the clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, especially in the context of vaccine breakthrough infections. During natural infection, one study indicated that the increase in afucosylated antibodies might contribute to COVID-19 severity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>. To date, four classes of potent HuNAbs have been isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. The molecular mechanism of neutralization for most potent HuNAbs was primarily through blocking the interaction between ACE2 and the spike RBD. Currently, systemic RBD-specific HuNAb treatment remains to be improved for therapeutic suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the NT or URT, both in animal models and human trials <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. One limitation is the insufficient amounts of HuNAbs distributed on the nasal mucosal surface for protection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Other reasons might include alternative entry pathways engaged by SARS-CoV-2 to evade HuNAbs. To this end, Liu et al. reported recently that antibodies against the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) induced an open conformation of the RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike to the ACE2 receptor, leading to increased viral infectivity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
</sup>. Yeung et al. demonstrated nicely that SARS-CoV-2 could engage soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and then bind alternate receptors for viral entry, through interaction between a spike/sACE2 complex with the angiotensin II AT1 receptor, or interaction between a spike/sACE2/vasopressin complex with the AVPR1B vasopressin receptor, respectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. In this study, we found that, in the presence of potent neutralizing B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 used the cellular receptor CD209 for capture or infection, which likely expanded the use of CD209<sup>+</sup> cells as target cells, leading to enhanced NT infection and trans-infection. Interestingly, a preprint report suggests that cells expressing CD209 can be infected directly by SARS-CoV-2 through an interaction of the spike with the NTD instead of the RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
</sup>. This mode of action, however, was unlikely to explain our findings, because no enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection was found in presence of control dIgA1 and dIgA2. Our results rather suggest that the direct binding of virus-bound B8-dIgA1 or virus-bound B8-dIgA2 to CD209 is a likely pathway, resulting in the more severe SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and damage. In line with our results, a previous study demonstrated that dIgA itself can use CD209 as a cellular receptor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. During the entry process, since neither B8-dIgA1 nor B8-dIgA2 could prevent virus cell-to-cell transmission, infected mucosal CD209<sup>+</sup> cells might enable a more robust viral transmission to ciliated nasal epithelial cells in NT, which show the highest expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. In support of this notion, previous studies indicated that mucosal DCs can capture HIV-1 through binding of its envelope glycoproteins to CD209 and efficiently transfer the bound virions to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in a process called trans-enhancement or trans-infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>
</sup>. The trans-infection markedly decreased the neutralization efficiency of potent NAbs directed at HIV <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, although monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) cannot support productive SARS-CoV-2 replication <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>
</sup>, a recent study demonstrated that MDDCs could mediate efficient viral trans-infection of the Calu-3 human respiratory cell line <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>
</sup>. Our findings of increased number of infectious viruses in NT, therefore, have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 pathogenesis, and immune interventions.</p>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p id="P21">As our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings were obtained in Syrian hamsters, it remains to be determined whether CD209<sup>+</sup> DCs are abundantly recruited to the nasal mucosa in SARS-CoV-2-infected humans. It is, however, known that myeloid DCs are increased in the nasal epithelium upon infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>
</sup>. Our preliminary analysis of the human nasal cytology data (under accession code EGAS00001004082) revealed the presence of increased CD209<sup>+</sup> DCs in addition to abundant ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin expression in the apical side of multiciliated cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected human subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>
</sup>. Another limitation is that we did not have an NTD-specific neutralizing dIgA for comparison. Besides the class II neutralizing dIgA such as B8-mIgA2 and B8-dIgA2 used in this study, neutralizing dIgA belonging to other classes should also be investigated in future. We also do not know whether other cellular receptor such as the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) plays a role in B8-dIgA-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection. The pIgR is responsible for transcytosis of soluble dIgAs and immune complexes from the basolateral to the apical epithelial surface. It remains uncertain whether B8-dIgA-enhanced NT infection would lead to worse neuro-COVID-19. Because current intramuscular vaccinations might not induce secretory dIgA at the nasal mucosal sites <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>
</sup>, it remains unknown whether the dIgA-mediated ADE would happen in people who received the COVID-19 vaccines or dIgA treatment. Future studies are needed to address these limitations.</p>

SPR assays were run at a flow rate of 30 mL/min in HEPES buffer. For conventional kinetic/dose-response, serial dilutions of monoclonal antibodies were injected across the spike protein surface for 180s, followed by a 600s dissociation phase using a multi-cycle method. Remaining analytes were removed in the surface regeneration step with the injection of 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) for 2Ã30s at a flow rate of 30 Î¼l/min. Kinetic analysis of each reference subtracted injection series was performed using the Biacore Insight Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare). All sensorgram series were fit to a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model of interaction. Before evaluating the competition between antibodies and the human ACE2 peptidase domain, both the saturating binding concentrations of antibodies and of the ACE2 protein (ACROBiosystems) for the immobilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined separately. In the competitive assay, antibodies at the saturating concentration were injected onto the chip with immobilized spike protein for 120s until binding steady-state was reached. ACE2 protein also used at the saturating concentration was then injected for 120s, followed by another 120s of injection of antibody to ensure a saturation of the binding reaction against the immobilized spike protein.

Further CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing improved the resolution to 2.65 Ã (2u1d, C1 symmetry) and 2.67 Ã (3u, C3 symmetry) with better map quality. To improve the RBD-B8 portion map density, focused local search classification was applied for each RBD-B8 portion with an adapted soft mask. The best classes for each RBD-Fab portion were selected and yielded a final resolution at 3.56 Ã (RBD-Fab1, up), 3.34 Ã (RBD-Fab2, up), 3.69 Ã (RBD-Fab3, down), 3.87 Ã (RBD-Fab3, up) from 479,305, 508,653, 656,429, and 136,482 particles, respectively. Further CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing improved the resolution of RBD-Fab2 to 3.11 Ã with better map quality. RBD-Fab maps were fitted onto the whole structure map using Chimera, then combined using PHENIX combine_focused_maps. The reported resolutions were estimated with the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) cutoff of 0.143 criterion.

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of reconstructed human nasal epithelia</title>
<p id="P38">MucilAirâ¢, corresponding to reconstructed human nasal epithelium cultures differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> for at least 4 weeks, were purchased from Epithelix (Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, France). The cultures were generated from pooled nasal tissues obtained from 14 human adult donors. Cultures were maintained in air/liquid interface (ALI) conditions in transwells with 700 Î¼L of MucilAirâ¢ medium (Epithelix) in the basal compartment, and then kept at 37 Â°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously described <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, the apical side of ALI cultures was washed 20 min at 37 Â°C in Mucilairâ¢ medium to remove mucus. Cells were then incubated with 10<sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of the isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF00372/2020 (EVAg collection, Ref-SKU: 014V-03890; kindly provided by S. Van der Werf). The viral input was diluted in DMEM medium to a final volume 100 Î¼L, and then left on the apical side for 4 h at 37 Â°C. Control wells were mock treated with DMEM medium (Gibco) for the same duration. Viral inputs were removed by washing twice with 200 Î¼L of PBS (5 min at 37 Â°C) and once with 200 Î¼L Mucilairâ¢ medium (20 min at 37 Â°C). The basal medium was replaced every 2-3 days. Apical supernatants were harvested every 2-3 days by adding 200 Î¼L of Mucilairâ¢ medium on the apical side, with an incubation of 20 min at 37 Â°C prior to collection. For IgA treatment, cultures were washed once and then pretreated with antibodies added to the apical compartment for 1 h in 50Î¼L. Viral input was then directly added to reach a final volume of 100 Î¼L. The antibodies were added again at day 2 d.p.i. in the apical compartment during an apical wash (20 min at 37 Â°C). To test the effect of dIgA treatment in the presence of mucus, dIgA were added directly to the apical compartment of MucilAirâ¢ cultures without an initial wash. After IgA treatment for 1h, the virus was added directly to the IgA/mucus mixture and left on the apical side for 4h at 37Â°C. After viral inoculation, a single brief wash was made to remove the viral input while limiting mucus loss. The cultures were then maintained as in the no-mucus condition.</p>

<title>Viral RNA quantification in reconstructed human nasal epithelia</title>
<p id="P39">Apical supernatants were collected, stored at -80 Â°C until thawing and were then diluted 4-fold in PBS in a 96-well plate. Diluted supernatants were inactivated for 20 min at 80 Â°C. For SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification, 1 Î¼L of diluted supernatant was added to 4 Î¼L of PCR reaction mix. PCR was carried out in 384-well plates using the Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) with SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific primers (Forward 5â-TAA TCA GAC AAG GAA CTG ATT A-3â; Reverse 5â-CGA AGG TGT GAC TTC CAT G-3â) on a QuantStudio 6 Flex thermocycler (Applied Biosystems).

<title>Histopathology and immunofluorescence (IF) staining</title>
<p id="P40">The lung and nasal turbinate tissues collected at necropsy were fixed in zinc formalin and then processed into paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. The tissue sections (4 Î¼m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for light microscopy examination as previously described with modifications <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. For identification and localization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in organ tissues, immunofluorescence staining was performed on deparaffinized and rehydrated tissue sections using a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP protein antibody together with an AF488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA). Briefly, the tissue sections were first treated with antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories) in a pressure cooker. After blocking with 0.1% Sudan black B for 15 min and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS at RT for 30 min, the primary rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP antibody (1:4000 dilution with 1% BSA/PBS) was incubated at 4Â°C overnight. This step was followed by incubation with a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min and the sections were then mounted in medium with 4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For identification of DC-SIGN expression, we stained the NT slices with rabbit anti-DC-SIGN primary antibody (Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For identification of ACE2 expression, the goat anti-ACE2 primary antibody (R&amp;D) and Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. All tissue sections were examined, and the fluorescence images and whole section scanning were captured using 5Ã, 10Ã and 20Ã objectives with Carl Zeiss LSM 980. NP<sup>+</sup> cells per field were quantified based on the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) using the ZEN BLACK 3.0 and ImageJ (NIH).</p>

<title>Effects of B8-dIgA on SARS-CoV-2 infection in HK2 cells</title>
<p id="P41">HK2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at the 40-50% confluency and cultured overnight. The B8-dIgA or control dIgA at the concentration of 1, 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml/mL and then mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (1:10 TCID50) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The antibody/virus mixture was then added to HK2 cells after the cell culture medium was removed and washed with PBS once and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C. The infectious medium was replaced with fresh medium containing respective concentration of antibody after washing 3 times with PBS. 24 h later, the infected cells were imaged under fluorescence microscope after staining with AF488-conjugated anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody. Alternatively, the infected cells were lysed and blotted for SARS-CoV-2 NP protein to determine the extent of infection. Tubulin was blotted as the internal control.</p>

The expression of CD209 was measured by flow cytometry. The transfected HEK293T-CD209 cells were seeded into 96-well plates with 2.4Ã10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and cultured overnight. The HEK293T-CD209 cells were pre-treated with 10 ng/ml/mL of B8-dIgA or control dIgA and incubated for 6 h prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI=0.05). 24 h later, cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min and air-dried in the BSC. Cells were fUrther permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with crossreactive rabbit sera anti-SARS-CoV-2-N for 1 hour at RT before adding Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Life Technologies). The fluorescence density of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was acquired using a Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems) and then the MFI of four randomly selected areas of each sample was quantified using Fiji software (NIH).</p>

<title>Isolation of monoclonal antibodies from single B cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients.</title>
<p>
<bold>(A)</bold> RBD-specific binding activities of sera derived from 3 (P1-P3) convalescent and 1 (P4) acute COVID-19 patients as measured by ELISA.</p>
<p>
<bold>(B)</bold> Spike-specific binding activities of sera derived from four COVID-19 patients as measured by ELISA.</p>
<p>
<bold>(C)</bold> Neutralization activities of sera derived from four COVID-19 patients as measured by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in 293T-ACE2 cells.</p>
<p>
<bold>(D)</bold> Antibody gene repertoire analysis of reactive B cells derived from each patient. The number of cloned antibody genes from each patient is shown in the center of each pie chart for both the heavy (H) and light (L) chains. The colors represent specific variable gene family. Each fragment of the same color stands for one specific sub-family.</p>
<p>
<bold>(E)</bold>. The percentage of somatic hypermutation (SHM) compared to germline sequences and the CDR3 amino acid lengths of cloned antibody H and L gene sequences were analyzed for each subject.</p>
<p>
<bold>(F)</bold> RBD (left) and spike (right) specific binding activities of five HuNAbs, including A6, B4, B7, B8 and C5, were measured by ELISA.</p>

<bold>(A)</bold> The effects of B8-dIgA2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the MucilAirâ¢ model, consisting of primary human nasal epithelial cells but no DCs. B8-mIgA2 or B8-dIgA2 were pre-incubated at doses of 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml, respectively, in the apical compartment with or without mucus for 1 hour, before adding 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/France/IDF00372/2020) for 4 hours. The viral RNA loads were measured by RT-PCR in both the apical and basal compartments and are shown in log-transformed units.</p>
<p>
<bold>(B)</bold> Representative confocal images (400Ã) of olfactory epithelium in NT showed the expression of CD209 (DC-SIGN) in green and ACE2 in magenta by immunohistochemical staining of experimental hamsters treated with B8-dIgA2 without (left) or with (middle and right) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Color-coding indicates specific antibodies used for double staining. Infected CD209<sup>+</sup> cells are visualized in yellow as indicated by arrows (right).</p>
<p>
<bold>(C)</bold> The CD209 or CD299 overexpressed-HEK 293T cells were pre-treated for 6 hours with 10 ng/ml of B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 or control dIgA1 or control dIgA2 or PBS, respectively, prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI: 0.05). Two days after infection, SARS-CoV-2 NP expression (green) was quantified by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) after anti-NP IF staining.
