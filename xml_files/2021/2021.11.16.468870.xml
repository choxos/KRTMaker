The influential <italic>Active Systems</italic> account of offline consolidation suggests that sleep-associated memory processing paves the way for new learning, but empirical evidence in support of this idea is scarce. Using a within-subjects (N = 30), crossover design, we assessed behavioural and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adults (aged 18-25 years), and investigated whether behavioural performance was predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations formed the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning, as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: whereas 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization – an established marker of successful encoding – was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, these findings suggest that effective learning depends on sleep, but not necessarily sleep-associated consolidation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Learning</kwd><kwd>Memory</kwd><kwd>Consolidation</kwd><kwd>Beta Desynchronization</kwd><kwd>Sleep Deprivation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">How do we remember events from days gone by? It is now firmly established that sleep facilitates memory consolidation; the process by which weak and initially labile memory traces become strong and enduring representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ashton and Cairney 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ashton et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Cairney et al. 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Durrant et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gais et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gaskell et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Payne et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Talamini et al. 2008</xref>). Whereas sleep was originally thought to provide only passive protection to memory consolidation (i.e. by shielding memories from the interference posed by wakeful experience), recent work suggests that newly formed memories are actively strengthened during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Cairney et al. 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Rasch et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Schönauer et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Schreiner et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Wang et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The influential <italic>Active Systems</italic> account of sleep-associated consolidation posits that the reactivation of hippocampus-dependent memories during slow-wave sleep (SWS) facilitates their migration to neocortex for long-term storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Born and Wilhelm 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Klinzing et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Rasch and Born 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Walker 2009</xref>). Supporting this view, functional neuroimaging studies have shown that overnight consolidation supports a shift in the memory retrieval network from hippocampus to neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Takashima et al. 2009</xref>), with time spent in SWS predicting the reduction in hippocampal retrieval dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cairney et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Takashima et al. 2006</xref>). Along the same lines, other work has shown that post-learning sleep (as compared to sleep deprivation) promotes functional coupling between activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex when retrieval is assessed 48 h later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gais et al. 2007</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that hippocampal-to-neocortical information transfer emerges during the first nights after learning, although the consolidation process presumably takes many weeks or even months to complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dudai 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dudai et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P4">While the benefits of sleep for memory consolidation are well known, recent work has indicated that sleep also supports next-day learning of hippocampus-dependent memories. When a night of sleep deprivation precedes a novel learning opportunity, declarative memory recall is severely impaired, even after recovery sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alberca-Reina et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Cousins et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kaida et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Tempesta et al. 2016</xref>), suggesting that an absence of sleep disrupts memory encoding in hippocampus. Indeed, as compared to a normal night of sleep, sleep deprivation weakens hippocampal responses during successful learning (i.e. for memories that are correctly recalled in a later retrieval test, after recovery sleep), leading to an overall decline in recall performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Yoo et al. 2007</xref>). Correspondingly, daytime naps not only facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Mander et al. 2011</xref>), but also restore hippocampal encoding capabilities, as compared to an equivalent period of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Ong et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The interplay of various brain rhythms has been identified as a key mechanism that regulates communication between hippocampus and neocortex during sleep-associated memory processing. Slow oscillations (&lt; 1 Hz EEG activity) have been causally linked to overnight memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Leminen et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Marshall et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Ngo et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Ong et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Papalambros et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Perl et al. 2016</xref>) and are thought to play a central role in the reactivation and reorganisation of hippocampus-dependent memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Born and Wilhelm 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Klinzing et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Rasch and Born 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Walker 2009</xref>). Delta waves (1-4 Hz), by contrast, have been implicated in forgetting via processes of synaptic renormalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Genzel et al. 2014</xref>) and are thought to interact with slow oscillations to regulate the balance between memory consolidation and weakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kim et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Intriguingly, neural oscillations implicated in overnight memory processing have also been linked to new learning in hippocampus, suggesting that these processes rely on overlapping mechanisms. For example, selectively suppressing slow-wave activity SWA (0.5-4 Hz) via an acoustic perturbation approach impairs declarative memory encoding and reduces encoding-related activity in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Van Der Werf et al. 2009</xref>). Reciprocally, enhancing SWA though electrical stimulation improves encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories but not non-hippocampal procedural skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonenko et al. 2013</xref>). Augmenting slow oscillations via auditory stimulation leads to similar effects, with the magnitude of the slow oscillation enhancement predicting both hippocampal activation and behavioural performance at encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ong et al. 2018</xref>). To what extent memory processes mediated by sleeping brain rhythms contribute to next-day learning capabilities has yet to be directly examined in empirical research.</p><p id="P7">In this pre-registered study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/78dja">osf.io/78dja</ext-link>), we tested the hypothesis that the extent to which individuals consolidate new memories during sleep predicts their ability to encode novel information the following day, and that SWA (0.5-4 Hz) contributes to this relationship. In a within-subjects, crossover design, healthy young adults were trained on a visuospatial memory task before a night of either EEG-monitored sleep or total sleep deprivation, and were tested the following morning. Afterwards, participants were trained on a novel paired-associates task, but were not tested until 48 h later (allowing for recovery sleep in the sleep deprivation condition). Retrieval performance on the visuospatial memory and paired-associates tests thus provided independent metrics of overnight consolidation and next-day learning, respectively.</p><p id="P8">We chose these particular memory tasks because they are both reliant on hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Eichenbaum 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Konkel and Cohen 2009</xref>) and the Active Systems framework is primarily concerned with the overnight consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Born and Wilhelm 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Klinzing et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Rasch and Born 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Walker 2009</xref>). Moreover, previous work has consistently shown that the consolidation of both visuospatial and paired-associate memories is bolstered by overnight sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ashton and Cairney 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ashton et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Cairney et al. 2018b</xref>). We reasoned that employing two conceptually different tasks was optimal as this would ensure that any potential relationship between overnight consolidation and next-day learning would not be influenced by retroactive or proactive interference.</p><p id="P9">By comparing overnight sleep and sleep deprivation, we could also investigate how protracted wakefulness affects the neural correlates of learning. Specifically, EEG recordings were acquired during paired-associates learning to test the hypothesis that sleep deprivation disrupts theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (&gt; 40 Hz) synchronisation, which support item binding in episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Henin et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Köster et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Osipova et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Summerfield and Mangels 2005</xref>). Furthermore, in an exploratory analysis, we investigated the effect of sleep deprivation on 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization; an established marker of successful learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Griffiths et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hanslmayr et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hanslmayr et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hanslmayr et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Hanslmayr et al. 2011</xref>).

Memory consolidation was indexed by the change in visuospatial memory accuracy between the immediate and delayed test. For each participant and test, we computed an error score for each image by calculating the distance (cm) between the recalled location (image centre) and the location that the image had appeared at passive viewing. We derived a retention index (RI) by subtracting the error score at the delayed test from the error score at the immediate test for each image, and then averaging across images. A follow-up RI was calculated between the immediate and follow-up tests using the same method.

For lower frequencies, data were convolved with a 5-cycle Hanning taper in 0.5 Hz frequency steps and 5 ms time steps using an adaptive window-length (i.e. where window length decreases with increasing frequency, e.g. 1.25 s at 4 Hz and 1 s at 5 Hz, to retain 5 cycles).

In keeping with these studies, we found that memory retention and next-day learning benefited from overnight sleep relative to sleep deprivation.</p><p id="P56">Although this was a pre-registered investigation of sleep’s role in learning and memory, and was motivated by prior work on the same topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gais et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Yoo et al. 2007</xref>), it is important to consider the extent to which our findings can disentangle the memory effects of sleep from the disruptive influences of sleep deprivation. Extended periods of wakefulness give rise to various cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Krause et al. 2017</xref>), meaning that poorer performance in the sleep deprivation (vs sleep) condition could reflect the indirect consequences of sleep loss, rather than a direct absence of sleep (indeed, participants in the current study were slower to respond on the PVT and reported being less alert on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale after sleep deprivation than sleep). Focusing first on our assessment of overnight consolidation, generalised cognitive impairments arising from sleep deprivation could have impaired retrieval performance, creating the impression of a sleep-associated improvement in retention. While this is a reasonable concern in view of the sleep-memory effects observed at our delayed test (which followed immediately after the overnight interval), it does not explain why the retention advantage in the sleep condition was still present 48 h later (once sleep deprived individuals had had ample opportunity for recovery sleep). Moreover, we observed no significant relationship between the benefits of sleep (vs sleep deprivation) on memory retention and between-conditions differences in Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores or PVT response times, suggesting that our findings were not driven by the general cognitive impairments that accompany sleep deprivation. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that our data reflect a positive impact of sleep on memory consolidation. To what extent this memory benefit of sleep can be explained by an absence of wakeful interference (such as that experienced in the sleep deprivation condition) or an active sleep-dependent consolidation mechanism, however, cannot be inferred from our data.</p><p id="P57">Turning to our analysis of next-day learning, although the assessment phase also took place 48 h after encoding, the initial learning phase occurred immediately after sleep or sleep deprivation. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the apparent improvement in encoding performance after sleep was influenced by generalised cognitive impairments following sleep deprivation. Importantly, however, we think that our EEG data provide reasonable evidence that an absence of sleep does in itself disrupt new learning. Specifically, if our effects were driven by non-specific cognitive deficits following sleep deprivation, one would expect to have observed only generalised differences in EEG activity between the sleep and sleep deprivation conditions (i.e. only a main effect of condition, across all encoding trials). By contrast, a significant interaction showed that beta desynchronization was amplified in the sleep (vs sleep deprivation) condition, specifically on trials for which adjective-image pairings were subsequently remembered. This impact of sleep on beta desynchronization during successful learning was not predicted by between-condition differences in Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores or PVT response times, and no between-condition difference in beta power emerged for pairings that were subsequently forgotten (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4b and 4c</xref>). Because beta desynchronization is an established neural marker of semantic processing during successful learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Griffiths et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hanslmayr et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Hanslmayr et al. 2011</xref>), these findings may suggest that the neural mechanisms of encoding are indeed disrupted by an absence of sleep. Further support for this view is available below, where we outline how the brain may engage in compensatory learning strategies when semantic processing pathways are compromised by sleep deprivation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S43">Sleep loss disrupts effective learning</xref>).</p><p id="P58">Because our retention index was based on tests for the same items at the immediate, delayed and follow-up sessions, it is possible that our data were influenced by retrieval practice effects (i.e. memories that undergo retrieval practice are typically better remembered than those that do not, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Carpenter et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Roediger and Karpicke 2006</xref>). That is, the retention advantage observed after sleep (vs sleep deprivation) at the delayed test might have been maintained at the follow-up test as a result of retrieval practice. However, given that memories strengthened through retrieval gain little benefit from sleep-associated consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antony et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Antony and Paller 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bäuml et al. 2014</xref>), then, under a retrieval practice hypothesis, the immediate test should have nullified any later impact of sleep on retention. While it may still be argued that a between-condition difference in retention at the delayed test was driven by non-specific impairments following sleep deprivation, this would not explain why the memory advantage in the sleep condition was still present 48 h later (once recovery sleep had taken place). We therefore think that retrieval practice effects cannot provide a reasonable explanation of our findings.</p><p id="P59">Given that recovery sleep after sleep deprivation is characterised by a homeostatic increase in SWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Borbély 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Borbély et al. 2016</xref>), one might have expected the overnight consolidation of newly learned adjective-image pairings to be amplified in the sleep deprivation (vs sleep) condition, potentially tempering the initial impact of sleep loss on encoding. Although we did not record sleep EEG during the time that participants were away from the laboratory (and thus have no insight into homeostatic increases in SWS after sleep deprivation), we did monitor sleep behaviour with wristwatch actigraphy. Participants slept for longer during the first night after learning in the sleep deprivation (vs sleep) condition, but this between-condition difference in sleep duration was not significantly correlated with the magnitude of sleep’s benefit for learning. This suggests that longer recovery sleep in the sleep deprivation condition did not meaningfully influence the impact of sleep loss on new learning.</p><p id="P60">It is worth noting, though, that an enhanced consolidation of newly learned adjective-image pairings in the sleep deprivation (vs sleep) condition (due to longer or deeper recovery sleep) could have obscured a relationship between sleep-associated memory retention and next-day learning in our multiple regression analysis. However, the same null effects were observed when our analysis was restricted to data from the sleep condition alone, rather than subtractions between the sleep and sleep deprivation conditions (as was done in our primary analysis). Hence, no relationship between overnight consolidation and next-day learning was observed when the influence of sleep deprivation (and the putative enhancement of sleep-associated consolidation during recovery sleep) was removed from our data.</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>No link between sleep-associated consolidation and next-day learning</title><p id="P61">If memory consolidation during SWS supports a shift in the memory retrieval network from hippocampus to neocortex, then sleep-associated consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories should predict next-day learning of new, hippocampally-mediated associations, and SWA should facilitate this relationship. However, we observed no such effects in our data, suggesting that new learning in hippocampus may not be contingent on hippocampal memory processing during the preceding night of sleep.</p><p id="P62">An alternative interpretation of these null effects is that our experimental paradigm could not provide an adequate test of our hypothesis. Although we reasoned that the use of two conceptually different hippocampus-dependent tasks would prevent our findings from being influenced by retroactive or proactive interference, qualitative differences between these tasks might have negated our ability to detect a relationship between sleep-associated memory consolidation and next-day learning. This is nevertheless a speculative suggestion that can be addressed in future research (e.g. by using a paired-associates task to assess both overnight memory retention and subsequent encoding).</p><p id="P63">Although our study was motivated by the assumptions of the Active Systems framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Born and Wilhelm 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Klinzing et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Rasch and Born 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Walker 2009</xref>), it is important to also consider our findings in the context of homeostatic synaptic downscaling, which is regarded as another fundamental mechanism through which sleep supports learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Tononi and Cirelli 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">2016</xref>). From this perspective, sleep is the price the brain pays for waking plasticity, in order to avoid an accumulation of synaptic upscaling. Because synaptic renormalization should mainly occur during sleep (when neural circuits can undergo a broad and systematic synaptic downscaling), a night of sleep deprivation would prevent the restoration of cellular homeostasis and impair next-day learning. A number of theoretical accounts of sleep-associated memory processing have made progress in reconciling the key tenets of the Active Systems and Synaptic Homeostasis frameworks, suggesting that these processes work in concert to support global plasticity and local downscaling, respectively, and in doing so prepare the hippocampus for future encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Genzel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Klinzing et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Lewis and Durrant 2011</xref>). Interestingly, whereas global memory replay and consolidation have been linked to slow (&lt; 1 Hz) oscillations, downscaling and forgetting are associated with delta waves (1-4 Hz) in local networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Genzel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kim et al. 2019</xref>). How interactions between global slow oscillations and local delta waves regulate overnight memory processing is therefore pertinent to further understanding of the relationship between sleep-associated consolidation and next-day learning.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Sleep loss disrupts effective learning</title><p id="P64">Successful learning is associated with left-lateralised beta desynchronization ~0.5-1.5s after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Griffiths et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Griffiths et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hanslmayr et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hanslmayr et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hanslmayr et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Hanslmayr et al. 2011</xref>). Consistent with these prior studies, we observed a decrease in beta power ~0.3-2 s after stimulus onset during the encoding of subsequently remembered (vs forgotten) associations, and this was most pronounced in the left hemisphere. Beta desynchronization is thought to reflect semantic processing during successful memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Fellner et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Hanslmayr et al. 2011</xref>); as beta power decreases, the depth of semantic processing increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hanslmayr et al. 2009</xref>). More broadly, neocortical alpha/beta oscillations have been linked to the processing of incoming information during episodic encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Griffiths et al. 2021</xref>). For our learning task, participants were instructed to form vivid mental images or stories that linked the adjective and image of each pairing. The observed downregulation of beta power during successful learning might thus reflect an engagement of information processing operations, possibly involving semantic representations, allowing these novel associations to be bound together into one coherent episode and committed to memory.</p><p id="P65">Importantly, however, the change in beta power that accompanied successful learning differed according to whether participants had slept or remained awake across the overnight interval. Whereas encoding of subsequently remembered (vs forgotten) adjective-image pairings was associated with beta desynchronization after sleep, no significant difference in beta power emerged from the same contrast after sleep deprivation. Hence, a protracted lack of sleep appeared to disrupt semantic processing operations when participants were successfully forming new memories. This interpretation is in line with previous behavioural findings where sleep deprived individuals have had difficulty in encoding semantically incongruent stimulus pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alberca-Reina et al. 2014</xref>). The sleep deprived brain might thus rely on alternative processing routes when committing new information to memory. Indeed, prior studies have shown that sleep deprivation leads to compensatory neural responses during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Chee and Choo 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Drummond et al. 2004</xref>) and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Sterpenich et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P66">What might be the nature of this alternative route to learning after sleep deprivation? It is interesting to note that we observed an upregulation of beta activity during successful (vs unsuccessful) learning in the sleep deprivation condition (although this difference did not survive a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Increases in beta power have been linked to working memory and active rehearsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Deiber et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Hwang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Onton et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Tallon-Baudry et al. 2001</xref>), suggesting that sleep-deprived individuals may engage in more surface-based rehearsal strategies due to semantic processing pathways being compromised by an absence of sleep.</p><p id="P67">It is important to note that the foregoing findings on beta desynchronization arose from an exploratory analysis that was not pre-registered, and should therefore be treated with caution until such time that they are replicated in confirmatory research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S44" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P68">We investigated whether memory consolidation in sleep predicts next-day learning and whether SWA contributes to this relationship. Furthermore, we investigated how the neural correlates of successful learning are affected by sleep deprivation. Although sleep improved both memory retention and next-day learning, we found no evidence of a relationship between these measures, nor with SWA. Whereas beta desynchronization – an established marker of semantic processing during successful learning – was present during the encoding of subsequently remembered (vs forgotten) associations after sleep, no such difference in beta power was observed after sleep deprivation. An extended lack of sleep might therefore disrupt our ability to draw upon semantic knowledge when encoding novel associations, necessitating the use of more surface-based and ultimately suboptimal routes to learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS144123-supplement-Supplementary_Material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d86aAeFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S45"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Marcus O.

               <bold>a)</bold> Study timeline. The colours represent the tasks: visuospatial task in yellow (see b) and paired-associates task in green (see c). Participants arrived in the evening to complete the visuospatial task (training and immediate test). After overnight sleep or sleep deprivation, participants were tested again (delayed test) and then completed the learning phase of the paired-associates task. Participants returned 48 h later (after recovery sleep) to complete the paired-associates test and a follow-up visuospatial memory test. EEG recordings were acquired during sleep and paired-associates learning. The study was a within-subjects comparison of sleep and sleep deprivation (condition order counterbalanced across participants). ISI = Interstimulus interval.</p><p>
               <bold>b)</bold> Visuospatial memory task. Participants completed one round of passive viewing, during which they viewed the location of each image on a grid. Next, in the active viewing phase, participants moved each image to the location that they thought it had appeared during passive viewing and received feedback on its correct location (dashed frame). Active viewing continued until participants had met the performance criterion for all images (&lt; 4.8cm from correct location, mean ± SD number of rounds to meet criterion: Sleep: 8.77 ± 2.39, Sleep Deprivation: 9.07 ± 2.89). The test phases followed the same procedures as one round of active viewing, but no feedback was provided.

               <bold>c)</bold> Paired-associates task. Participants completed one round of learning, during which they encoded adjective-image pairings. At test, a word was presented in isolation and participants first indicated whether it was ‘old’ (i.e. they recognised the word from learning) or ‘new’ (i.e. they did not recognise the word from learning). For correctly recognised (old) words, participants then indicated which of the four presented images was associated with that word at learning. For words identified as new, or for previously unseen words that were incorrectly identified as old, participants moved immediately onto the next trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS144123-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Behaviour.</title><p>
