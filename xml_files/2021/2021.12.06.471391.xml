A key requirement for repeated identification of stimuli is reliable representation by the neural code on each encounter. Synaptic transmission underlies neural codes propagation between brain regions. A hallmark of chemical synapses is their plasticity, which enables signal transfer to be modified in an activity-dependent manner. Despite many decades of intense research on synapses, it remains unclear how the plastic features of synaptic transmission can maintain reliable neural coding. By studying the olfactory system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we aimed to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how synaptic function shapes neural coding reliability in the live, behaving animal. We show that the properties of the active zone (AZ), the presynaptic site of neurotransmitter release, are critical for generating a reliable neural code. Reducing neurotransmitter release probability specifically at AZs of olfactory sensory neurons disrupted both neural coding and behavioral reliability. Strikingly, these defects were rescued within a day by target-specific synaptic plasticity, whereby a homeostatic increase in the number of AZs compensated the drop in release probability. These findings demonstrate an important role for synaptic plasticity in maintaining neural coding reliability and are of pathophysiological interest by uncovering an elegant mechanism through which the neural circuitry can counterbalance perturbations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neural code reliability</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>homeostatic compensation</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>presynaptic function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Animals encounter the same stimuli repeatedly and are able to recognize them over and over again. An essential requirement for the repeated identification of a stimulus is that its representation by the neural code will be reliably reproduced on each occasion. Two major approaches are used to describe neural coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The first is rate coding, where the firing rate of action potentials over a period of time is employed as the neural code. The second is temporal coding, where the precise timing and the precise pattern of action potentials is utilized for coding. Often, a combination of the two strategies is used as the coin of information for neural coding: the firing rate within a relatively small time window along with changes in firing rate over time.</p><p id="P3">Coding of an external stimulus by the nervous system begins at the sensory neurons. The code then undergoes transformations as it passes across synaptic contacts and propagates to higher brain regions. Chemical synaptic transmission is the major mode of fast information transfer between neurons. The response of a postsynaptic neuron depends on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (SVs) fusing with the plasma membrane at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). SV fusion, in turn, is regulated by the complex interplay of various specialized AZ proteins, which determine neurotransmitter release sites and control release probability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms of SV fusion are highly dynamic and can be modified on timescales ranging from milliseconds to days. Such presynaptic plasticity involves e.g. changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, SV availability, and activity-dependent modulations of the release machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Importantly, synapses are also under homeostatic control. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity describes a phenomenon whereby pre- or postsynaptic adjustments maintain synaptic stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. This evolutionarily conserved process rebalances destabilizing perturbations and preserves functionality in a changing environment. Correspondingly, dysfunctional homeostatic synaptic plasticity has been implicated in several neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Considering the many facets of synaptic plasticity, the question arises how the reliability of the neural code is affected by dynamic changes in neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system is highly amenable to genetic manipulations and is suitable to examine how synaptic function and plasticity affect neural code reliability. In flies, odors activate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In general, each ORN expresses a single odorant receptor gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (but note ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>). Approximately 20-40 ORNs expressing the same receptor send their axons to a single glomerulus in the antennal lobe (AL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Approximately 2-5 second-order projection neurons (PNs), in turn, send their dendrites to a single glomerulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and each PN samples all arriving ORNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The synaptic connection between an individual ORN and PN harbors ~10-30 release sites (scaling with glomerulus size) possessing a high average release probability (~0.75)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The AL also contains multi-glomeruli inhibitory GABAergic and glutamatergic local neurons (iLNs) and excitatory cholinergic LNs (eLNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The ORN-PN synapse is mainly modulated by the GABAergic iLNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORN-PN connection is a system with a reliable synapse, which can be genetically modified and examined in the context of physiological odor stimuli.</p><p id="P5">By performing <italic>in vivo</italic> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from over 1300 neurons, we show that knocking down the AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cacophony (Cac) specifically in ORNs decreases the reliability of the neural code in the postsynaptic PNs to physiological odor stimuli. Our results demonstrate that interfering with SV release probability from ORN AZs affects the PN neural code in three ways. First, the initial transient phase of the odor response, when PNs reach their highest firing rates, becomes more variable due to reduced recruitment of iLNs. Second, the onset of the odor response is delayed and more variable. Third, the temporal dynamics of the odor response become less reliable; this third result does not involve any circuit motifs and results from monosynaptic effects. In line with its ethological relevance, reducing the reliability of neural coding leads to a reduction in the behavioral ability to correctly classify an olfactory stimulus. Surprisingly, however, we find that decreased expression of Cac at ORN AZs affects neural code reliability only at high stimulus intensities. This differential effect is due to homeostatic synaptic plasticity, which sets in within a day. Thereby, the formation of additional AZs compensates the reduced neurotransmitter release probability and rescues the coding reliability of PNs. Thus, our work uncovers a new role for homeostatic synaptic plasticity in maintaining stable neural coding and reliable behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ORN SVs release probability affects olfactory coding reliability at high odor intensities</title><p id="P6">In order to investigate how molecular properties of the AZ influence the olfactory neural code, we recorded postsynaptic PN responses to odor presentation with <italic>in vivo</italic> whole-cell current-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used RNA interference (RNAi) in ORNs to knock down Cac, the pore-forming subunit of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cav2-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, which mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx at the AZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Since different odors elicit different firing rates and temporal dynamics in ORNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> we tested PN responses to five different odors (Isopenthyl acetate, linalool, 2-heptanone, ethyl acetate and isobutyl acetate) and used high odor concentrations to minimize variations in ORN responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To examine stimulus-evoked response reliability we recorded PN responses to 10 applications of each odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>Orco</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> was used to drive <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> specifically in ORNs and <italic>GH146</italic>-<italic>QF</italic>, which labels approximately 60% of PNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, was used to drive <italic>QUAS</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> for targeted patch-clamp recordings. We confirmed RNAi efficiency for Cac by performing <italic>in vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging via two-photon microscopy during odor stimulation. <italic>Orco</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> was used to drive <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> along with <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>GCaMP6f</italic>. As expected, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were significantly reduced in ORN terminals when Cac was targeted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). In addition, direct staining against Cac demonstrated reduced Cac levels in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> significantly reduced odor-induced PN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>), illustrating that SV release from ORNs was decreased, though not completely abolished.</p><p id="P7">A number of different methods can be used to examine neural code reliability. Correlation-based measurement of coding reliability examines the reliability of the temporal dynamics of neural activity by analyzing the activity time-series as a single entity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, this analysis examines the pattern of the response over time, but does not consider the magnitude of the response. Therefore, correlation measurements do not account for variations in firing rate at a specific time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A, C</xref>). Another measure of temporal code reliability is the latency of the first spike following odor presentation, which was show to encode odor identify and intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The standard deviation of response magnitude examines response reliability for a given time point or a given firing rate and does not account for the temporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B, C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">At high odor concentration, correlation analysis using spike trains that were integrated at increasingly wider temporal windows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), revealed that for wild type (<italic>wt</italic>) flies the response reliability (correlation value) became saturated at ~20 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Knockdown of Cac decreased overall correlation values and increased the temporal integration window required to reach saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A, B</xref>). This demonstrates that molecular perturbations of ORN AZs decrease the temporal reliability of PN responses. Standard deviations of PN firing rate, as a function of the mean firing rate during a 20 ms time window, also revealed a decrease in PN coding reliability in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>) with PNs showing increased variability especially at high firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">PN somata, which are accessed during patch-clamp recording, are distant from the action potential initiation site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. As a result, action potentials recorded at the soma in current-clamp mode are very small, often reaching only 5 mV in amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Such small action potentials are frequently not identified during the rising phase of the odor response. To better detect the first action potential, indicating the response onset, we repeated this set of experiments in voltage-clamp mode. Indeed, voltage-clamp recordings enabled detection of more action potentials in the first 25 ms of the odor response and the latency of the first action potential was shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-I</xref>). As with the other neural coding reliability measurements, this analysis revealed that knocking down Cac resulted in lower reliability, reflected by both increased latency and increased standard deviation of the first action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J, K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P10">High odor concentrations elicit high firing rates in ORNs that may reach up to 300 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. To examine if the effect of <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> persists when ORNs fire at lower rates, we repeated the above experiments using a weaker odor intensity. Interestingly, we found that under these conditions, response magnitude and coding reliability by PNs was not decreased by reduced Cac expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L-O</xref>). Taken together, our data show that reducing SV release from ORNs affects the reliability of the postsynaptic odor response. However, this effect is only evident during the presentation of a strong olfactory stimulus.</p><p id="P11">The above results suggest that high-frequency synaptic transmission is most sensitive to manipulations of ORN AZs, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. High firing rates usually occur at the beginning of the odor response within the first 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Thus, we examined the effects of <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> during the presentation of a strong olfactory stimulus without the initial phase of the odor response. The initial phase of the odor response is characterized by a strong increase in firing rate that is highly correlated. Thus, as expected, removing the first 200 ms of the odor response from the analysis resulted in an overall decrease in correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1P</xref> compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which was further reduced by <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1P, Q</xref>). In contrast, the increased standard deviation of PN firing rates that was observed upon <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> was now completely abolished. No difference in the standard deviation was observed between <italic>wt</italic> and RNAi flies even though high firing rates were still obtained in the sustained phase of the odor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1R</xref>). The effect of <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> was not equally distributed throughout the initial phase of the odor response; rather it was most notable when the PNs reached their peak firing rate, approximately 20ms after the response onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1S</xref>). These results suggest that two different mechanisms underlie the reduced response reliability of PNs, one affecting the reliability of the structure of the temporal firing rate dynamics and the other affecting the reliability of the absolute firing rate magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Knockdown of Cac reduces release probability and increases synaptic latency and jitter</title><p id="P12">Reducing Cac expression in ORNs significantly reduced PN spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, PNs maintained a substantial response to odors, demonstrating that synaptic transmission from ORNs to PNs remained principally functional. Cac is a key regulator of SV release probability at <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular AZs. Its functional disruption in a temperature-sensitive mutant, RNAi-mediated knockdown, and impaired AZ channel clustering all lead to greatly decreased eEPSC (evoked excitatory postsynaptic current) amplitudes at the NMJ, especially at low stimulation frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We were therefore intrigued by the observation that <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> affected PN coding reliability only at high and not at low ORN firing rates. To better understand this phenomenon, we characterized functional properties of the ORN-PN synapse in <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, the average eEPSC amplitude of <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> did not differ from <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, Cac knockdown led to increased paired-pulse facilitation at short inter-pulse intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), consistent with a decrease in SV release probability upon reduced expression of AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In line with a drop in release probability, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> synapses also displayed significantly elevated synaptic delay (eEPSC latency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), which was accompanied by an increase in the jitter of eEPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, both parameters progressively increased with stimulation frequency in the transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Within our sampling range (1, 10, 20, 60 Hz), the effect of presynaptic <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> on these temporal parameters was most pronounced at 60 Hz.</p><p id="P13">Taken together, these results suggest a homeostatic mechanism at the ORN-PN synapse, which compensates for the drop in release probability caused by presynaptic Cac knockdown to maintain normal eEPSC amplitudes. However, this compensation does not cover the temporal properties of synaptic transmission. The reduced release probability of <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> ORNs generates longer synaptic latencies with larger eEPSC jitter, consistent with increased first spike latencies and jitter during odor application. Thus, while the ORN-PN synapse is surprisingly resilient to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel perturbations, Cac knockdown delays synaptic transmission and reduces the temporal precision of synaptic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A homeostatic increase in AZ number and synaptic strength compensates for the drop in release probability</title><p id="P14">So far, all experiments were carried out on 2-4 day old flies. To obtain more information on the homeostatic regulation of the ORN-PN connection, we next addressed the time course of the synaptic adjustment. At day 0 (less than 24 h post pupal eclosion), <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> caused a reduction in both release probability and eEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> synapses responded in only 19 out of 40 cases irrespective of stimulus intensity. In contrast, at day 1 (24-48 h post pupal eclosion), eEPSC amplitudes were already elevated to <italic>wt</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I, J</xref>) and the transmission success rate reached 100%. When presented with a high odor concentration at day 0, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies displayed decreased firing rates and reduced coding reliability compared to <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K-O</xref>) and to 2-4 days old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). However, when a low odor concentration was applied, both firing rates and neural code reliability remained severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2P, Q</xref>), contrary to the compensation observed in 2-4 days old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L-O</xref>). Thus, homeostatic synaptic plasticity took place within the first day post eclosion to rescue neural activity and coding reliability at low stimulus intensity but failed to do so at high odor concentrations.</p><p id="P15">Next, we turned to the mechanism underlying the homeostatic synaptic change responsible for maintaining normal eEPSC amplitudes. In principle, the drop in release probability caused by <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> could be counterbalanced by an increase in the number of presynaptic release sites or an increase in quantal size. Quantal size describes the postsynaptic response to the fusion of an individual SV with the AZ membrane. This parameter is reflected by the amplitude of spontaneously occurring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (minis) and can be influenced by the number and identity of postsynaptic receptors. We recorded similar mini frequencies and amplitudes at <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2R, S</xref>) demonstrating an unaltered quantal size and, in turn, suggesting a homeostatic addition of release sites. In line with a corresponding increase in postsynaptic receptor fields, puffing nicotine onto PNs elicited larger currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2T</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Based on these results, we sought to match the functional increase of release sites in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> to a structural correlate. To this end, we performed immunostainings of the antennal lobe and imaged Bruchpilot (Brp), a core component of the AZ cytomatrix (CAZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>), via confocal microscopy. To restrict our analysis to ORN-PN synapses, we co-labelled postsynaptic PNs via GFP and quantified Brp labels in the overlapping regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2V</xref>). Consistent with the electrophysiological estimate of release site addition, the number of Brp clusters was significantly increased upon Cac knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2U</xref>). Moreover, while the average cluster size remained unchanged in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, the signal intensity was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2U</xref>), possibly reflecting the addition of CAZ units below the diffraction limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, a homeostatic increase in the number of Brp-positive AZs counterbalanced the decreased transmitter release probability caused by reduced Cac expression.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Monosynaptic effects and circuit activity underlie distinct features of coding reliability</title><p id="P17">Next, we examined whether the diminished coding reliability caused by <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> is due to monosynaptic mechanisms or instead arises from circuit effects. GABAergic iLNs also receive their major input from ORNs and inhibit these presynaptically. Whereas PNs are uniglomerular and receive homogenous ORN input, iLNs are multiglomerular and receive heterogeneous ORN input. PNs respond to ORN activity in a non-linear manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In contrast, GABAergic iLNs respond linearly to ORN activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, are more sensitive to reduced input from ORNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and show a stronger transiency in their odor response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, we speculated that at least some of the observed reduction in PN reliability following presynaptic manipulations might arise from reduced recruitment of iLNs. In particular, this may explain the increased standard deviation in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> that no longer occurred in the absence of the initial transient phase of PN odor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1R, S</xref>). To examine how iLN activity affects PN odor response reliability we compared <italic>wt</italic> and presynaptic <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Orco</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> again drove <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>449-QF</italic> was used to express <italic>QUAS</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> in iLNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Reducing Cac protein levels in ORNs resulted in an almost complete abolishment of iLN responses to odors in both 0 and 2-4 days old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Similar to PNs, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> reduced the SV release probability at the ORN-iLN synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, in contrast to ORN-PN transmission, we observed no homeostatic rescue of iLN responses to odor stimulation even in 2-4 days old flies.</p><p id="P18">These results demonstrate that knocking down Cac in ORNs severely impairs the activation of iLNs. We therefore examined the effects of blocking GABAergic transmission on PN reliability. To this end, we exposed the brain to 100 μM CGP54626, a selective GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist, and 250 μM picrotoxin, a chloride channel blocker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and antagonist of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected, GABA blockers affected <italic>wt</italic> firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) but had no effect on PN spiking in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies, where iLNs are hardly recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). When blocking GABA receptors in <italic>wt</italic> flies, we observed a significant increase in the variability of PN activity but the temporal integration window of PN responses was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). This suggests that iLNs affect only certain aspects of the code reliability. Since the odor response of iLNs was diminished when Cac was knocked down in ORNs we expected that blocking GABA receptors would not further affect coding reliability in <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies. Indeed, blocking GABAergic transmission had no effect whatsoever on variability and only a minor effect on the temporal integration window in presynaptic <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The AL also contains another population of inhibitory local neurons, which release glutamate.

Thus, the pharmacological experiments affect both the presynapse of ORNs and the postsynapse of PNs. Since iLNs mainly act by activating GABA-B receptors in the presynaptic terminal of ORNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, we tested whether driving <italic>GABA</italic>-<italic>B</italic>-<italic>R2<sup>RNAi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup></italic> in ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>) has similar effects on PN coding reliability as pharmacologically blocking the inhibitory iLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Therefore, we expressed an RNAi construct against GluClα in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>) and tested their odor response and coding reliability. Knockdown of the GluClα receptor in PNs had a strong effect on coding variability, as observed for the pharmacological experiments and by blocking the inhibitory presynaptic circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>). In addition, we also observed an overall decrease in correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, which increased PN integration time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), we did not observe any such increase in <italic>GluClα<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, if at all, the integration time of PNs was slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).

To examine whether these changes are strong enough to affect behavioral output we tested the flies’ ability to correctly classify an ecologically relevant stimulus. To reduce response variability, which is often observed for naïve behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, we paired isopentyl acetate with an electric shock, using a well-established custom built apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and tested the accuracy of the animals’ behavioral responses, i.e. avoidance of isopentyl acetate. Following prolonged exposure (2 minutes) to the olfactory stimulus, presynaptic <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals were equally successful as their parental controls in classifying the odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), indicating no impairment in the flies learning capabilities. However, when flies navigate in their natural habitat, olfactory stimuli are often brief and repetitive. Since such short stimuli could not be delivered in the above paradigm, we used an alternative assay in which the flies walked on a Styrofoam ball. This setting allowed us to present the same pattern of olfactory stimuli as used for the electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Ten one-second trials of the shock-paired odor isopentyl acetate were presented and the behavioral response was classified as correct if flies turned away from the odor source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies made significantly fewer correct choices as a result of identifying isopentyl acetate less reliably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This reduction in correct stimulus classification was not due to a learning defect since the learning index was similar between <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, Cac knockdown was only performed in the first order ORNs and not in third order neurons, which are required for memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Since our electrophysiological results showed that homeostatic synaptic plasticity rescues the neural code reliability only at lower odor concentrations, we tested whether behavioral reliability was also rescued at low stimulation intensities. The overall learning scores of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies were similar at low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) and high odor concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). As predicted, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies were as successful as <italic>wt</italic> animals in correctly classifying the low concentration odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, while <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals displayed normal memory formation at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), low concentration odor classification was significantly impaired in young flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). This nicely matches our finding that homeostatic compensation takes a day to develop. In summary, these results demonstrate how synaptic plasticity can maintain neural coding reliability and enable the animal to consistently classify an important physiological stimulus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we addressed two distinct yet related questions. First, we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the molecular integrity of the AZ is important for neural coding reliability. Second, we demonstrate that homeostatic synaptic plasticity operates at the ORN-PN synapse and that this process compensates a reduction in release probability by increasing the number of ORN AZs. The homeostatic adjustment restored eEPSC amplitudes in PNs and neural coding reliability. We further show that the restored neural reliability maintains behavioral performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the homeostatic compensation is limited in its efficiency and fails to maintain reliable neural coding and behaviour at elevated firing frequencies in response to high odor concentrations.</p><p id="P22">Using <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings, we show that high release probability of ORN AZs is required for a reliable neural code in the postsynaptic PNs in response to physiological odor stimuli. Knockdown of Cacophony from ORN AZs that reduced ORN release probability affected neural code reliability in several manners. First, the high firing rates of the initial transient phase of PN odor responses became more variable due to reduced recruitment of iLNs. Second, the onset of odor responses was delayed and more variable. Third, the temporal dynamics of the odor response became less reliable. This third effect results most probably from monosynaptic changes to ORN-PN transmission. At a behavioral level, we find that reduced coding reliability of PNs impairs the animals’ ability to correctly classify a physiologically relevant stimulus.</p><p id="P23">We found that knocking down Cacophony affected neuronal coding reliability mainly at high firing rates. This was true for both the monosynaptic as well as the circuit mechanisms. In terms of the circuit effects on rate code reliability, this is in line with the recruitment of iLNs. iLNs sample many types of ORNs with different response profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and as a result, they respond linearly to ORN activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, iLNs respond most strongly to high ORN firing rates, which in turn are triggered by high odor intensities. Correspondingly, almost entirely eliminating the recruitment of iLNs by manipulating ORN AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), mostly affects processing of high firing rates. We find that a decrease in SV release probability increases the latency and jitter of eEPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), accompanied by an increase in the latency and jitter of postsynaptic action potential initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We further show that this drop in the temporal precision of synaptic transmission increases in a frequency-dependent manner. This finding helps to explain why disrupted AZ function mainly impairs temporal coding at high firing rates and strong odor intensities.</p><p id="P24">Theoretical studies have suggested that decreasing SV release probability should result in reduced neural coding reliability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, although exceptions have also been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. However, whether these theoretical studies hold true <italic>in vivo</italic>, with highly dynamic synaptic properties, in complex neural circuits, and in response to physiological stimuli has remained an open question. To the best of our knowledge, the present study provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that interfering with the molecular control of SV release results in reduced neural coding reliability. Notably, the ORN-PN synapse is surprisingly resilient to reduced AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel expression and compensates the drop in release probability by increasing the number of AZs to yield normal eEPSC amplitudes. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity features at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, mushroom body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, and also operates in the antennal lobe to match synaptic strength to PN excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>Cac<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> decreases synaptic transmission to a greater extent from ORNs to iLNs than from ORNs to PNs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Thus, the functional impact of Cac or mechanisms to compensate for reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel expression differ between ORN AZs depending on the identity of the postsynaptic partner. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that during the time window of homeostatic compensation, i.e. the first day post-eclosion, ORNs and PNs show structural changes involving increased Brp expression and neurite expansion, while iLNs do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that this developmental stability prevents or limits structural homeostatic plasticity at ORN-iLN synapses. Moreover, parallels may exist with the NMJ, where the expression of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity is compartmentalized to a subset of a motoneuron’s synapses depending on their target muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.
