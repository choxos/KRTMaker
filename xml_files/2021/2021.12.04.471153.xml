<abstract>
<p id="P1">The ability of pathogens to develop drug resistance is a global health challenge. The SARS-CoV-2 virus presents an urgent need wherein several variants of concern resist neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapies and vaccine-induced sera. Decoy nanoparticles—cell-mimicking particles that bind and inhibit virions—are an emerging class of therapeutics that may overcome such drug resistance challenges. To date, we lack quantitative understanding as to how design features impact performance of these therapeutics. To address this gap, here we perform a systematic, comparative evaluation of various biologically-derived nanoscale vesicles, which may be particularly well-suited to sustained or repeated administration in the clinic due to low toxicity, and investigate their potential to inhibit multiple classes of model SARS-CoV-2 virions. A key finding is that such particles exhibit potent antiviral efficacy across multiple manufacturing methods, vesicle subclasses, and virus-decoy binding affinities. In addition, these cell-mimicking vesicles effectively inhibit model SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade monoclonal antibodies and recombinant protein-based decoy inhibitors. This study provides a foundation of knowledge that may guide the design of decoy nanoparticle inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.</p>

<p id="P2">The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has killed over 5.2M people globally and dramatically underscored the need for therapeutics for treating infectious disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> The authorization of effective vaccines successfully curbed the pandemic in some locations, but the inability to sufficiently vaccinate the global population and the evolution of highly transmissive, vaccine sera-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants have sustained the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> The development and approval of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that neutralize virions emerged as a viable treatment early in the pandemic and continues to play an important role in treating severe forms of the disease. Unfortunately, circulating viral strains contain mutations in key glycoprotein residues that have rendered several mAb treatments in development, and 60% of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized mAbs, ineffective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> Therapies capable of combating circulating and evolving viral strains are urgently needed to supplement the use of vaccines and current antiviral treatments.</p>
<p id="P3">A promising complement to mAb therapies is cell-mimicking “decoy” systems—nanoparticles that display host cell receptors on their surface to mimic a cell and bind pathogens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> In the case of SARS-CoV-2, viral entry into a cell is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike glycoprotein (Spike) to the human protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> As the first step in the viral replication cycle, the Spike-ACE2 binding interaction represents an attractive therapeutic target. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, decoy nanoparticles may exploit this interaction by presenting ACE2 on the decoy surface to bind Spike and inhibit cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> This type of strategy has shown promise in other disease contexts, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> The decoy strategy is particularly attractive because it might be robust to evolutionary escape by pathogens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>—mutations that reduce decoy-pathogen binding affinity (i.e., potential evolutionary escape routes for the virus) will concomitantly attenuate pathogen-cell binding and thus are likely to decrease viral fitness such that these viral variants are unable to outcompete decoy-susceptible variants. Another potential advantage is that if more infectious variants evolve through increasing the affinity with which the pathogen binds a host receptor, such a variant would be equally or more susceptible to inhibition by decoys.</p>
<p id="P4">Although any particle that displays a pathogen’s cognate receptor may serve as a decoy particle, biologically-derived nanoparticles that closely resemble the natural host cell microenvironment (e.g., lipid and membrane composition) are of particular interest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> The most prominent biological nanoparticles are extracellular vesicles (EVs)—nanometer-scale particles released by all cells which mediate intercellular transfer of biomolecules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup> EVs have recently been investigated as infectious disease decoys<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> in part because, in contrast to most synthetic vehicles, EVs uniquely exhibit low toxicity and low immunogenicity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> and these properties are likely to be of central importance for particles to be administered via sustained infusions or repeat injections, as is envisioned for decoy applications. Although decoy nanoparticles have yet to be evaluated clinically, it seems likely that this approach would be most beneficial for patients experiencing severe or prolonged infections that are not controlled by either their immune system or available antiviral agents.</p>
<p id="P5">The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a flurry of decoy EV research that has dramatically advanced the decoy nanoparticle field. Initial speculation that ACE2-containing EVs might inhibit viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> was supported in early studies that demonstrated ACE2-EVs bound the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> and were capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus transduction <italic>in vitro.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>
</italic> ACE2-EV viral inhibition was later interrogated as a function of dose, providing the community the first quantitative benchmark of decoy potency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> Subsequent work demonstrated efficacy against replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>
</italic> and suggested that ACE2-EVs were safe and effective against pseudotyped virus when delivered intranasally in a rodent model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> Most recently, intravenously administered ACE2-EVs lowered the viral load of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue, and mitigated lung tissue injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> These studies validated the fundamental concept that decoy EVs could address this disease and raised a number of interesting questions. However, the diversity of experimental systems and designs employed across these studies makes it difficult to synthesize the results of these efforts to evaluate the relationship between specific EV design choices and efficacy. Moreover, we lack understanding as to how decoy EV performance varies across various emerging viral strains, which is an open question of recognized importance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> Resolving these knowledge gaps could help optimize and deploy decoy EV treatments for SARS-CoV-2, novel variants thereof, and perhaps novel viral infections.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we systematically evaluate the relationships between design features of decoy EVs and performance characteristics <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> inhibition of a model SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We compare designs across several candidate vesicle subtypes, and we generate new insights into the role of Spike-ACE2 affinity in influencing decoy efficacy. We also compare decoy EVs to an emerging, distinct class of decoy nanoparticles, termed mechanically-generated nanovesicles (NVs). Finally, we evaluate decoy EV-mediated inhibition in the context of several drug-resistant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These insights will enable future engineering of decoy nanoparticles and provide mechanistic evidence as to how decoy EVs may serve as evolutionarily robust antiviral agents.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Engineered HEK293FT cell lines express high levels of ACE2</title>
<p id="P7">To obtain ACE2-containing EVs, we first sought to generate stable cell lines overexpressing ACE2. We engineered HEK293FT cells to stably express a codon-optimized version of the wild-type ACE2 protein (WT-ACE2) via lentiviral-mediated gene delivery. In parallel, we generated a stable cell line expressing a mutant version of the ACE2 gene (Mut-ACE2) that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with higher affinity than does wild-type ACE2 (WT-ACE2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> Cell lines were analyzed for ACE2 expression, surface display, and EV loading. HEK293FTs did not endogenously express ACE2 at an appreciable level, while both engineered lines expressed high amounts of ACE2 relative to Calu-3s, a model ACE2-expressing lung cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B–C</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> Transgenic ACE2 was detected at similar levels across cell lysates from each engineered cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). We observed a small decrease in apparent molecular weight for the Mut-ACE2 construct relative to WT-ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>); this is likely a result of the T92Q mutation which deletes the NXT glycosylation motif at N90.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> Surface staining of the cell lines showed high surface expression of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>) which was capable of binding to surface-expressed Spike protein <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A–B</xref>). We subsequently utilized these engineered HEK293FTs to generate decoy vesicles containing ACE2.</p>

<title>EVs harvested from engineered HEK293FTs exhibit classical EV characteristics and contain ACE2</title>
<p id="P8">Since EVs represent a heterogenous population and various EV subsets can be distinguished by method of purification, we investigated how ACE2 loading varies amongst EV populations. We harvested EVs using differential ultracentrifugation and defined each subset by method of separation, yielding a high-speed centrifugation EV fraction (HS-EVs) and an ultracentrifugation EV fraction (UC-EVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nanoparticle tracking analysis on samples isolated using this protocol revealed two populations of similarly sized nanoparticles (~100-200 nm), which is a range consistent with reported HEK293FT-dervied EV sizes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Following established best practices for EV research,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> we confirmed that both EV preparations yield particles that exhibit an expected cup-shape morphology by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), and both subsets contained standard EV markers CD9, CD81, and Alix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The signal enrichment for CD9 and CD81 blots in UC-EVs versus HS-EVs is consistent with previous reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, both EV samples were depleted in the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin from the producer cells, confirming that our protocol separates cellular debris and EVs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> ACE2 was present in both vesicle populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We noted that a small ~18 kDa, C-terminal cleavage product was loaded into EVs along with the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure SIB,E</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup> Semi-quantitative western blot analysis indicated that, on average, each EV from cells expressing ACE2 (WT or Mut) contained between 500 and 2,500 ACE2 molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A–B</xref>). These quantities are comparable to levels reported for expression of engineered proteins on the EV surface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> WT-ACE2 HS-EVs were loaded with more ACE2 than were the rest of the vesicle subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>), and this effect may be partially attributed to the slightly larger size of HS-EVs compared to UC-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The above characterization steps validated our EV isolation protocol and confirmed the presence of ACE2 in EVs derived from engineered HEK293FTs.</p>

<title>Modification of virus-producing protocols generates high titer SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus</title>
<p id="P9">To evaluate the viral inhibitory potency of decoy EVs, we next developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> transduction assay similar to other reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> We utilized a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation lentivirus system to generate lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Spike-lenti), wherein an “infection” event causes genomic integration and expression of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter (i.e., transduction). We chose to use a flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike construct that contained a D614G mutation and lacked a 19 amino-acid C-terminal sequence because both of these choices have been reported to improve pseudotyping efficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup> We also generated model recipient cells by engineering HEK293FTs to stably express ACE2. In our hands, this combination produced a detectable but low titer of functional lentivirus: ~10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> transducing units/mL (TU/mL) evaluated on ACE2-expressing HEK293FTs compared to a typical yield of ~10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> TU/mL for a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudotyped virus applied to HEK293FT recipient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). We subsequently explored changing our viral producer cell type from HEK293FTs to HEK293T Lenti-X cells (Lenti-X, Takara), which substantially increased Spike-lenti titer from ~10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> to ~10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> TU/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Transduction by Spike-lenti was both Spike and ACE2 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Spike-lenti particles showed no loss of bioactivity after incubation at 37°C for 1 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), which is somewhat surprising given that standard VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral particles have a reported half-life of ~30 min when heated in the presence of serum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> ACE2-expressing cells were more susceptible to transduction if cells were plated at the time of transduction rather than the day prior, effectively increasing viral transduction 6-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). These optimized conditions were used in all subsequent experiments. We anticipate that the procedure reported here to improve viral titer will be useful to the SARS-CoV-2 research community and will circumvent the need for using alternate methods that increase effective viral transduction, such as spinoculation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> or adding polybrene,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>

<title>ACE2-containing EVs inhibit Spike-lenti transduction of ACE2-expressing cells in a manner robust to ACE2-Spike affinity and EV subtype</title>
<p id="P10">We next quantitatively evaluated the capacity of decoy EVs to inhibit Spike-lenti transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Two classes of EVs were prepared (HS-EVs or UC-EVs), either loaded with WT-ACE2 or Mut-ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), yielding four types of ACE2-containing EVs. All four EV types inhibited Spike-lenti transduction in an EV dose-dependent manner. To quantify the potency of these inhibitors, we calculated half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID50) values, which were on the order of 1 x 10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> particles for all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 and Table S1, S2</xref>). We note that the ID<sub>50</sub> metric enables comparisons of EV efficacy within a single assay format (and the same assay format was used throughout this study), but ID<sub>50</sub> is not an absolute measurement of potency (i.e., this metric is context-specific). Moreover, ID50 is a more appropriate metric than is the commonly used IC50 metric, since these experiments involve relatively small numbers of discrete particles (i.e., the continuum approximation does not apply). Nonetheless, we analyze both metrics for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1, S2</xref>). Interestingly, despite detectable differences in ACE2 loading between HS-EVs and UC-EVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), potency was similar between HS-EVs and UC-EVs displaying a given ACE2 variant. This finding contradicts a report in which improving ACE2 loading conferred improvements in potency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> Surprisingly, WT-ACE2 and Mut-ACE2 EVs exhibited similar potency despite an estimated 5-10 fold difference in binding affinity of the individual ACE2 variants for Spike,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> and this finding held across EV subtypes. One possible interpretation for the similar potency across all four EV-ACE2 combinations is that ACE2 loading for these EV samples is high enough that the effect of loading upon inhibitor potency has saturated (which might not have been the case in prior reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>). Control HS-EVs and UC-EVs, which lacked ACE2, had no effect on transduction efficiency, confirming that inhibition of Spike-lenti is ACE2-dependent at all doses evaluated. In addition, EV subtype did not have a meaningful impact on ID<sub>50</sub>, suggesting that vesicle type and purification method are not restrictive design choices for engineering and producing decoy vesicles.</p>
<p id="P11">Altogether, our data suggest that decoy EV potency can be relatively independent of intuitively important parameters such as Spike-ACE2 affinity and ACE2 loading levels, but these findings are intimately linked. For example, although the endogenous receptor-virus affinity is ~20-50 nM for WT-ACE2 and Spike<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, our particles are loaded with &gt; 500 ACE2 proteins per EV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A–B</xref>), such that the effective avidity of the Spike-lenti-EV interaction is much tighter. These findings should be interpreted in the context of our EV production strategy, where we used a codon-optimized ACE2 gene from a strong promoter (CMV) that is well-suited to the host cell. Altogether these analyses also suggest that it might be possible to generate high potency decoy EVs via a variety of approaches provided that the decoy protein is loaded in sufficient quantity.</p>

<title>Mechanically generated membrane nanovesicles display similar physical characteristics to EVs and inhibit Spike-lenti in an ACE2-dependent manner</title>
<p id="P12">Given the design principles elucidated thus far, we investigated whether other decoy particles could be generated with similar potency using alternative manufacturing approaches, such as lysing ACE2-expressing cells to create membrane nanovesicles (NVs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup> One reported benefit of using NVs rather than EVs is that NV manufacturing may yield more vesicles per producer cell in a shorter amount of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup> NVs were generated from WT-ACE2 HEK293FTs via osmotic lysis, sonication, and differential ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup> The final membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS and extruded through 100 nm filters to generate ACE2 NVs. Particles exhibited a similar mean size to EVs, although the NV size distribution was narrower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To generate a baseline of protein markers for comparing NVs to EVs, we performed western blots against standard EV markers as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Little to no appreciable CD9, CD81, calnexin or Alix were detectable in NVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). ACE2 loading into NVs was also confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Semi-quantitative western blots demonstrated that NVs contained less ACE2 per vesicle than HS-EVs but similar ACE2 per vesicle to UC-EVs derived from WT-ACE2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-B</xref>). NVs also exhibited a general cup-shape morphology by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), although several NVs displayed internal structures not observed in EVs, which might suggest the presence of multilamellar vesicles in NVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). In our hands, NVs were faster to generate compared to EVs (2-3 days versus 4-5 days, respectively), but particle yields per engineered producer cell seeded were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>). Because WT-ACE2 and Mut-ACE2 EVs similarly inhibited Spike-lenti in earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), we chose to evaluate NVs using only WT-ACE2. Interestingly, NV decoy potency was remarkably similar to that observed for decoy EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8 and Table S3, S4</xref>). These findings indicate that potent cell-derived decoy nanoparticles can be generated with a variety of biological vesicle subtypes and manufacturing and isolation methods.</p>

</sup> and we decided to first focus our investigation on variants that have demonstrated resistance to drugs that interfere with the Spike-ACE2 interaction, including mAb or sACE2 inhibitors. We identified two Spike mutants that confer such resistance compared to the parental D614G Spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The first mutant contains the SARS-CoV-2 Beta strain’s receptor binding domain (RBD) (Beta), which has three mutations that abolish inhibition by several mAb treatments which are under development or have been authorized by the FDA.<sup>

</sup>’ <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup> This naturally-evolved viral strain represents a clinically relevant example of a drug-resistant viral strain. The second mutant comprises a point mutation, F486S, that abrogates inhibition by sACE2, likely by altering the Spike RBD and affecting ACE2 receptor engagement (F486S).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup> Although this mutation has not been reported in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, sACE2 treatments currently under development would likely be ineffective against a strain that has or develops this mutation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup> We cloned the aforementioned mutants into the same backbone as our D614G (parental) Spike protein and generated Spike-lenti for each variant.</p>
<p id="P14">We then evaluated the ability of WT-ACE2 UC-EVs, Mut-ACE2 UC-EVs, and sACE to inhibit this panel of Spike-lenti variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9 and Table S5-8</xref>). For each treatment, we defined a metric of resistance by dividing the ID<sub>50</sub> value for the strain considered by the ID<sub>50</sub> value of a reference, parental strain (in this case, D614G); we term this metric “relative resistance.” A relative resistance value of one indicates that the Spike-lenti variant is equally susceptible to the decoy EV (compared to the reference Spike-lenti), a value less than one indicates that this variant is less resistant to the decoy EV, and a value greater than one indicates that this variant is more resistant to the decoy EV. Relative resistance is defined to facilitate quantitative comparison across strains and treatments by minimizing dependency on virus-to-virus variability (e.g., slight titer differences between samples of virus with different mutations) which can impact ID<sub>50</sub>s. Relative resistance is also useful because it enables comparison across treatments which might be defined in distinct natural units of concentration (e.g., number of vesicles versus mass of sACE2). To evaluate whether any differences in decoy potency were due to different viral titers across viral strains, we also calculated ID<sub>50</sub>s normalized to the viral quantity added (ID<sub>50</sub>/TU) and a relative resistance calculated from ID<sub>50</sub>/TU metrics (relative resistance-TU normalized) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5 and S7</xref>. Following expected patterns, sACE2 was equally effective against Beta relative to the parental strain, while sACE2 was ~50 fold less effective against sACE2-resistant F486S Spike-lenti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). A particularly promising finding that contrasts with the sACE2 analysis is that all Spike variants analyzed exhibited a relative resistance below 1 for both decoy EV treatments (WT-ACE2 or Mut-ACE2 EVs). Thus, decoy EV potency was robust to Spike mutations known to disrupt the Spike-ACE2 interaction. These data provide the first evidence in a SARS-CoV-2 context that decoy vesicles inhibit viral mutants that are resistant to clinically authorized mAb treatments. Furthermore, these data provide evidence that vesicles displaying wild-type host cell receptors are capable of potently inhibiting viral strains that prove refractory to soluble, protein-based therapeutics. Importantly, this approach circumvents the need for separately engineering a Spike-binding protein in a manner that could be immunogenic and problematic, particularly in the context of sustained or repeated administration.</p>
<p id="P15">Given the promising activity of WT-ACE2 EVs against our test strains (which are not prevalent globally), we next sought to extend our investigation to naturally emerging and prominent Spike mutants. In particular, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly became the dominant strain due to high transmissibility and resistance to mAb and vaccine-induced sera neutralization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>’ <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> A closely related strain, Delta-plus, demonstrates a similarly high resistance to antibody neutralization and exhibits a marked reduction in affinity for ACE2 relative to wild-type Spike (4-8 fold);<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup> this combination of drug resistance properties integrates features of both the F486S and Beta strain previously investigated. The emerging Lambda variant is less well-studied, but preprints suggest high transmissibility and moderate immune evasion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup> Spike-lenti containing the RBD mutations for these variants was generated as follows: Delta (L452R, T478K), Delta-plus: (K417N, L452R, T478K), and Lambda (L452Q, F490S). Viral inhibition experiments were performed with WT-ACE2 UC-EVs using the parental D614G strain as the reference strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>). Notably, the relative resistances of these emerging strains were all below 1, indicating that WT-ACE2 EVs are potent inhibitors of both current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.</p>
<p id="P16">We speculate that avidity is largely responsible for the efficacy of decoy nanoparticles and confers advantages in terms of potency and robustness to drug resistance compared to soluble receptor protein decoys. Given our estimated levels of ACE2 loading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A–B</xref>), our decoy particles contain approximately one ACE2 molecule per 200-500 nm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> area of exposed outer membrane, on average. This density of ACE2 display could theoretically facilitate the binding of a decoy vesicle to a virion at several attachment points (e.g., multiple Spike-ACE2 interactions per virion). We hypothesize that the lipid bilayer structure of vesicles enables decoy ACE2 receptors to diffuse across the vesicle surface and improve their likelihood of encountering a Spike protein <italic>in trans,</italic> particularly after an initial vesicle-virion contact has occurred. It is interesting to speculate that decoy particles that contain a fluid bilayer membrane may possess advantages—in terms of either avidity or inhibition mechanism—over nanoparticle systems with fixed protein-attachment points,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup> but this possibility requires further investigation. By comparing ID<sub>50</sub> values for vesicle-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>)—expressed on a per molecule of ACE2 basis—to ID<sub>50</sub> values for sACE2-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>), we indeed observed evidence of avidity increasing the potency of EVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6, S8</xref>). For example, considering the Beta variant Spike-lenti, WT-ACE2 UC-EVs were 51-fold more effective than was sACE2 on a per molecule of ACE2 basis, and Mut-ACE2 UC-EVs were 22-fold more effective than sACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). This trend also holds for the parental viral strain. This benefit of avidity agrees qualitatively with a previous report comparing sACE2 to ACE2 EVs, but that study found even stronger differences—ACE2-containing EV s were found to be 500-1500 more potent than sACE2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> Differences in experimental setup and the definition of key metrics (e.g., potency, ID<sub>50</sub>) likely account for these quantitative differences, highlighting the importance of evaluating any given design choice using apples-to-apples comparisons. The efficacy of high-avidity particles to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants mirrors observations with HIV,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> suggesting that this phenomenon could indeed be a general advantage for this type of antiviral inhibitor. An interesting structural consideration is that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein quaternary structure is a trimer with three receptor binding domains; all of which may be bound to ACE2 at the same time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P17">In this study, we demonstrated that decoy nanoparticles, in the form of ACE2-displaying vesicles, potently inhibit model SARS-CoV-2 viruses bearing drug resistant variants of the Spike protein. We also show that multiple variations of vesicle-based decoys are equally effective <italic>in vitro,</italic> independent of the vesicle subtype or the binding affinity between viral glycoprotein and host cell receptor. Together, these findings suggest that effective inhibitory nanoparticles can be developed using only knowledge of the host cell receptor target of a particular virus. This comparative evaluation informs future preclinical evaluations of this promising approach for potentially treating a wide array of infectious diseases.</p>

The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The medium was replaced the morning after transfection and cells were incubated for an additional 32 h prior to harvesting unless otherwise stated. In some cases, medium was replaced, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h, and virus was harvested a second time. Conditioned medium containing lentivirus was harvested, clarified via centrifugation at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min at 4°C, and purified through a 0.45 um polyethersulfone filter (VWR #28143-505). Where required, Spike-lenti was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units with a 100 kDa cutoff (Millipore Sigma #UFC910024). Samples were centrifuged at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26XP centrifuge using either a J-LITE JLA 16.25 rotor or a JA-14.5 rotor at 5,000g until concentrated approximately 10-50 fold (generally 10-20 min) and stored on ice at 4°C for up to 1 week or at -80°C until use. To determine functional viral titer, unless otherwise stated, virus was diluted in DMEM and pipetted into a 96 well plate, centrifuged at 500g for 1 min at 4°C to remove bubbles, immediately incubated at 37°C for 1 h. WT-ACE2<sup>+</sup> HEK23FTs were trypsinized briefly, counted, and 4x10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> cells were plated on top of the virus such that the final volume was 200 μL. After 16 h, media was aspirated and 200 μL fresh DMEM was added. Cells were harvested for flow cytometry 3 days after inoculation.</p>

<p id="P32">Vesicles or soluble ACE2 (Sino Biological, 10108-H08H, resuspended in sterile, nuclease-free H2O at 0.25 mg/mL) were serially diluted in DMEM. Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus was added to each sample at a projected MOI between 0.02 -0.15 and mixed with pipetting. 175 μL of the mixed sample were transferred to TC-treated 96 well plates, centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min at 4°C to remove bubbles, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. WT-ACE2 expressing HEK293FTs were briefly trypsinized (&lt; 1 min), quenched with DMEM, and counted. Cells were diluted in DMEM and added to plates such that 4 x 10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> cells were plated per well in 25 μL media resulting in 200 μL media total per well. Approximately 16 h later, the media was replaced with 200 μL fresh DMEM and the cells were cultured for an additional two days (~72 h post inoculation). Cells were harvested for flow cytometry via trypsin, quenched with phenol red-free DMEM, and diluted with at least 5 volumes of FACS buffer in FACS tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 150 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was decanted, and the samples were stored at 4°C until flow cytometry analysis.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry and analysis</title>
<p id="P33">Analytical flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSR Fortessa Special Order Research Product (Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core); EYFP expression and Alexa Fluor® 488 staining was measured using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel from a 488 nm excitation laser and captured using a 505 nm long pass filter and a 530/30 nm bandpass filter. Approximately 5,000-10,000 single cells were analyzed for each sample on FlowJo software v10. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>, cells were identified using side scatter versus forward scatter gating, and singlets were isolated using forward scatter-height versus forward scatter-area. In transduction experiments, cells without viral treatment were used as a fluorescent gating control such that &lt; 0.5% of these cells were gated as EYFP+. The output metric for each sample in such experiments was percent of single cells that were transduced (EYFP+). In dose-response curve experiments, the percent of transduced cells for a given treatment was normalized by the percent of transduced cells determined from that treatment’s largest dilution as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup> Curves were then fit with a four parameter, nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 9.2. Convergence criteria was set to “Strict” with 10,000 maximum iterations, and the regression was constrained as follows: “Bottom” = 0, “Top” = 100, “IC50” &gt; 0.</p>

<p>Engineering effective decoy vesicles requires evaluating key design choices. Human cells may be engineered to release vesicles that neutralize virus and inhibit infection. Here, we investigate important open questions as to how general design choices influence the efficacy of decoy vesicle-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to what extent this inhibition is robust to mutations that could confer viral escape.</p>

B) Representative histogram of nanoparticle tracking analysis of HEK293FT EV subpopulations normalized to the modal value in each population. C) Transmission electron microscopy images of representative EV subpopulations. Scale bar represents 100 nm. D) Western blots of EVs evaluating standard markers CD9, CD81, and Alix, and a blot of EVs and cell lysate evaluting the potentially contaminating endoplasmic reticulum protein, calnexin. E) Western blot against the C-terminal HA-tag of transgenic ACE2 in EV populations from parental or engineered cell lines. Western blots were normalized by vesicle count (for EVs). The Calnexin western blot comparing lysate to EVs used the same number of EVs per well as for CD9, CD81, and Alix and 3 μg cell lysate.</p>

<title>ACE2-containing EVs inhibit pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 transduction.</title>
<p>A) Cartoon depicting pseudotype lentivirus assay. Transduction of ACE2<sup>+</sup> HEK293FT cells by SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virus (Spike-lenti) results in expression of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) as a reporter of viral entry. B) Representative relative frequency histograms of EYFP expression of ACE2<sup>+</sup> or parental HEK293 FT cells after exposure to no virus, mock virus (no surface glycprotein), or Spike-pseudotyped virus. C) Cartoon depicting pseudotype lentivirus inhibition assay. Effective inhibitors of viral transduction reduce the number of cells expressing EYFP. D) Dose-response curve demonstrating the relationship between EV dose and normalized percentage of cells transduced by Spike-lenti. Curves are normalized to the percent of cells transduced at the lowest EV dose in a particular curve. Symbols repesent the mean of three biological replicates except for the ACE2 negative, HS-EV condition, where the third and fourth dilutions in series are the mean of two biological replicates. Error bars are standard error of the mean. Data are representative of two independent experiments.</p>
