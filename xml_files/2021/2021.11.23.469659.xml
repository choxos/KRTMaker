The mechanism of how viruses sense environmental changes associated with host entry to prime them for disassembly is unknown. We have applied a combination of mass spectrometry, cryo-EM, and simulation-assisted structure refinement to Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), which serves as a model non-enveloped icosahedral virus (Triangulation number = 3, 180 copies/icosahedron). Our results reveal genomic RNA tightly binds a subset of viral coat proteins to form a stable RNA-capsid core which undergoes conformational switching in response to host- specific environmental changes. These changes include: i) Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> which triggers viral particle expansion ii) Increase in osmolytes further disrupt interactions of outer coat proteins from the RNA-capsid core to promote complete viral disassembly. A cryo-EM structure of the expanded particle shows that RNA is asymmetrically extruded from a single 5-fold axis during disassembly. The genomic RNA:capsid protein interactions confer metastability to the TCV capsid and drive release of RNA from the disassembling virion within the plant host cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Icosahedral viruses are ubiquitous macromolecular assemblies, consisting of protein capsids encapsidating nucleic acid genomes. Capsids function to shield the viral genome and undergo programmed disassembly in favorable host environments in order to release the genome for replication inside the target host cell. Coat proteins that form the capsid thus function as metastable sensors of environmental conditions through reversible ‘breathing’ motions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and can be likened to delivery vehicles of genetic material transmitted from one host to another. Cryo- electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has provided high resolution snapshots of virus icosahedral geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. However, static structural snapshots cannot capture intrinsic breathing dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] of the virus particle, and largely report on more structured elements of the virus particle and offer only limited insights into the interior of the viral particle.</p><p id="P3">Whole viral particle dynamics are fundamental to understanding a virus’s structural responses to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Viruses are programmed to sense and respond to unique host specific physical perturbations such as changes in osmolyte concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], or chemical perturbations such as changes in divalent cation concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Currently, viral recognition and responses to host environments is poorly understood. Here, we describe the intrinsic dynamics of virus particles and changes in conformation associated with host-specific environments <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p id="P4">We selected Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a plant RNA icosahedral virus model for mapping changes in viral particle conformation and dynamics across varying plant host-specific environments. TCV offers numerous advantages: It is a simple non-enveloped virus lacking lipids and post-translational glycosylation modifications and consists entirely of copies of a viral capsid coat protein (38 kDa) arranged in T=3 icosahedral symmetry and encapsulating a 4.1 kb ssRNA genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Each coat protein subunit consists of domains – an N-terminal RNA binding (R) domain, a Shell (S) domain, and a C-terminal Protruding (P) domain. This basic unit consists of a trimer of quasi equivalent conformations - A, B and C - that differ in their hinge angles between the S and P domains and folding of the connecting arm linking R and S domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Upon entry into a host plant cell, TCV undergoes preferential disassembly to release genomic RNA into the associated high osmolyte environment with concomitant depletion of divalent Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the host cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). Release of viral RNA without complete disassembly has also been observed whereby chelation of divalent Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions results in a large expansion in particle size (disassembly intermediate). Subsequent proteolytic processing of the expanded viral particle by host proteases facilitates ribosomal-mediated extrusion (striposomal release) of genomic RNA into the plant host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Cryo-EM structures of the native virus and expanded disassembly intermediates have previously been solved at low resolution (11 and 18 Å respectively). These structures show a disordered arm in the A and B conformations and more folded structure in the C conformation. The A subunits form the 5-fold axis, while the B and C subunits form the 3-fold (or quasi 6-fold) axis. The arms of the C subunit form a beta annulus structure at the 3-fold axis that has been postulated to be involved in RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P6">To obtain additional insights into the interior of the virus particle, we have carried out orthogonal cryo-EM, simulation-assisted structure refinement, and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) analysis of the different states of TCV. HDXMS is a powerful technique that can be used to identify regions involved in conformational changes within a protein, and within protein-protein, protein-lipid, protein-ligand or protein-nucleic acid interfaces by reporting on hydrogen bonding and solvent accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. HDXMS also allows detection of multiple conformational populations in solution and has been combined with variable urea denaturation to estimate the relative strengths of the icosahedral viral assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P7">We report a high resolution (3.2 Å) map that clearly shows the asymmetry in the interior of the TCV particle and captures TCV in the process of releasing its genomic RNA into the host plant cell. While the icosahedral geometry can be clearly described at this resolution, the specific RNA-R domain binding interactions inside the whole virus particle are still unresolved and reflect a highly dynamic interior, corroborated by HDXMS. Our findings further reveal a highly disordered R-domain that is composed of genomic RNA-tightly bound (~5.7%) capsid protein. Significantly, a majority of the capsid protein (~94.3%) is only loosely bound to the genomic RNA-capsid core. The basis for the TCV virion assembly lies in a subset of the capsid protein population binding strongly to RNA to generate a ribonucleoprotein core capable of nucleating assembly of many more capsid protein units to generate an icosahedral particle. The intrinsic metastability of native TCV is explained by the interplay between the small subset of strong capsid RNA interactions holding together the RNA-capsid core and weaker capsid interactions maintaining the icosahedral geometry. Far from being a passive entity, the genomic RNA-capsid core complex is the ‘controller switch’ for virus assembly-disassembly transitions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>R domain of coat protein shows greatest relative deuterium exchange</title><p id="P8">HDXMS of TCV at t = 1, 10 and 30 min, covering the fast deuterium exchange kinetic timescales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. 61 peptides with high signal to noise spanning the entire TCV coat protein with 89.2% sequence coverage were obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Of the three domains, the R domain showed the greatest magnitude exchange while the S and P domains showed lower relative exchange overall, consistent with the R domain being the least structurally ordered domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>).

These were deconvolved using HDExaminer 3.0 as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The low exchanging population showed no increases in exchange with time while the mass spectral envelope of the higher exchanging population shifted to the right in the deuteration times examined.

We report peptide 66-89 as a reference peptide to quantitate the abundance of low and high exchanging populations in native TCV, which was consistent with other R domain peptides.

Differences in exchange between the expanded and native TCV particles are represented as a deuterium exchange difference plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Increases in exchange were observed predominantly in the S domain. These regions exhibiting increases in exchange greater than 0.5 D are indicated in red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Increases in exchange observed at peptides spanning 170-176 and 196-208 of the S domain correspond to the region flanking the quasi 3-fold axis which shows increases in solvent accessibility, confirming particle expansion. This can be observed through shifts in the mass centroids of spectral envelopes from the native to the expanded state in representative peptide 150- 159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).

The higher exchanging population in both states showed comparable average deuterium exchange (~12.7 Da) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Expansion elicits conformational rearrangements in RNP</title><p id="P12">There are two possible explanations for the bimodal isotopic envelopes observed within the mass spectra of deuterated peptides from the R domain. Either the R domain populates a more folded and ordered conformation (low exchanging), and a disordered conformation (high exchanging) which would be consistent with EX1 kinetics of HD exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], or the two populations reflect a differential effect of the RNA genome on the R domain. To identify the two populations of TCV capsid protein R domain in solution, we disassembled TCV by chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> through addition of EDTA and introducing high osmolality (&gt;500 mM NaCl). SDS-PAGE gels of limited chymotrypsin proteolysis of TCV in the presence of 250/500 mM NaCl indicated complete cleavage of the 38 kDa coat protein to the 30 kDa cleavage product confirming complete disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We next resolved the two conformations with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) broadly into two fractions consisting of RNA bound TCV coat protein (RNA-capsid core-complex) and the RNA-free TCV coat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This allowed comparative HDXMS of a disassembled and chromatographically resolved higher molecular weight fraction containing genomic RNA-capsid core-complex alone, disassembled TCV, and native virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The RNA-bound fraction showed low deuterium exchange for the R domain peptides while the RNA-free fraction corresponded to the higher exchanging population. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the mass spectra of deuterium exchanged peptide (66-89) for the two fractions in the disassembled virus in comparison to native TCV. The isotopic envelope of the RNA bound population (Peak 1) can be seen corresponding to the lower exchanging envelope in the corresponding native virus. TCV incubated with 500 mM NaCl contains a mixture of both high and low exchanging populations (Peaks 1 and 2) and the low exchanging population corresponds to the lower exchange in the RNA-capsid core-complex implying that the low exchanging population in the native virus particle represented the proportion of the R domain tightly bound to genomic RNA.</p><p id="P14">Importantly, the higher exchanging population of the native state showed lower deuterium exchange compared to free coat protein from the disassembled virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). This indicated that the higher exchanging population represented the fraction of R domain peripherally bound to the genomic RNA in the native particle, which is disrupted by high salt, leading to disassembly of TCV into the RNA-capsid core-complex and free TCV coat proteins. While mass spectra of all the deuterium exchanged R domain peptides allowed an estimate (~13.6%) of the relative abundance of RNA-bound and free coat protein, the mass spectra of deuterium exchanged peptide 66-89 alone allowed the most accurate quantitation to a baseline resolution estimate of the relative abundance of RNA-bound and RNA-free TCV coat protein (S2 Table).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structure of Expanded TCV at 3.2 Å resolution shows RNA primed for release at 5’ fold axis</title><p id="P15">In order to establish if R-domain interactions with genomic RNA were uniformly distributed across the expanded TCV particle, we solved the structure of expanded TCV, generated at pH 5.4 using molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. While a structure of expanded TCV has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], it has been solved at low resolution (~17Å) and offers limited insights of the interior of the virus particle containing the more dynamic core of the virus containing genomic RNA and associated capsid.</p><p id="P16">During MD simulations of the complete viral particle, an additional biasing potential based on the cryo-EM map was applied. Forces proportional to the gradient of the density map trigger the gradual transition of the structure towards the experimental map. The native TCV coordinates solved at pH 7.4 (PDB: 3ZX8) were used as the starting point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Initial fitting with the TCV at pH 5.4 density map determined at ~3.2 Å resulted in a correlation of ~0.41 (see Methods for details). We next trimmed the low pH map around the TCV trimeric subunit made of the 3 quasi equivalent conformations A, B and C in their native state, and then applied MDFF to progressively fit the structure into the map over 50 ns of simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). Following the MDFF procedure, the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the trimer was measured with respect to the final expanded coordinates, without least-squares fitting, revealing a gradual reduction in RMSD from ~7 to Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A Fig</xref>). This reflected an overall translational motion of the trimer during radial expansion of the capsid. However, the trimer retained its native structure and interface; when performing a least-squares fit of the final conformation compared to the initial structure, a lower backbone RMSD of ~3.2 Å was measured, thus retaining the close proximity of key acidic residues at the quasi 3-fold axis that coordinate Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The final fitted trimeric coordinates were aligned onto the 60 subunits of the initial TCV model. This resulted in an accurate model for the expanded state of the virus, as evidenced by a correlation measured with respect to the low pH density map of ~0.80, representing a significant improvement in comparison to the initial fit (~0.41). The final coordinates together with the corresponding cryo-EM density map of the expanded TCV at low pH are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). This reveals not only a larger diameter of the capsid when compared to the native structure, but interestingly asymmetric packing at the 5-fold axes with the pentamers protruding outwards from the TCV. Importantly, the protrusion point is likely the single copy of the covalently bound p80 dimer. The p80 dimer is preferentially labelled by I<sup>125</sup>, showing it to be on the surface. It is additionally part of the RNA-bound core protein, implicated as the last segment of RNA to undergo condensation during assembly and correspondingly, the first RNA-coat protein segment to be released from the viral particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. This reveals the asymmetric packing of RNA within the TCV virion and allows visualization of a viral RNA genome in the process of release. Even at a 3.2 Å resolution we were unable to capture the structure of the RNA within the particle indicating that the genomic RNA in the interior of the particle is highly dynamic. The increased proportion of RNA-bound R domain can be attributed to enhanced interactions mediated by protruding RNA at the 5’ fold site with proximal R domain.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A stable RNP complex is retained upon complete TCV disassembly in the presence of osmolyte</title><p id="P18">The expanded particle undergoes full disassembly upon addition of osmolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). To map changes accompanying disassembly, we carried out HDXMS in three osmolyte (NaCl) concentrations (100 mM, 250 mM, and 500 mM). We observed increased exchange in the high exchanging population of the R domain (peptide 66-89 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A Fig</xref>) and at the 5-fold/3fold axis (peptide 135-154 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B Fig</xref>) corresponding to particle disassembly. At 250 mM NaCl the TCV particle showed nearly complete disassembly as shown in the difference plot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C Figure</xref>. Interestingly, the low exchanging RNA bound fraction of R domain did not show significantly increased exchange under high osmolyte conditions, suggesting that the RNP complex is maintained upon complete disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A Fig</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Viruses are evolutionarily built to encounter multiple environments within and outside hosts during their lifecycle. Abiotic changes such as temperature, pH, osmolyte, and divalent cations can all serve as indicators for the virus while seeking favorable conditions for disassembly. RNA viruses including Dengue, flaviviruses and the common cold undergo dynamic breathing motions in order to modulate behavior under these changing conditions and to help evade host defences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. A holistic view is needed to account for the contributions of the structure of the viral particle as well the dynamic changes that occur in the disordered interior. We have uniquely carried out doing dynamics measurements with HDXMS in conjunction with orthogonal cryo-EM. This combination allows for a complete view of viral response to environmental perturbations. The RNA-protein interface is a critical and poorly understood component of viral dynamics. TCV has no lipids and no glycosylation modifications offering a deeper view into the role of RNA-protein interactions in viral disassembly. The simplicity of TCV means that the viral capsid protein must have an inbuilt efficiency in order to function in many roles including as a scaffold for genomic RNA and as a sensor for environmental perturbations. We have outlined the changes in TCV capsid protein during disassembly where the particle responds to changes in divalent cations and osmolyte in host plant cells during disassembly. Viruses are highly dynamic biomolecular entities undergoing molecular motions of varying timescales that facilitate replication within host cells. This study has offered key insights into the virus interior that is structurally poorly resolved and has revealed the key sensors of viral metastability at the RNA-R domain interface. From cryo-EM, it was predicted that genomic RNA mediates strong interactions with ~30% of the coat protein R domains, potentially correlated with the formation of the folded arm of the C quasi equivalent conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Our results reveal that the R domain provides the main interface for RNA binding and presents a more accurate smaller percentage of 5.7% being RNA-bound in native TCV. This represents the RNA-bound capsid core of TCV. The remaining relatively free coat protein in the (~94.3%) fraction is loosely bound to the RNA-capsid protein core in native TCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p id="P20">These results reveal the critical importance of the genomic RNA capsid protein complex to function as a sensor for the host environment. Increased osmolyte and decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the host environment disrupts weak contacts between the capsid and RNA genome during expansion. Conformational changes in the genomic RNA-capsid core lead to the detection of a major (~86.4%) unbound population of R domain, and a minor (~15%) strongly bound population of R domain in the expanded particle. This conformational change primes the RNA for future release. Release can then occur <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of high osmolality (500 mM NaCl) which leads to continued association of the RNA-capsid core. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the primed RNA genome is extruded from the expanded particle by cellular ribosomes as was shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P21">Our cryo-EM analysis has revealed that the genomic RNA-capsid interactions are not equally distributed throughout the expanded particle. Instead, an asymmetric packaging was observed with a protrusion point a one specific 5-fold axis that also likely represents the covalent p80 dimer. Additionally, increased density from the interior of the particle can be seen near this protrusion point. The covalent dimer is also part of the genome capsid core during assembly, suggesting that the genomic RNA acts as a nucleation point for the RNA capsid core during assembly. This RNA-capsid core is then maintained in the whole viral particle and mediates viral metastability and environmental sensing. During the disassembly process, the RNA directs extrusion toward one specific 5-fold axis.</p><p id="P22">These results underscore the significance of RNA structure and conformational dynamics of RNA-capsid cores in viral sensing and disassembly. We have tracked dynamics of TCV through the entire particle disassembly process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). During disassembly, the TCV particle goes through an expanded intermediate state upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletions. TCV particle expansion also corresponds to an increase in the fraction of tightly bound RNA-R domain and conformational changes in the RNA-capsid core. Under high osmolyte conditions, the virion is disassembled into the RNA-capsid core (15% of the total coat protein) and free coat protein. In the host cell environment, ribosomes along with protease activity extrude the emerging RNA during disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The principles governing how RNA self assembles and disassembles upon sensing the optimal environmental cues are still to be understood. However, it is clear that the genomic RNA is in fact not a passively packaged entity but instead plays a key role throughout the TCV viral lifecycle as an environmental sensor and a driving force behind viral disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Purification of virus particles and size exclusion chromatography</title><p id="P23">Native TCV particle purification was adapted based on a protocol described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].

Summary</title></caption><p>RNA viruses including coronaviruses, dengue, influenza, and HIV are a significant threat to human health. These viral particles are finely tuned to undergo complex conformational changes that allow for response to varied environments. Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) serves as an excellent model for studying RNA virus dynamics. Since TCV is non-enveloped and has no post- translational modifications, we can specifically investigate the contributions of RNA to viral dynamics. Genomic RNA is not a passive entity but plays a crucial and previously uncharacterized role in viral disassembly. Our results reveal that the genomic RNA-capsid core serves as an environmental sensor and undergoes conformational switching in response to host cell conditions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Changes in Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) particle upon host entry.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Environmental changes associated with passive entry of TCV into a plant host include decreases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased osmolality, which trigger disassembly of the TCV viral particle to release viral genomic RNA for replication.
