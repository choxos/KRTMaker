<abstract>
<p id="P1">Epidemiological data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 are more transmissible and infections are associated with a higher mortality than non-VOC virus infections. Phenotypic properties underlying their enhanced spread in the human population remain unknown. B.1.1.7 virus isolates displayed inferior or equivalent spread in most cell lines and primary cells compared to an ancestral B.1 SARS-CoV-2, and were outcompeted by the latter. Lower infectivity and delayed entry kinetics of B.1.1.7 viruses were accompanied by inefficient proteolytic processing of spike. B.1.1.7 viruses failed to escape from neutralizing antibodies, but slightly dampened induction of innate immunity. The bronchial cell line NCI-H1299 supported 24- and 595-fold increased growth of B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 viruses, respectively, in the absence of detectable ACE2 expression and in a spike-determined fashion. Superior spread in NCI-H1299 cells suggests that VOCs employ a distinct set of cellular cofactors that may be unavailable in standard cell lines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Since its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has genetically diversified, giving rise to variants with altered phenotypic properties (Rambaut et al. 2020). In May 2021 the WHO announced a scheme for labeling SARS-CoV-2 lineages with evidence for increased transmissibility, severity, and escape from immunity <italic>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/">https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/</ext-link>)</italic>. The B.1.1.7 lineage was labeled Alpha as it was the first variant of concern (VOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">O’Toole et al., 2021</xref>). First detected in the United Kingdom in September 2020 (<italic>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563">https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563</ext-link>)</italic>, it shows a 50-100% higher reproduction number than previously circulating virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Volz et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the estimated hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% higher than with pre-existing variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davies et al., 2021</xref>). B.1.617.2 was identified in India in October 2020 and was labelled VOC Delta in May 2021. In July 2021, the ECDC reported an increase of weekly COVID-19 cases observed in 20 European countries of 64.3%. Delta is the currently predominant circulating strain.</p>
<p id="P3">Genetic hallmarks of B.1.1.7 comprise a set of mutations resulting in nonsynonymous changes within the spike gene including deletion of amino acids 69, 70 and 144 in the amino-terminal domain, an N<sup>501</sup>Y exchange in the receptor-binding domain, an A<sup>570</sup>D exchange in subdomain 1, P<sup>681</sup>H and T<sup>716</sup>I exchanges in the proximity of the furin cleavage site and the S1 / S2 domain junction, as well as S<sup>982</sup>A and D<sup>1118</sup>H in the S2 domain. In addition to SNPs in ORF1ab and nucleoprotein, ORF8 in variant B.1.1.7. contains a premature stop codon. The functional role of ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. A variant with deleted ORF8 that circulated in Singapore during spring 2020 showed limited evidence for changes in <italic>in-vitro</italic> transcription profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gamage et al., 2020</xref>) and clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Young et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">To date, a functional correlate for the enhanced transmission and pathogenicity of B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 is missing. Studies of viral loads demonstrated that B.1.1.7- and B.1.617.2-infected individuals shed viral RNA of increased levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and for prolonged time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kissler et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ong et al., 2021</xref>). Individual mutations in B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 spike have been investigated with regards to protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> ACE2-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ramanathan et al., 2021</xref>), spike processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lubinski et al., 2021a</xref>) and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Motozono et al., 2021</xref>), as well as fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Motozono et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to B.617.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hoffmann et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Mlcochova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Planas et al., 2021</xref>), B.1.1.7 displays only modest, if any, alteration of sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hoffmann et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Widera et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a limited contribution of antibody-dependent immune escape to the observed phenotype of B.1.1.7. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of B.1.1.7 was found to differ depending on the model used. Some epithelial cell cultures and hamster models showed equal, slightly superior, or inferior replication for B.1.1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brown et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nuñez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Touret et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ulrich et al., 2021</xref>), while B.1.1.7 generally exhibited marginally superior replication in primates and ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosenke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ulrich et al., 2021</xref>). However, animal models may be limited in their capability to reflect adaptive processes that occur in a virus establishing endemicity in humans. Here, we studied the replication of B.1.1.7 viruses in different cell and organ models as well as dwarf hamsters, and identified a human cell line that reflects the replicative phenotype of B.1.1.7 as well as of B.1.617.2.</p>

<title>B.1 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 display similar replication kinetics in immortalized cell lines</title>
<p id="P5">We first studied virus replication kinetics in a panel of immortalized cell lines. Compared to an early lineage (Non-VOC) B.1 strain carrying the D<sup>614</sup>G mutation (BavPat1/2020, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wölfel et al., 2020</xref>)), two different clade B.1.1.7 isolates displayed smaller plaque size three days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and a delayed manifestation of cytopathogenic effects (CPE) in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies</xref>), accompanied by a delay in infectious particle production during the initial 40 hours post-infection of Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Unlike Vero E6 cells, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells express the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) and are capable of producing type I interferons (IFNs). They supported the growth of B.1. equally or more efficiently than B.1.1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). Interestingly, B.1.1.7 production was particularly delayed in the very early phase of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Cultivation of infected cells at 32°C in order to resemble the temperature in the upper respiratory tract did not alter relative replication efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Under competitive passaging in Calu-3 cells, B.1 outcompeted B.1.1.7, even when the starting inoculum contained a nine-fold excess of B.1.1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). In sum, immortalized cell models failed to establish a clear growth advantage of B.1.1.7 that correlates with its enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Absence of detectable fitness advantages of B.1.1.7 in primary human respiratory cells, organoids and hamsters</title>

<title>B.1.1.7 spike protein shows decreased proteolytic processing</title>
<p id="P8">To identify potential consequences of B.1.1.7 spike mutations on expression and proteolytic processing of the glycoprotein, we analyzed lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike-HA. Overall expression levels of spike constructs encoding individual or all B.1.1.7-specific mutations did not differ significantly from B.1 constructs in quantitative immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, quantification of the proportion of S2-HA spike relative to the total spike-HA signal revealed a 1.8-fold reduction of proteolytic processing of the B.1.1.7 glycoprotein compared to that of B.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). No single B.1.1.7-defining mutation, including P<sup>681</sup>H, fully recapitulated this property, even though deletion of H<sup>69</sup>/V<sup>70</sup> showed a trend towards more efficient processing, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Meng et al., 2021</xref>), and T<sup>716</sup>H showed a trend towards decreased proteolytic processing. The data suggest that a combination of amino acid exchanges is required for rendering proteolytic processing of B.1.1.7 spike less efficient. Reduced processing of B.1.1.7 spike was accompanied by a 2.3-fold decrease of spike levels associated with lentiviral particles, when compared to particles containing B.1 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the individual T<sup>716</sup>H mutation was sufficient for reduction of spike quantities associating to lentiviral particles. In accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kemp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Meng et al., 2021</xref>), deletion of H<sup>69</sup>/V<sup>70</sup> increased spike abundance in pseudotyped particles.</p>
<p id="P9">We challenged these findings by analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

<title>Enhanced cell-cell fusion and reduced virus particle entry by B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 spike</title>
<p id="P10">We next analyzed fusogenicity of individual spike proteins in a cell-cell fusion assay based on co-cultures of CHO cells transiently expressing HIV-1 Tat and individual SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and ACE2/TMPRSS2-transfected, LTR-luciferase-expressing target TZM-bl cells. Compared to B.1 spike, no significant changes in membrane fusion activity were detected with any single mutation present in B.1.1.7 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, full B.1.1.7 spike was more prone to induce cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, entry of lentiviral pseudotypes mediated by the same set of spike proteins was quantified after transduction of Calu-3 cells using p24 capsid normalized inocula in a luciferase-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Whereas most individual mutations did not significantly alter the ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike to mediate entry into Calu-3 cells, T<sup>716</sup>I and the full B.1.1.7 spike mediated reduced entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Fig. S2A</xref>). The inferior ability of B.1.1.7 spike-containing lentiviral pseudotypes to transduce Calu-3 cells was corroborated in titration experiments on ACE2/TMPRSS2-positive A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and is potentially related to the lower levels of incorporated spike when compared to B.1 spike-pseudotyped particles.</p>
<p id="P11">We next investigated entry kinetics in Calu-3 and A549-ACE2 cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2. In single-cycle entry experiments, virus inocula were absorbed at 4°C for one hour, cells were washed to remove excessive virus particles, and the cells eventually incubated at 37°C to initiate synchronized entry. <italic>De novo</italic>-synthesized, cell-associated subgenomic transcripts served for detection of early signs of virus replication after entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and 4E</xref>). Reminiscent of our results obtained with the lentiviral pseudotypes, B.1.1.7 initiated slightly lower levels of virus replication in Calu-3, A549-ACE2 and A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells when compared to B.1 at the earliest time point at which subgenomic RNA production was detectable. ACE2 seems to be required for entry into A549, as levels of subgenomic viral RNA remained at background levels in parental A549. Entry of both viruses in Calu-3 cells depended on TMPRSS2 and furin and less on a cathepsin L-dependent pathway. In addition, clathrin inhibition resulted in decreased endocytic entry of B.1 and B.1.1.7 in Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2B</xref>), as was previously described for SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Inocula were back-titrated to ensure that equal amounts of virus were used for infection. In conclusion, B.1.1.7 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles and authentic B.1.1.7 are less efficient in entering susceptible target cells than their B.1 counterparts. This inefficiency may be related to the detected lower efficiency of spike processing.</p>

<title>B.1.1.7 fails to escape from neutralizing antibodies and may dampen induction of innate immunity</title>

Interestingly, binding of B.1.1.7 RBD, which differs from that of B.1 solely at one position (N<sup>501</sup>Y), to ACE2 in a surrogate neutralization test was slightly less sensitive to inhibition by antibodies from non-VOC convalescents and vaccinees when compared to antibodies raised following B.1.1.7 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that antibodies targeting other regions than the RBD may contribute to the neutralization of infection. However, B.1.351 RBD was clearly more resistant to ACE2 binding inhibition than the B.1 and B.1.1.7 RBDs. These results suggest a large absence of escape from humoral immunity by B.1.1.7, as opposed to B.1.351.</p>
<p id="P13">We next hypothesized that B.1.1.7 has evolved superior ability to prevent or evade cell-intrinsic immunity.

<title>B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 display a spike-dependent, ACE2-independent post-entry replication advantage in NCI-H1299 cells</title>
<p id="P15">We reasoned that common cell culture models used up to this point may have failed to reflect the predominant spread of B.1.1.7 observed in the human population. Upon further exploration of susceptible cell lines, we identified that the human bronchial cell line NCI-H1299 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Phelps et al., 1996</xref>) supports B.1.1.7 growth with up to 24-fold higher efficiency than B.1 growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) in multi-cycle growth kinetics. The smaller plaque size of B.1.1.7 virus originating from Vero E6 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, lower panel) was corroborated with NCI-H1299 cell-derived virus.</p>
<p id="P16">Interestingly, there was no advantage in entry of lentiviral particles based on the B.1.1.7 spike protein in NCI-H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Also, there was no advantage for authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. virus in entering NCI-H1299 cells in a synchronized entry assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that the more efficient replication of B.1.1.7 may not necessarily be determined by improved entry. Even more surprisingly, replication of B.1.1.7 in NCI-H1299 cells occurred in the absence of detectable ACE2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), and <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> mRNAs were only weakly expressed as compared to other SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). In order to exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection in NCI-H1299 cells was maintained by minute traces of ACE2 expressed below the detection limit of our system, we blocked ACE2 by antibodies. Individual incubation of Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells with three ACE2-neutralizing antibodies abolished and diminished SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A-B</xref>). In contrast, anti-ACE2 antibody treatment did not and only very modestly modulate the susceptibility of NCI-H1299 to B.1 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3C</xref>), reinforcing the notion that this cell line supports infection via a largely ACE2-independent mechanism.</p>
<p id="P17">To analyze the specificity of the observed phenotypic changes for the spike protein, we generated, by reverse genetics, a Wuhan-1 virus with a D<sup>614</sup>G mutation (representing a B.1 virus, rB.1), as well as a Wuhan-1 virus carrying the full spike protein of B.1.1.7 (rB.1/Spike B.1.1.7). Moreover, we engineered a virus consisting of the B.1.1.7 backbone but the Wuhan-1 D<sup>614</sup>G spike, representing a prototypic B.1 spike (rB.1.1.7/Spike B.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H-J</xref>). As expected, all recombinant viruses grew to similar titers in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). In Calu-3 cells, growth of rB.1.1.7/Spike B.1 was increased 9-fold over rB.1 at 72 hours post-infection, suggesting that the B.1.1.7 backbone may confer replication advantages that do not depend on the spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). In NCI-H1299 cells, the virus expressing the B.1.1.7 spike in the backbone of B.1 grew to considerably higher titers (up to 65-fold increased titer) than the reciprocal virus and the original rB.1 virus (up to 15-fold increased titer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref>). This suggests the replicative advantage of B.1.1.7 in NCI-H1299 cells, while probably exerted on entry, is mediated by the spike protein.</p>
<p id="P18">We next reasoned that NCI-H1299 cell-specific increased viral growth may be a property that is shared by the current, predominating VOC Delta. In Calu-3 cells and in hBAEC cultures, a B.1.617.2 isolate grew to similar and increased titers, respectively, compared to B.1 and B.1.1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6L</xref>). Remarkably, in multi-cycle infection experiments in NCI-H1299 cells, B.1.617.2 grew to 264 (min. 37 -max. 595)-fold higher titers than B.1 and 24 (min. 3 -max. 59)-fold higher titers than B.1.1.7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6M</xref>). Together, these data suggest that VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.671.2 may utilize partially common mechanisms of replication enhancement that are spike-dependent but do not improve entry efficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">To date, our understanding of molecular mechanisms that underlie the rapid spread and/or increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is still in its infancy. As SARS-CoV-2 productively infects epithelial cells (Hou et al., 2020), and B.1.1.7-infected patients shed 10-fold more viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jones et al., 2021</xref>), we hypothesized that B.1.1.7 has a replication advantage in human epithelial cell cultures. Although all immortalized, primary, and organoid cultures tested were highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we failed to detect a B.1.1.7-specific growth advantage with one notable exception. Our findings corroborate reports by others showing a similar growth rate of B.1.1.7 and B.1. viruses in common culture cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brown et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Touret et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ulrich et al., 2021</xref>). Despite monitoring infected cultures for up to ten days, we failed to observe temporally increased virus production in human organoid models as seen by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lamers et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, B.1.1.7 has been proposed to display a fitness advantage in experimentally infected ferrets, in hACE2-K18Tg-transgenic mice and hACE2-KI transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ulrich et al., 2021</xref>), but not in Syrian hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nuñez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ulrich et al., 2021</xref>). In line with these results, our data confirm the absence of significant growth differences between B.1.1.7 and B.1 variants in experimentally infected dwarf hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abdelnabi et al., 2021</xref>). However, a recent study did observe a transmission advantage of B.1.1.7 upon low dose infection of Syrian hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mok et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, in intranasally infected African green monkeys, B.1.1.7 infection generated higher levels of viral RNA in the respiratory tract than B.1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosenke et al., 2021</xref>). Together, the superiority of B.1.1.7 spread can be recapitulated in some animal models, but is not detectable in most cell culture systems.</p>
<p id="P20">B.1 SARS-CoV-2 productively infects susceptible cells via binding of the spike protein to ACE2 and TMPRSS2-mediated priming of spike (Hoffmann et al., Cell 2020). Compared to B.1 viruses, B.1.1.7 viruses and B.1.1.7 spike-decorated lentiviral particles were equally or even less efficient in entering ACE2-expressing cell lines. Intriguingly, B.1.1.7 spike appeared to be more fusogenic in cell-cell fusion assays, in accordance with published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Meng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rajah et al., 2021</xref>). Proteolytic processing and viral packaging of coronaviral spike can be rate-limiting during infectious virus production. Our findings of reduced proteolytic cleavage in spike plasmid-transfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are consistent with reduced furin-mediated processing of B.1.1.7 spike as shown by a biochemical peptide cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lubinski et al., 2021b</xref>), and challenge data reporting intact processing of cell-associated spike when expressed in spike plasmid-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Mlcochova et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, the latter study used plasmids expressing spikes lacking 19 C-terminal amino acids, an experimental modification that has been widely accepted for artificial enhancement of cell surface expression and lentiviral incorporation of spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), and that we refrained to adopt in order to maintain the expression context as physiological as possible. The observation of reduced processing translated into lower levels of lentivirus-associated spike, which may be the cause of the reduced infectivity of particles. Even though impaired maturation did not detectably alter virion-associated spike levels under our experimental conditions, we cannot exclude that it may still modulate the kinetics of virus particle secretion and/or the quality of secreted SARS-CoV-2 particles.</p>
<p id="P21">Whereas increased B.1.1.7 replication has been observed in patients, the initial phase of virus infection is difficult to capture in clinical observations due to late sampling, making cell culture studies potentially more insightful. On the contrary, cell cultures may fail to reflect differences in virus production in later stages of tissue infection due to the limiting effect of cytopathogenic effects i<italic>n vitro</italic>. Our observation of reduced growth of B.1.1.7 in cell culture does not necessarily contradict clinical observations. We observed a slower ramp-up of virus production, delayed onset of cytopathic effect, and slightly reduced levels of <italic>IFNL</italic> expression for B.1.1.7, which, overall, is consistent with a stealthy invasion of tissue with initially limited production of PAMPs and more efficient evasion of cell-intrinsic innate immunity, as suggested by others. The previously reported transcriptional changes affecting the N gene reading frame, leading to expression of ORF9b potentially acting as an antagonist of IFN induction, as well as the reported increase of production of the IFN signaling antagonist ORF6, may contribute to this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Parker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thorne et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, infected air-liquid interface cultures of alveolar type 2 cells produced more infectious B.1.1.7 virus when compared to B.1 only in a late phase of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lamers et al., 2021</xref>). Also, replication of B.1 and B.1.1.7 variants in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected African green monkeys differed only from day 5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rosenke et al., 2021</xref>). Together, this suggests a delayed but extended phase of infectious B.1.1.7 virion shedding, potentially resulting in a prolonged phase of heightened transmission probability, which is also supported by preliminary viral load studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kissler et al., 2021a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">While cell-intrinsic immunity may be involved, its onset and extent is still dependent on fundamental factors such as receptor usage and cell entry, often reflected by changes in the spike protein. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract are low and common cell culture models may not fully recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> properties of primary target tissues of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hikmet et al., 2020</xref>). Our exploration of other cell cultures may thus have uncovered a cell line that has remained understudied with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infection phenotypes. While caveats and limitations of neoplastic cell lines apply, NCI-H1299 cells yielded higher levels of replication and infectious virus production not only for B.1.1.7, but also for B.1.617.2. This cell line of epithelial morphology is devoid of detectable ACE2 protein and remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection even in the presence of ACE2-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the existence of an alternative, but not variant-specific mode of entry. This finding is reminiscent of a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Puray-Chavez et al., 2021</xref>) that identified SARS-CoV-2 infection of the H522 lung cell line in an ACE2-independent fashion (in this study the alternative way of infection could only be utilized by viruses carrying an E<sup>484</sup>D substitution within the spike protein RBD).</p>
<p id="P23">Surprisingly, while experiments with reciprocal chimeras established that the B.1.1.7 spread advantage in NCI-H1299 cells is mediated to a large extent by its spike, the entry process <italic>per se</italic> was similarly or even less efficient for B.1.1.7 than for B.1. Notably, a virus consisting of the B.1.1.7 backbone with B.1 spike displayed a slightly better replication efficiency than the original B.1 virus in type-I IFN-competent Calu-3 cells, confirming that other genetic determinants of B.1.1.7 beyond spike contribute to enhanced replication. These findings suggest a post-entry, yet largely spike-dependent replication advantage of B.1.1.7 that manifests itself in NCI-H1299 cells. Remarkably, we conducted preliminary studies of replication for B.1.617.2 and found a highly similar phenotype, i.e., a similar level of replication in common ACE2-positive cell lines but a specific increase of replication in NCI-H1299 cells that does not seem to be determined by improved entry. In addition, B.1.617.2 displayed a spreading advantage in human BAECs that manifested itself not before four days post-infection. The extent of growth advantage for B.1.617.2 in NCI-H1299 cells was higher than for B.1.1.7, which would be expected given the observed differences in epidemic growth rates for these VOCs. More work will be necessary to understand the nature of the alternative entry mechanism, the identity of the entry-independent and variant-specific difference in replication as a function of spike, as well as the possibility that two VOCs may have undergone convergent evolution towards utilization of this same unknown mechanism. Also, whether the ACE2-independent entry is linked to the replication advantage, e.g. by potentially more efficient virion release due to ACE2 scarcity or absence, remains unclear at this time. Mere absence of ACE2 expression is not sufficient for B.1.1.7-specific growth advantage as illustrated by the refractoriness of ACE2-negative A549 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies are required for the identification of a hypothetical alternative receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and for the elucidation of the specific cellular environment of NCI-H1299 cells that confers a replication advantage to B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2.</p>

To confirm that the virus is detectable over five passages, concentration of viral RNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (E gene assay) from each passage. To determine the variant frequency in each passage, RNA samples were sequenced using next generation sequencing techniques (Illumina technology). For virus sequence analysis, the raw sequences were trimmed, matched and presorted for SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence reads. The processed sequence reads were mapped to the BetaCoV/Munich/ChVir984/2020 genome (here referred to as SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV strain) in Geneious (version 9.1.8). The two virus variants in each sample were distinguished from each other by their lineage-specific mutations.

Briefly, sera of infected and vaccinated patients were diluted 1:10 with sample dilution buffer, mixed 1:1 with B.1-HRP-RBD, B.1.1.7-HRP-RBD, and B.1.351-HRP-RBD (provided by Medac, Wedel, Germany) solution and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Afterwards, the mixture was added to the hACE2-coated plate and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. After washing, 3’3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine solution was added, and the plate was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. Stop solution was then added and the optical density at 450 nm was measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO plate reader. For calculation of the relative inhibition of ACE2/RBD binding, the following formula was applied: Inhibition score (%) = (1 − OD value sample/OD value negative control) × 100%. Values below zero were set to zero.</p>

<title>Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p id="P55">If not stated otherwise, bars and symbols show the arithmetic mean of the indicated amount of independent replicates. Error bars indicate S.D. from at least three or S.E.M. from the indicated amount of individual experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (V 8.3.0 or 9.1.2) using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests or for comparing neutralizing activities the Friedman test and Dunn’s multiple comparison unless indicated differently. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered significant (*), &lt;0.01 (**), &lt;0.001 (***), &lt;0.0001 (****); n.s. = not significant (≥0.05).</p>
