<p id="P2">Current COVID-19 vaccines need to take at least one month to complete inoculation and then become effective. Around 51% global population are still not fully vaccinated. Instantaneous protection is an unmet need among those who are not fully vaccinated. In addition, breakthrough infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 are widely reported. All these highlight the unmet needing for short-term instantaneous prophylaxis (STIP) in the communities where SARS-CoV-2 is circulating. Previously, we reported nanobodies isolated from an alpaca immunized with the spike protein, exhibiting ultrahigh potency against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Herein, we found that Nb22, among our previously reported nanobodies, exhibited ultrapotent neutralization against Delta variant with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.41 ng/ml (5.13 pM). Furthermore, the crystal structural analysis revealed that the binding of Nb22 to WH01 and Delta RBDs both effectively blocked the binding of RBD to hACE2. Additionally, intranasal Nb22 exhibited protection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Of note, intranasal Nb22 also demonstrated high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in STIP for seven days administered by single dose and exhibited long-lasting retention in the respiratory system for at least one month administered by four doses, providing a means of instantaneous short-term prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, ultrahigh potency, long-lasting retention in the respiratory system as well as stability at room-temperature make the intranasal or inhaled Nb22 to be a potential therapeutic or STIP agent against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">SARS-CoV-2 has given rise to the COVID-19 pandemic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, resulting in massive disruption of social and economic activities. Global vaccination has provided protection against the catastrophic outcome of the pandemic. However, a number of individuals are either not fully vaccinated or cannot mount adequate responses to the vaccine. Additionally, current COVID-19 vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full effectiveness and the immunity wanes within a matter of months, which increases the risk of infection and demands the use of agents for providing instantaneous protection at vulnerable times. Several antibodies were approved for emergency use within 7 days of high-risk exposure in the Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against SARS-CoV-2 infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> However, there is no licensed agent in preventing infection before exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., as pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP). A few PrEP studies in animal model demonstrated that antibodies exhibited accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 when administered 1-3 days prior to infection<sup>2,4-6</sup>. The efficacy was not fully explored when antibodies were administered more than three days prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no effective intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in advance of one week or longer. Therefore, there is a research gap on short-term instantaneous prophylaxis (STIP) that prevention can take effective immediately following antibody infusion and last for one week or longer. As such, STIP is an unmet need for the prevention against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P5">The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in December 2020 and has become predominant in many countries, characterized by the spike protein mutations T19R, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N and a double deletion at 157158 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. It has been designated as a Variant of Concern (VOC) and is believed to be 60% more transmissible than Alpha variant <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> Delta variant poses a challenge to the available COVID-19 vaccines, such as the protective effectiveness of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines against Delta variant was reduced to 60% and 88%, respectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. More recently, a newly emerged variant, Omicron, has spread rapidly in parts of the world and drawn attention for its potential impact on the global public health; however, in most of the world including China, Delta variant remains the dominant virus and the focus of the containment efforts. Recent research indicated that the Delta variant partially but significantly resisted neutralization by mAbs including Bamlanivimab, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> While B1-182.1 and A23-58.1, recently isolated from convalescent donors, exhibited ultrapotent neutralization against Delta variant with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.0 and 1.6 ng/ml, respectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">To date, a growing number of nanobodies, single-domain fragments of camelid heavy-chain antibodies or VHH, were reported for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, nanobodies with potent neutralization against Delta variant were rarely reported <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. As SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through and replicates in respiratory tract and lungs, and does not transverse in blood<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, we believe that, nanobodies’s exceptional resistance to extreme pH and high temperature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, makes them ideal candidates to be administered via intranasal or oral rout, directly to the site of viral infection. Previously, we identified three ultrapotent nanobodies against the initial strain of SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-01 (WH01); accordingly, one of the intranasally delivered nanobody was shown to protect hACE2 mice infected by WH01 strain<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, we compared the neutralizing potency of the aforementioned nanobodies against various circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Nb22-Fc was identified to exhibit increased neutralization potency against Delta variant compared to WH01 strain, to which the antibody was originally raised. The binding characterization and crystal structural analysis were conducted to further elucidate the potential mechanism. Furthermore, therapeutic studies demonstrate that intranasal Nb22 exhibited complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in hACE2 mice. Additionally, we comprehensively evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of Nb22 when intranasally administered at 1, 3, 5, 7 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, single dose of intranasal Nb22 still exhibited protective against hACE2 mice even when administered 7 days prior to infection of Delta variant. Moreover, four doses of intranasal Nb22 could maintain long-lasting retention in respiratory system for more than one month. All these indicate that intranasal Nb22 could be applied not only in the PrEP and PEP but also in the STIP, filling the gap between the long-term lagging prevention and PreP.</p>

<title>Potent neutralization of Delta variant by nanobodies</title>
<p id="P8">We previously reported the discovery and characterization of three potent neutralizing nanobodies against WH01 strain and its variants with IC<sub>50</sub> values of ~1 ng/ml. These three nanobodies (Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc) were identified to bind to RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Neutralization experiments were further conducted to measure their activity against the circulating variants including variants of concern (VOC) comprising Alpha (B.1.1.7 with N501Y), Beta (B.1.351 with E484K and N501Y), Delta (B.1.617.2 with L452R and T478K) and Gamma (P.1 with K417T, E484K and N501Y), as well as variants of interest (VOI) comprising Eta (B.1.525 with E484K), Iota (B.1.526 with E484K), Epsilon (B.1.429 with L452R), and Kappa (B.1.617.1 with L452R and E484Q) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Nb15-Fc exhibited increased potency against Alpha variant, but decreased potency against Delta variant or Epsilon as compared with WH01, the RBD used to select the nanobodies. Nb31-Fc exhibited reduced potency against Alpha, Delta and Epsilon variants relative to WH01 or D614G variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-G</xref>). Interestingly, Nb22-Fc exhibited about 2.5-fold increased neutralizing potency against Delta variant with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.41 ng/ml (5.13 pM) compared to WH01 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.01 ng/ml (12.63 pM). Notably, Nb22-Fc also exhibited around 8.4-fold increased neutralization potency against Delta variant relative to variant Alpha with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.45 ng/ml (43.13 pM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-G</xref>). Impressively, Nb22-Fc also exhibited outstanding neutralizing curve against authentic Delta variant compared to Nb15-Fc and Nb31-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-G</xref>). All three nanobodies failed to neutralize variants containing E484K/Q mutation, suggesting that E484K/Q mutation in RBD could lead to the resistance to all three nanobodies. Altogether, Nb15-Fc presented the most potent neutralization against variant Alpha with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.18 ng/ml, and Nb15-Fc and Nb31-Fc still retained potent neutralization of variants containing L452R and T478K mutations in RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-F</xref>), though with reduced potency like most other anti-RBD antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> Of note, Nb22-Fc exhibited the most potent neutralization against pseudotyped or authentic Delta variant virus among three nanobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-G</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Characterization of Nb22-Fc binding to RBD</title>
<p id="P9">To explore antibody binding characteristics to the RBD with respect to their neutralization of Delta variant, the interactions of three nanobodies with variant RBDs were analyzed using biolayer interferometry (BLI). Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc showed high affinity interactions with RBD of Delta variant at 1.86 nM, 0.31 nM and 0.31 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). However, the ultrahigh affinity of Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc to the RBD of Delta variant did not fully reflect the neutralization potency as Nb22-Fc neutralized Delta variant with markedly more potency than that of Nb31-Fc, suggesting that affinity is not the only factor dictating the neutralization activity. Furthermore, Nb22-Fc exhibited increased affinity with Delta variant RBD relative to other variant RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>), which is in line with the increased potency conferred by Nb22-Fc against Delta variant as compared with other variants.</p>
<p id="P10">Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Nb22-Fc specifically interacted with spike protein from WH01, D614G, Alpha, Epsilon and Delta variants on the surface of transfected 293T cells, whereas no binding with the spike protein from other variants containing E484K/Q mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These results were substantiated by flow cytometric results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Overall, these specific binding characteristics are consistent with its specific neutralization properties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Structural analysis of RBD-Nb22 complex</title>
<p id="P11">Structural analysis of Nb22 interaction with RBD was performed to address the ultrahigh potency of Nb22 against WH01 strain and Delta variant. Initially, we determined the crystal structure of WH01 RBD-Nb22 complex at a resolution of 2.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Nb22 adopts a typical β-barreled structure, and contains three variable complementarity-determining regions (CDR) binding to RBD. The buried surface area (BSA) was 800 Å<sup>2</sup>, mainly constituting of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. 14 residues constituting epitope of three CDRs were identified using a distance of &lt;4 Å as the cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). For CDR1, T30 and S33 formed two hydrogen bonds with S494 of RBD, while the hydrophobic interactions included A32 and F34 of Nb22 and Y449, L452, F490 and Q493 of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). N57 of CDR2 interacted with G485 by hydrogen bond, and the hydrophobic interactions were mediated by I56 and Y489 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). CDR3 is a relatively longer region with only one hydrogen bond (Y119 and G446). The side chain of P104 inserted into the hydrophobic cavity formed by F101, R107, Y453, F456 and Y495 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Apart from the five hydrogen bonds in CDR regions, the interface of Nb22 and RBD was stabilized by two additional hydrogen bonds consisting of G1, S75, N450 and E484 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Interactions were also facilitated by the hydrophobic network constituted by P2, Q3, V4, G28, G29, R73 and D74 of Nb22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Superimposition of the structure of WH01 RBD-Nb22 complex and RBD-hACE2 (PDB code: 6MOJ) immediately elucidates the structural basis of neutralization, in which the binding of Nb22 to RBD effectively blocks the binding of RBD to hACE2 during virus infection. Firstly, the binding site of Nb22 on RBD partially overlaps with that of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Secondly, the loop (V102-Y117) of Nb22 clashes with two α-helices of the N-terminus of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To elucidate the increased potency of Nb22 in neutralizing Delta variant, we determined the Delta RBD-Nb22 complex structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å, which revealed that two distinct mutations, T478K and L452R, had differing impact on the binding K478 locates outside the CDR binding regions, and does not disturb the interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, T478K mutation does not affect Nb22 neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, the mutation of hydrophilic leucine to positively charged arginine (R) at position 452 significantly enhances the interactions of RBD with the CDR3 region of Nb22. Two additionally formed hydrogen bonds, T30-R452 and S33-Q493, pull the CDR3 loop of Nb22 closer to R452 region of RBD, as revealed by the superimposition of the structures of WH01 and Delta RBD-Nb22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), explaining enhanced neutralization activity of Nb22 against the Delta variant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Nb22 exhibits room-temperature stability in vitro and long-lasting retention in vivo</title>
<p id="P14">Nanobodies exhibit various advantages including thermostability. We reported that nanobodies could retain 100% activity even after being incubated at 70 °C for one hour and retain 83% activity after 80 °C treatment for one hour<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Further evaluation showed that Nb22 could maintain full activity for at least two months at room temperature and did not lose any activity even undergoing five rounds of freeze-thawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>), indicating that Nb22-Fc is highly stable and idea for non-cold chain storage and use at room-temperature.</p>
<p id="P15">To determine Nb22-Fc distribution in vivo, YF®750 SE-labeled Nb22 (Nb22-YF750) was administered via intranasal (i.n.) in a mouse model. The fluorescence could be readily detected in respiratory system including nasopharynx, trachea and lung 2h post infusion. The fluorescence was detectable for more than seven days after a single dose of 200 ug (average of 10 mg/kg) Nb22-YF750 administration, which is in agreement with our previous reports. As expected, the fluorescence could be detected for more than one month when four doses of 200 μg (average of 10 mg/kg) Nb22-YF750 were administered every week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Nb22-Fc could also be detected in the blood, indicating that Nb22-Fc could also exert its activity in the blood after bypassing the respiratory system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). All these observations of prolonged retention of Nb22-Fc in the respiratory system suggest the potential application of the antibody for STIP against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, intranasal Nb22-Fc could be developed as an STIP reagent for its long-lasting retention in the respiratory system and a portable therapeutics thanks to its room-temperature stability.</p>

<title>Intranasal Nb22 is highly efficacious in the STIP, PreP and PeP in hACE2 transgenic mice challenged by Delta variant</title>
<p id="P16">To evaluate the efficacy of Nb22-Fc in vivo, hACE2 transgenic mice were challenged with 1x10<sup>5</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (CRST: 1633.06.IVCAS 6.7593) and conducted as we previously reported<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. hACE2 mice were divided into nine groups (n=3-6) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> and 200 μg (average of 10 mg/kg) Nb22-Fc was administered via i.n. before or after Delta variant challenge to evaluate the antibody’s prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy against Delta variant infection. Viral RNA in the lungs was detected in virus control group named as SARS-CoV-2 group (Group 2). Animals in Control Nb group Group 3 were challenged with Delta variant and received control nanobody treatment one hour post infection. As expected, high copy numbers of viral RNA were also detected in control Nb mice without significant difference compared to SARS-CoV-2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">In order to evaluate the prophylactic duration conferred by Nb22, a single dose of Nb22 was administered via i.n. at days 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively, prior to Delta variant challenge. Viral RNA copies increased over the course of Nb22-Fc administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). As expected, viral RNA copies in the aforementioned prophylactic groups were all significantly lower than that in the control Nb group, indicating that even a single dose of Nb22-Fc could provide protection against Delta variant infection in hACE2 transgenic mice for 7 days. Nb22 administered in -7d and -5d before challenge significantly reduced viral load though failed to provide complete protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Notably, Nb22 exhibited significant prevention against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the - 3d Nb22 (Group 6) and -1d Nb22 group (Group 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). All these indicate that Nb22-Fc provides better protection at the earlier time points upon infection.</p>
<p id="P18">In the therapeutic group, viral RNA copies in the animals treated with Nb22 at 1 hour or 1 day postinfection were undetectable in 5/5 mice in the groups 8 and 9, suggesting that Nb22 had complete protection of hACE2 mice against Delta variant infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The viral RNA results were also validated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining and HE staining in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). We noted that mice challenged by Delta variant did not show obvious weight loss even in 4 days post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In summary, Nb22 exhibited high efficacy in both the prevention and therapy of hACE2 transgenic mice challenged with Delta variant. Nb22 provided complete protection in PEP (in 1h Nb22 group and 1d Nb22 group) and exhibited high efficacy in PrEP (in - 1d Nb22 and -3d Nb22 group). Impressively, a single dose of Nb22 could maintain effectiveness in the prevention against Delta variant infection for at least seven days (in -7d Nb22 group), indicating the potential application for STIP against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">To date, a small number of nanobodies with ultrahigh potency against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have been reported <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, whereas nanobodies with potent neutralization against the currently dominant Delta variant were rarely reported. Our results revealed that three previously reported nanobodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, retained ultrahigh potency in neutralization against the Delta variant. Among them, Nb22-Fc with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.41ng/ml (5.13 pM) is outstanding with increased neutralization of Delta variant relative to Alpha variant. The Nb22 binding to RBD provides mechanistic insight into the enhanced neutralization against Delta variant, suggesting that the increased binding affinity enhanced the neutralizing potency against Delta variant relative to Alpha variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Given that most anti-RBD, anti-NTD antibodies or convalescent sera or vaccine-elicited antibodies showed reduced neutralization of Delta variant relative to that of Alpha variant <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, the increased neutralization activity of Nb22-Fc against Delta variant is particularly striking and the structural basis of the phenomenon is of interest for understanding the neutralization mechanisms.</p>
<p id="P20">The structural analysis further illustrated the characteristics of Nb22 binding to WH01 and Delta RBD and the mechanisms of viral inhibition. Nb22 binding to RBD effectively blocks the binding of RBD to hACE2 during virus infection. The binding site of Nb22 on RBD overlaps with that of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), and the loop (V102-Y117) of Nb22 clashes with two α-helixes of the N-terminus of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). In addition, crystal structural analysis showed that T478K mutation of Delta variant are located outside 800 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA of Nb22 interacting with RBD and do not perturb the interaction between Nb22 and the RBD of Delta variant. Of note, the guanidine moiety in the L452R mutation forms an additional hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of T30 of Nb22, pulling the CDR3 loop of Nb22 closer, and leading to an extra hydrogen bond between S33 of Nb22 and Q493 of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Consequently, the BSA extends from 800 Å<sup>2</sup> to 835 Å<sup>2</sup>, in comparison with that of Nb22-WH01 RBD. All these contribute to the enhanced binding and neutralizing potency of Nb22 against Delta variant.</p>
<p id="P21">Compared to conventional antibodies for passive immunization, nanobodies are efficiently produced in prokaryotic expression systems at low cost and possess favorable biophysical properties including high thermostability<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. We reported that nanobodies could remain 100% activity even incubated at 70 °C for one hour and are amenable to engineering of multimeric nanobody constructs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Such nanobodies exhibit high effectiveness against virus infection via intranasal administration<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. The results reveal that Nb22 could maintain full activity for more than two months at room temperature and does not lose any activity even after undergoing five rounds of freeze-thawing.</p>
<p id="P22">Our results demonstrate that a single dose of intranasal Nb22 could exhibit efficacy in the STIP, PrEP and PEP against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice. Of note, a single dose of intranasal Nb22 could maintain efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least one week in hACE2 mice, which would readily serve as STIP. Our antibody distribution results also revealed that Nb22 could retain in respiratory tracts for at least one month when weekly administered via i.n.. As such, we anticipate that Nb22 could provide one month prevention against SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered intranasally every week.</p>
<p id="P23">VLong-term lagging prevention against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by approved vaccine usually takes more than one month to be effective and then lasts for months or years<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Vaccine efficacy has been shown to wan within months after vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Instantaneous prevention of SARS-CoV-2 is also needed for individuals who do not take vaccines when SARS-CoV-2 is circulating. A few studies in animal model just demonstrated that antibodies exhibited accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in PrEP when administered 1-3 days prior to infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Whereas, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have fully investigated the STIP that prevention could be readily effective immediately following inoculation and last for more than one week to one month for people at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can also serve to reduce transmission during the asymptomatic stage of the infection As such, our results demonstrate that intranasal Nb22 with ultrahigh potency and long-lasting retention in the lung could satisfy the need of STIP against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P24">In summary, structural analysis provides a mechanistic explanation to the enhanced sensitivity of Delta variant and the increased neutralization potency of this antibody. The structural analysis may further guide the rational design of pan-coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Nb22 exhibited one of the ultrahigh neutralization potencies among the reported antibodies or nanobodies against Delta variant infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. We presented proof of concept of STIP against SARS-CoV-2 using our Nb22 and suggest STIP as a new prophylactic strategy for long-lasting antibodies to prevent virus infection. Although the newly emerged Omicron variant is spreading globally, the Delta variant remains the dominant variant and likely the deadliest in most of the world; therefore, the ultrahigh potent, and thermal stable Nb22 is an excellent candidate for intranasal or inhalable anti-SARS-Cov-2 agent for both therapy or prophylaxis, especially including STIP.</p>
