To identify and characterize virus-virus interactions at the cellular level, we coinfected human lung cells with influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography revealed extracellular and membrane-associated filamentous structures consistent with hybrid viral particles (HVPs). We show that HVPs harbor surface glycoproteins and ribonucleoproteins of IAV and RSV, and use the RSV fusion glycoprotein to evade anti-IAV neutralising antibodies and to infect and spread among cells lacking IAV receptors. Finally, we show evidence of IAV and RSV coinfection within cells of the bronchial epithelium, with viral proteins from both viruses co-localising at the apical surface. Our observations have profound implications for infection biology as they define a previously unknown interaction between respiratory viruses that might affect virus pathogenesis by expanding virus tropism and facilitating immune evasion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Viruses are intracellular pathogens whose replication relies on the infection of a restricted subset of cell types, a property known as tropism. As multiple viruses exhibit the same tropism, cells and tissues are susceptible to infection by a community of taxonomically diverse viruses. From this perspective, a tissue or body compartment constitutes an ecological niche in which members of a virus community co-exist. Coinfections by more than one virus represent between ~10-30% of all respiratory viral infections and are common among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The clinical impact of viral coinfections is unclear: while some studies indicate that coinfections do not alter the outcome of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), others report increased incidence of viral pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). At the cellular level, the underlying interactions that determine the outcome of coinfections are unclear. Direct interactions between viruses within coinfected cells can result in changes to viral progenies, including -but not limited to- pseudotyping (incorporation of surface proteins from a different virus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) or genomic rearrangements, which may generate novel strains with pandemic potential such as SARS-CoV-2 and pandemic influenza A viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, we examined interactions between two commonly co-circulating viruses of clinical importance: influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). IAV causes over five million hospitalizations each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and RSV is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children under five years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To study virus-virus interactions during confection, we infected a cell line derived from human lung (A549) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), with a mixed inoculum of IAV and RSV, or individual viruses as controls. Infections were performed at high multiplicity of infection (MOI) to facilitate coinfection and recapitulate high MOIs produced in advanced stages of infection (when IAV and RSV foci may come into contact). We compared viral replication in single infections and coinfections. Single IAV infections resulted in robust replication, peaking between 24-48 hours post-infection (hpi). In coinfections, IAV replication was similar to that observed in coinfection or at some timepoints marginally increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, top left). As RSV titres peaked in single infections at a later timepoint than IAV (72 hpi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, top right), further infections were performed to determine optimal conditions for coinfections by using a reduced IAV MOI (ten-fold reduction relative to RSV). The reduced IAV input did not affect IAV replication, which still replicated to higher titres in coinfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom left). In contrast, RSV titres were significantly reduced, by over 400-fold at 72 hpi, in the presence of IAV both at equivalent MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, top right) and when IAV MOI was reduced relative to RSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom right). These results are consistent with published studies that show that RSV is adversely impacted by coinfection, while IAV replication is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To assess if coinfection affected localization of key viral proteins or the proportion of infected cells, single and coinfections were performed as described above and cells were fixed at 24 hpi. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells infected with either RSV or IAV displayed features typical of the replicative cycle of each virus, such as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing RSV nucleoprotein (N), or diffuse IAV nucleoprotein (NP) staining within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, left column). Similar features were observed in coinfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, boxed area) suggesting that coinfection did not affect the intracellular localization of viral proteins. We counted the number of infected cells in single infections alongside the number of single infected and coinfected cells in the coinfection condition. We observed a high proportion of coinfected cells at 24 hpi when cells were infected with equivalent amounts of virus as well as when IAV input MOI was reduced 10-fold relative to RSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that superinfection exclusion does not prevent coinfection. Paradoxically, a higher number of RSV-positive cells were detected in coinfections than in RSV single-infected samples, contrasting with the observed reduction in RSV titre in coinfections.</p><p id="P5">IAV and RSV are enveloped viruses that target lipid rafts for assembly and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We therefore stained cells for the major glycoproteins of IAV and RSV: hemagglutinin (HA) and RSV fusion (F), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right column) and examined their localisation at plasma membranes. IAV HA diffusely coated the plasma membrane of infected cells in both single virus infections and coinfections, while RSV F was localized to regions containing filamentous structures extending from the cell surface, corresponding to budding RSV virions. In coinfected cells, HA was not excluded from RSV budding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right column, boxed area). We thus hypothesized that mixing of glycoproteins within these regions may result in incorporation of both IAV and RSV components to budding viral particles. To test this, we applied super-resolution confocal microscopy to image virions immunolabelled for HA and F at high resolution. We observed dual-positive fluorescence suggesting the presence of budding viral filaments possessing both IAV and RSV glycoproteins during coinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Strikingly, minimal colocalization between the two glycoproteins was observed. Instead, glycoproteins were incorporated in distinct regions along the filament, with most dual-positive filaments positive for IAV HA at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). 56±9.1% (mean ± SD) of coinfected cells displayed cell-associated dual-positive filaments. Many of these cells showed extensive production of dual-positive filaments, with no obvious indication of cell damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). We also observed dual-positive filaments distant from coinfected cells, suggesting they remained intact upon budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Nested among dual-positive filaments (both cell-associated and released), we identified filaments corresponding to IAV and RSV virions (identified by HA or F only staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). This indicates that regions in which dual-positive filaments form may contain both IAV and RSV budding sites.</p><p id="P6">We performed microscopy on live cells to visualize the native organization of the filaments budding from coinfected cells. Consistent with our previous observations, we detected bundles of filaments protruding from the cell surface that incorporated F along the length of the filament with HA localized at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To obtain better resolution of these budding viruses, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM). IAV single infection revealed a pleomorphic population of membrane-associated structures consistent with spherical, bacilliform and filamentous particles, whereas RSV single infection resulted in dense clusters of budding RSV filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). In coinfected cells we identified RSV−like filaments with structures branching from the distal ends resembling smaller bacilliform IAV-like virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To determine the structural details of IAV/RSV filamentous structures budding from coinfected cells, we performed cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and observed structures consistent with hybrid viral particles containing elements of both IAV and RSV. We repeatedly observed two classes of hybrid particles with some virions exhibiting features of both classes: in 11 cryotomograms we observed true hybrid virus particles (HVPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and in 16 cryo-tomograms we observed pseudotyped viruses (PVs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig. 3</xref>). Pleomorphic IAV particles and RSV filaments were also identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Extended data file 1, Extended Data Movies 1-2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">HVPs exhibited distinct IAV-like and RSV-like structural regions: the wider part of the filament resembled RSV and extended continuously towards the distal end to one or more narrow, IAV-like regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movies 1 and 2</xref>). Density consistent with both IAV and RSV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) could be visualized and seemed confined within their respective structural regions of the filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b and d</xref>). Glycoproteins consistent in size, shape and density with IAV or RSV glycoproteins decorated the respective IAV or RSV-like regions of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and e</xref>). In some virions, the junction between IAV and RSV regions had a clear lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 2</xref>), whilst other particles exhibited a much narrower join, with pinching off membranes between IAV and RSV areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Matrix layers were observed in IAV and RSV regions but were absent from the membrane bridging the two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We also identified virions consistent with RSV filaments containing (containing RSV RNPs) that had a different glycoprotein ordering than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig. 3</xref>). The glycoproteins differed in shape when compared to those present on RSV virions and had a triangular arrangement which resembled IAV glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data fig. 3c</xref>), rather than ring shaped density more consistent with RSV glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data fig. 3e</xref>). They also lacked the long-range helical ordering typical of RSV glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data fig.3c and e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We designated these structures <italic>pseudotyped viruses</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3a, c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 3</xref>). Some HVPs with distinct IAV- and RSV-like structural regions also exhibited pseudotyping within the RSV region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Notably, we did not observe IAV virions or IAV-like regions in hybrid particles that were pseudotyped with RSV glycoproteins. To quantify differences in glycoprotein arrangement, we determined the inter-spike distance on IAV, RSV and PVs. RSV exhibited a mean (+/- SD) inter-spike spacing of 12.9 (+/-2.32) nm, while IAV had a spacing of 8.71 (+/-1.18) nm. PVs had an average spike distance ranging from 8.31-9.56 nm, similar to IAV but significantly different to RSV (p&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). These results confirm that coinfections can result in the formation of two classes of hybrid viral particles structurally distinct from either parental virus.</p><p id="P10">As surface glycoproteins determine antigenicity and tropism, and HVPs incorporate glycoproteins of both IAV and RSV, we hypothesized that HVPs would display altered antigenicity. To test this, we first compared the neutralization efficiency of anti-IAV hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies against viruses collected from cells infected with IAV alone, or coinfected with IAV and RSV. As RSV is predominantly cell-associated, we performed neutralization assays using supernatant and cell-associated fractions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>). Viruses were also back-titrated to determine infectious titre of the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data Fig. 6</xref>) Viruses collected from coinfected cells displayed reduced IAV neutralization compared to those collected from single IAV infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). While the observed differences were not statistically significant, the decrease in neutralization efficiency was more marked in the cell-associated fraction of the coinfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) where only 33% (+/- 27%) (mean [+/- SD]) of IAV was neutralized, suggesting that two-thirds of IAV within this fraction was able to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In an analogous experiment, we compared the neutralization efficiency of anti-RSV F antibodies (Palivizumab) against viruses collected from cells infected with RSV alone or coinfected. RSV harvested from both single and mixed infections was efficiently neutralized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This suggests that, in contrast to IAV, RSV cannot utilise IAV glycoproteins to facilitate viral entry. Further, in the context of PVs, RSV infectivity may be determined by the ratio of incorporated IAV and RSV glycoproteins, where fully pseudotyped RSV filaments may be non-infectious, as they are unable to utilise IAV HA.</p><p id="P11">To determine if the incorporation of RSV glycoproteins could result in an expansion of IAV receptor tropism, we treated cells with neuraminidase (NA) to remove sialic acids (the cellular receptor for IAV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Sialic acid removal was confirmed by lectin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Virus was harvested from IAV or RSV single infections or coinfections as described for neutralisation assays and subsequently used to inoculate IAV-receptor-deficient (NA-treated) or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), as well as being back-titrated to determine the IAV titre in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended data Fig. 7c</xref>). Cells were fixed at 12 hpi, immunostained for IAV NP or RSV N and infected cells quantified. IAV entry was blocked in NA-treated cells when inoculated with the released virus of single IAV-infected cells, whereas entry of cell-associated IAV collected from single IAV infections was reduced by 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). When NA-treated cells were inoculated with released or cell-associated virus harvested from mixed infections, IAV entry was significantly increased compared to IAV-only infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The increase in IAV entry was higher in the cell-associated fraction, and IAV entry in receptor-deficient cells was restored to 63% (+/- 10%) (mean [+/- SD]) of the level of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As RSV does not use sialic acids as receptors, no differences in RSV entry between NA-treated or control cells were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). To determine if extracellular association between free IAV and RSV virions was contributing to IAV entry in NA-treated cells, IAV and RSV were mixed and incubated prior to infecting NA-treated or control cells. No significant differences were observed in IAV or RSV entry into receptor-deficient cells compared to control cells when the viruses had been pre-mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended data Fig. 7e</xref>), compared to each virus alone, suggesting that IAV and RSV do not associate upon extracellular mixing or that association does not impact viral entry. Overall, our findings suggest that the increase in IAV entry to sialic acid-deficient cells was a result of hybrid particle formation and indicate that HVPs represent a subpopulation of infectious virus particles with expanded receptor tropism. To determine whether the expansion of IAV tropism was mediated by the RSV F glycoprotein, virus harvested from mixed infections was incubated with Palivizumab. We observed a significant reduction in entry of both released and cell-associated IAV into NA-treated cells in the presence of Palivizumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>), suggesting that RSV F facilitates IAV infection via hybrid particles that enable IAV to enter cells that would otherwise be refractory to infection. We measured IAV entry into untreated control cells (i.e. cells with normal expression of sialic acids) in the presence or absence of Palivizumab. We observed that in the presence of Palivizumab, entry of IAV harvested from the cell associated fraction of coinfections was reduced by approximately half, compared to the Palivizumab-free control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This suggests that there is a population of IAV that is dependent on RSV F to gain entry to cells, which in turn suggests that RSV F is the functional glycoprotein of IAV/RSV HVPs.</p><p id="P12">Our cryo-ET data showed that HVPs contain IAV and RSV genomes. To determine if they possess infectivity for both viruses, we infected NA-treated cells with virus harvested from single or mixed infections. At 12 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for IAV HA and RSV F and imaged by confocal microscopy. The presence of coinfected cells suggested that both genomes were delivered into the cells simultaneously, likely by HVPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). This conclusion is based on the facts that 12 hours is not a sufficiently long time to allow extensive cell-to-cell spread by IAV and RSV which may result in coinfection; and because the probability of coinfection by chance was low as the MOI for each virus was approximately 0.01 (based on back-titrations of harvested virus). Examination of coinfected cells using super-resolution microscopy revealed viral IAV HA and RSV F double-positive filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), suggesting that the HVPs can be maintained over virus passage. To establish if HVPs could spread IAV from cell to cell within a population of cells refractory to IAV infection, we infected NA-treated or control cells with virus harvested from IAV single infections or from the cell-associated fraction of mixed infections (the fraction with enriched HVPs). We then applied an overlay to prevent virion diffusion and incubated the cells for 48 hours. As expected, in single IAV infections, abundant IAV-positive cells were observed in non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, top row). In the NA-treated cells, no infection by IAV from single infections was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, middle row), whereas IAV foci consisting of multiple distinct infected cells were observed in NA-treated cells infected with virus from mixed infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, bottom row). Notably, IAV-positive foci colocalised with RSV-positive foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, bottom row). These results suggests that HVPs can mediate the spread of IAV within a refractory cell population.</p><p id="P13">To determine the potential for HVP formation in a more biologically relevant system, we coinfected differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). We observed no difference in IAV replication kinetics between single-infected and coinfected cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In coinfections, RSV titres were variable, but the average titres over experimental replicates were lower than in single infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Trends in replication kinetics between single and mixed infections matched the trends observed in A549 cells, providing confidence that viral interactions are conserved between the two systems. To examine the spread of IAV and RSV in HBECs, we fixed and paraffin-embedded infected or mock-infected cultures (culture morphologies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>), and performed immunostaining using antibodies targeting IAV HA, IAV NP and a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole RSV virion. We observed diffuse staining for IAV HA and RSV across the apical layer of cells in single infections, whereas in coinfected cultures there was a high degree of individual cells infected by each virus as well as evidence of coinfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Analysis of individual coinfected cells revealed dual staining for both IAV and RSV antigens both at the apical surface of coinfected cells and within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e-f</xref>), providing an opportunity for interactions between IAV and RSV and the formation of HVPs.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Respiratory viruses share a common tropism for the human respiratory tract and cause significant disease burden. While there is increasing evidence that interactions amongst viruses play an important role on virus dynamics and transmission, most of what is known about virus biology and pathogenesis is based on a tractable but reductionist research approach whereby each virus is studied in isolation.</p><p id="P15">Recent work provided evidence that interactions among respiratory viruses occur and have measurable outcomes at multiple levels, from populations, to individuals and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, studies characterizing direct virus-virus interactions within cells are scarce. Here we describe previously unknown interactions between IAV and RSV, two clinically important respiratory viruses that belong to different taxonomical families.</p><p id="P16">We show that, in coinfections IAV replicates to equivalent or marginally higher titres compared to single IAV infections, whereas RSV replication is reduced. The consistency in IAV replication kinetics in the presence or absence of RSV contrasts with the inhibition of IAV replication in coinfections with rhinovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This indicates that the consequences of coinfections are highly dependent on the viruses involved as they trigger virus-specific cellular responses.</p><p id="P17">We also show compelling evidence that coinfections can generate infectious HVPs composed of structural, genomic, and functional components of both parental viruses. As HVPs can evade IAV-targeted neutralisation and infect cells lacking IAV receptors suggests that coinfections can generate viruses with altered antigenicity and expanded tropism. Using Palivizumab, we showed that RSV F mediates HVP entry, indicating that in the context of a hybrid particle, IAV can use the glycoprotein of an unrelated virus as its functional envelope protein. This property may facilitate within-host dissemination to areas of the respiratory tract that are refractory to infection by one of the parental viruses, which is likely to impact pathogenesis and disease outcome. For example, IAV predominantly infects the upper and middle respiratory tract causing uncomplicated influenza, while RSV spreads more readily to the middle and lower respiratory tract (LRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). HVPs could enable IAV to escape mucosal antibodies while spreading to the LRT, with subsequent potential complications, including viral pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In addition, as IAVs exhibit high mutation rates, LRT infections by HVPs might favor the selection of IAVs with increased tropism for the LRT and therefore result in selection of more pathogenic viruses.</p><p id="P18">In recent years, a novel conceptual framework that incorporates social evolution theory has been developed to explain how virus-virus interactions can play an important role on virus function and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We show that HVP formation is maintained over multiple rounds of infection and that HVPs facilitate the spread of IAV within a population of refractory cells. This observation aligns with the concept that, like other pathogens and organisms, viruses can engage in social-like traits, that are beneficial to virus fitness and function.</p><p id="P19">Using a lung-derived human cell line, we show that the generation of HVPs by coinfection is biologically feasible. The fact that IAV and RSV cocirculate in winter in the same populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), have a shared tropism for ciliated epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), bud from the apical cellular surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and coinfect cells within the respiratory epithelium (this work) suggest that HVPs have the potential to be generated <italic>in vivo.</italic> The likelihood of a cell becoming coinfected during natural infection remains unknown but will vary depending on the timing of infection and the localization of infectious foci within the respiratory tract. Estimates of viral bursts show that as viral load increases, the effective MOI to susceptible cells surrounding an infectious focus increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), enhancing the probability of cellular coinfection and therefore the potential generation of HVPs.</p><p id="P20">The formation of HVPs raises questions about fundamental rules that govern viral assembly and budding. These processes, which are thought to be highly regulated, involve selective recruitment, trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and multimerization of viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) within specific compartments of the cell. While we described the formation of HVPs as a consequence of coinfection by IAV and RSV, we hypothesize that coinfections involving other pleomorphic enveloped viruses are also likely to generate HVPs. However, we pose that formation of infectious HVPs requires more than structural compatibility, and includes similar tropism, absence of superinfection exclusion or interference, as well as seasonal and geographical co-circulation. RSV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a broad tropism for different regions of the respiratory tract and is frequently observed in co-infections in winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), therefore RSV is a good candidate to form HVPs with other respiratory viruses. This might explain some of the mechanisms that lead to viral pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Further studies will be required to address which virus combinations can generate infectious HVPs; which viral properties favor their formation; and how they impact on pathogenesis and virus transmission.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cells</title><p id="P21">Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], CCL-185), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC, CCL-34) and HEp-2 (ATCC, CCL-23) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Media (DMEM), high glucose, GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).</p><p id="P22">Human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC) were cultured and differentiated at air-liquid interface as describe previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).
