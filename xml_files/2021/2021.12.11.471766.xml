Traditionally, a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is suggested to coordinate these rhythms: neocortically-generated SOs trigger spindles in the thalamus that are projected back to neocortex. Here, we used intrathalamic recordings from human epilepsy patients to test this canonical interplay. We show that SOs in the anterior thalamus precede neocortical SOs (peak -50 ms), whereas concurrently-recorded SOs in the mediodorsal thalamus are led by neocortical SOs (peak +50 ms). Sleep spindles, detected in both thalamic nuclei, preceded their neocortical counterparts (peak -100 ms) and were initiated during early phases of thalamic SOs. Our findings indicate an active role of the anterior thalamus in organizing sleep rhythms in the neocortex and highlight the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei in humans. The thalamic coordination of sleep oscillations could have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The presence and coordinated interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles hallmarks non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

While a plethora of studies bolster the critical role of sleep oscillations and their coordinated interplay for the memory function of sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, the exact neural circuits enabling their complex orchestration across brain areas are less clear, ultimately impeding our understanding of the prime mechanistic vehicle of memory consolidation.</p><p id="P5">This is particularly striking with respect to the neural circuits facilitating memory consolidation in humans, since direct neural recordings from one of the key players, the thalamus, are scarce. The anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT) and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) have recently taken center-stage as thalamic key areas for different aspects of human memory functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and might therefore also play a key role in coordinating sleep oscillations relevant for memory consolidation. Leveraging the rare opportunity to record intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the human ANT and MD, together with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the interplay of NREM sleep oscillations within a thalamocortical network that is known to serve memory functions during wake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">We show that SOs in the ANT, but not the MD, lead neocortical SOs.

On average, participants slept for 8.82 ± 1.41 hours, with 63.51 ± 0.07 % spent in NREM sleep (stages N2 and N3; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for proportions of times spent in each stage, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Thalamic activity was recorded from the ANT and the MD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and methods for details on electrode localization). We isolated sleep oscillations from 27 bipolar intracranial thalamic channels (12 ANT; 15 MD) and scalp EEG electrodes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for details).To determine thalamo-cortical coordination during NREM sleep and their specificity, we detected SOs, spindles and SO-spindle events independently in thalamic iEEG (ANT &amp; MD) and scalp EEG recordings, assessed their coupling and delineated the temporal relationship of thalamo-cortical interactions (for descriptive values and characteristics see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3-6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>ANT SOs precede neocortical SOs</title><p id="P8">ANT SOs significantly preceded neocortical SOs, as revealed by occurrence probabilities of ANT SOs relative to neocortical SOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, positive cluster from -0.15 to 0.05 s, p &lt; 0.005; tested against event-free occurrence probabilities; corrected for multiple comparisons across time; neocortical SOs were derived from frontal scalp EEG electrodes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref> for details). ANT SO occurrence preferentially peaked, on average, briefly before the emergence of neocortical SOs (time of peak: -0.05 sec). To further validate this outcome, we specifically determined the phase of ANT SOs for all paired SO-events (i.e., all ANT SOs within ± 750 ms of neocortical SOs) at the time of neocortical SO down state (i.e., thalamo-cortical SO phase-phase coupling). We found significant nonuniform distributions in each of the ANT contacts (12/12) (p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>; Rayleigh test, mean vector length: 0.46 ± 0.05). Moreover, we found a significant nonuniform distribution across contacts (Rayleigh z = 10.95, p &lt; 0.0001), with the phase of ANT SOs being ahead of their neocortical counterparts (the phase of neocortical SO down states corresponds to ± π; mean coupling direction: −176.39 ± 4.94°; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To showcase the generic features of ANT and neocortical detected SOs, time-frequency representations (TFRs) of SO-locked neocortical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and ANT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) activity were contrasted against event-free events. TFRs time locked to scalp-derived SO down state peaks (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref> for details) exhibited the prototypical modulation of low frequency (&lt; 5 Hz) and spindle power (11–16 Hz) during SO events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In particular, low frequency power peaked before the SO down state. In contrast, spindle power was diminished during the down state, increased during the positive deflections of the SO and peaked during the SO up state (significant differences: p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons across time and frequency). Remarkably, while low frequency power for ANT derived SOs showed similar pre-down state increases, power in the spindle band (11-16 Hz) and beyond (&gt; 20 Hz) showed an early power increase tightly locked to the ANT SO down state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons across time and frequency).

Again, we determined the phase of thalamic SOs for all paired SO-events at the time of neocortical SO down state (± 750 ms). We found significant nonuniform distributions in all MD contacts (15/15, p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR; Rayleigh test, mean vector length: 0.41 ± 0.06) and a significant nonuniform distribution across contacts (Rayleigh z = 7.94, p = 0.0001), with the phase of MD SOs following their neocortical counterparts (mean coupling direction: 133.51 ± 10.91°; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

Finally, we directly assessed ANT – MD related SO interactions and tested whether ANT SOs would precede MD SOs (here occurrence probabilities were obtained for all possible ANT – MD combinations per participant, leading to 13 distributions). In line with the previous findings, results of this direct comparison revealed that ANT SOs preferentially emerge before MD SOs (positive cluster from -0.15 to 0 sec, p = 0.015; time of peak: -0.05 sec; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>).

However, it is unclear which of the many thalamic nuclei contribute to the generation of spindles and whether this translates to humans. Here, we show that the human ANT is putatively part of the spindle generating thalamic circuit, as ANT spindle occurrence peaked on average before the emergence of neocortical spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; positive clusters: -0.25 to 0.05 s, p &lt; 0.005 &amp; 0.15 to 0.2 s, p = 0.019; corrected for multiple comparisons across time; time of peak: -0.1 sec; neocortical spindles were derived from frontal, central or parietal scalp EEG electrodes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref> for details).</p><p id="P14">We further assessed the interplay of ANT and neocortical sleep spindles using a complementary analytical approach. Specifically, we tested to what extend spindle-related oscillatory power-modulations would precede those in the neocortex, by computing power-power correlations in the sleep spindle band (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">methods</xref> for details). We found a significant, off-diagonal cluster of temporal cross-correlations with regards to spindle power between ANT and neocortical sites (p = 0.004, cluster corrected across time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), supporting our initial finding that ANT spindles lead their neocortical counterparts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c and e</xref> depict the spindle-locked (time 0 = maximally negative amplitude) neocortical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and ANT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) related TFRs.

Overall, the relationship between MD spindles and neocortical spindles was highly similar to the relationship between ANT spindles and neocortical spindles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a + b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref> illustrates the scalp EEG grand average, locked to the neocortical sleep spindle peak. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref> illustrates the MD grand average, locked to the MD sleep spindle peak. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref> shows a comparison of ANT-neocortical and MD-neocortical interactions with regards to spindles.

In a complementary analytical approach, we determined the preferred phase of SO-spindle modulation (i.e., SO-spindle coupling), for both ANT and neocortical events, respectively, by assessing the SO phases corresponding to the spindle onset latencies in each contact / scalp electrode. In 12/12 ANT contacts we found significant nonuniform distributions (p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR; Rayleigh test, mean vector length: 0.41 ± 0.03) and a significant nonuniform distribution across contacts (Rayleigh z = 9.33, p &lt; 0.0001), with spindles starting near the SO down state (corresponding to ± 180°; mean coupling direction: −175.22° ± 6.92°; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>).

When directly comparing the preferred coupling phases between MD and neocortical areas, we found a significant difference (Watson-Williams test: F = 17.33; p = 0.0003), supporting the outcome that spindles in the MD start at earlier phases of the SO then neocortical spindles. We also quantified the directional influence of SOs on spindles in both MD and neocortical data, using the phase-slope index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

In particular, we found that SOs recorded in the human ANT preceded their neocortical counterparts (average peak: -50 ms), in contrast to SOs recorded in the MD, which were led by neocortical SOs (average peak: +50 ms). Spindles recorded in ANT as well as MD preceded neocortical spindles (average peak: -100 ms). Finally, both in the ANT and the MD, thalamic spindles locked to early SO-phases, facilitating the prototypical synchrony between SOs and spindles in the neocortex.</p><p id="P24">Sleep oscillations have gained considerable interest over the last decade, mainly due their presumed role in facilitating the memory function of sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. SOs are thought to represent the time-giving pacemakers of memory consolidation and have been studied extensively in both rodent models and during human sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Traditionally, they have been assumed to be solely generated within neocortical circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, recent animal studies cast doubt on this view by identifying essential thalamic contributions for SO generation and coordination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Thalamic neurons have been shown to exhibit intrinsic, rhythmic up and down states in isolated conditions (i.e., without neocortical inputs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>), while phasic burst-firing of thalamocortical neurons at the onset of up states often precedes the firing of neocortical neurons by 20 - 50 ms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical neurons efficiently initiates neocortical up states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, thalamic activity terminates SO up states synchronously across neocortical areas, thus mediating a well-controlled down state transition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In sum, these findings suggest that thalamic activity exerts a controlling influence on neocortical SOs, by coordinating up and down state dynamics in neocortical circuits. However, the generalization of thalamic contributions, and specifically of distinct thalamic nuclei, to sleep oscillations has been shown to be challenging across species (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>), prompting their direct assessment during human sleep.</p><p id="P25">To investigate potential contributions of the ANT to neocortical SO coordination, we detected SOs during NREM sleep in intracranial contacts located in the ANT as well as scalp EEG. We show that the ANT not only exhibits a slow oscillatory rhythm (note that the ANT signal is likely to be of local origin due to a bipolar montage), but, importantly, that ANT SOs precede their neocortical counterparts. This might indicate that the ANT guides SO activity in the neocortex. Focusing on paired events only (i.e., time-windows where both neocortical and ANT SOs were present), we found that ANT SO phases significantly lead neocortical SO phases. Notably, this pattern of results was specific to ANT recordings. SOs in the MD did not precede but rather followed neocortical SOs, which is in line with a previous report of neocortical SOs leading SOs in the human pulvinar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Our findings thus highlight both a specific role of the ANT for SO dynamics and, more generally, the functional diversity of specific thalamic nuclei in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, also with regards to sleep oscillations potentially originating there. Since scalp EEG recordings provide an indirect measure of the underlying cortical sources, one might ask whether a delay in cortical SOs relative to ANT SOs might be driven by effects of interjacent tissue (e.g., the skull) delaying the timing of the signal picked up at frontal scalp EEG channels. To mitigate these concerns, we show, in an independent data set, that intracranially recorded SOs in the frontal lobe exhibit no temporal delay with regards to SOs simultaneously recorded by frontal scalp EEG (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Another concern might arise considering volume conduction contaminating the thalamic signal. We used a bipolar montage for thalamic contacts to ensure a local origin of the signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, there might still be a possibility that the signal recorded from these contacts is contaminated by volume conducted activity from adjacent brain tissue outside the thalamus. We address this issue in a dedicated control analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) and conclude that none of these factors is likely to systematically bias our findings. The dissociation of SO timing between ANT and MD SOs, which are anatomical neighbors, also speaks against a global, volume conducted source driving the effects. In addition, our data were recorded in epilepsy patients in whom anti-epileptic medication and epileptiform events may affect sleep architecture and sleep related oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, warranting caution when generalizing to healthy population. However, our patient population was heterogeneous in terms of medication, age, epilepsy form and affected cortical area. Furthermore, sleep architecture and SO- and spindle quantity and densities were within normal ranges of healthy participants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary tables 3 and 4</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>), making it unlikely that a single aspect had a systematic impact on our results. In addition, while only seizure-free nights were included in the analysis, our strict artifact rejection procedure minimized the impact of epileptiform activity on our findings.</p><p id="P26">What makes the ANT a favorable candidate for sculpting neocortical SOs? The ANT is a key node in the limbic circuit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> and functionally relevant for human memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It has extensive connections with the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Notably, medial prefrontal regions, such as the orbitofrontal and the cingulate cortex have been identified as neocortical hot spots for the emergence of SO during human NREM sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, work in rodent models has shown that midline and anterior thalamic nuclei are likely candidates to influence global neocortical activity during sleep due to their widespread projections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, the dense connectivity of the ANT with medial prefrontal regions and within the limbic circuit sets the stage for ANT activity to shape neocortical SOs and coordinate sleep oscillations between regions implicated in memory consolidation.</p><p id="P27">We here show ANT SOs leading neocortical SOs on the basis of approximately 30% of neocortical SOs that were coupled to ANT SOs. Neocortical SOs that were not coupled to the ANT may as well have been initiated in the neocortex, in line with traditional accounts of the origin of SOs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Future research needs to investigate whether ANT coordinated SOs are functionally distinct from neocortically coordinated SOs, for example with respect to memory reprocessing during sleep. The precise coupling between SOs and thalamic spindles might be of relevance here, given that the precision of the coupling between SOs and spindles has been shown to be instrumental for memory consolidation to unfold (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>). Due to its prominent location within the limbic circuit and direct projections to the hippocampal formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, the ANT could also be important for integrating hippocampal ripples into SO-spindle complexes, facilitating the full triple-coupling of sleep oscillations that is assumed to mediate the memory functions of sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Hence, our work represents a starting point for elucidating the distinct role of the ANT in coordinating sleep oscillations and memory consolidation.</p><p id="P28">We also found clear evidence for spindles in ANT and MD. Spindles emerge in recurrent loops between the thalamic nucleus reticularis (TRN) and thalamocortical neurons, which in turn forward them to the neocortex and hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. There have been conflicting findings across animal species about whether the TRN innervates the ANT and, hence, whether or not spindles are present in the ANT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Our results provide a clear picture in humans: spindles are not only present both in the ANT and MD but also precede neocortical spindles, indicating an involvement of both nuclei in spindle generation and their projection to neocortical areas. In line with our interpretation, optogenetic stimulation of the rodent anterodorsal TRN, which innervates the ANT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, has been shown to initiate spindles in the neocortex and hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, indicating that the ANT might synchronize key areas of memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. With regards to the MD it has been found that its neurons exhibit increased firing during spindle events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> in rodents. In humans, reduced MD volume in persons with schizophrenia is associated with dampened neocortical spindle activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, further pointing towards a role of the MD in the thalamo-cortical spindle transfer. In line with previous work on spindles in posterior thalamic nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, we identify local and non-local spindles in ANT and MD. With respect to the neural circuitry generating spindles in ANT and MD, one could assume recurrent loops between TRN and thalamocortical neurons, similar to what has been shown in animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Extrapolating these findings from animals to humans needs to be done with caution, however, since result from animal models concerning TRN innervation of thalamic nuclei is not always univocal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In general, it is assumed that TRN is organized in sectors that topographically project to thalamic nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, which can explain why local spindles emerge in both MD and ANT. However, the mapping of TRN sections to thalamic nuclei is not one-to-one <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>: for example, some TRN sectors projecting to the MD also project to ANT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Such overlapping projections seem plausible when considering that MD and ANT thalamocortical neurons share common targets, for example in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p id="P29">In sum, our results extend previous research identifying sleep spindles in other human thalamic nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, by showing that sleep spindles in the ANT and MD precede neocortical spindles during human sleep, indicating a role of both nuclei in thalamo-cortical spindle projections.</p><p id="P30">Finally, we set out to characterize the properties of SO-spindle interactions within the ANT and the MD. Spindles tend to nest within SO up states in scalp EEG recordings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, the precise timing of neocortical spindle peaks with respect to the SO upstate has been shown to be tightly linked to the behavioral expressions of memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> putatively by igniting structural changes in neocortical sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Hence, the characteristics of SO-spindle interactions in the ANT might highlight how the thalamus simultaneously groups SOs and spindles in the neocortex, leading to the well-known oscillatory nesting (i.e., spindles nesting towards SO up-states). We found that spindles in the ANT were initiated around the thalamic SO down state, in contrast to neocortical spindles that preferentially started later, at the neocortical SO down to up state transition (leading to the well-known nesting of neocortical spindles towards the up states) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">Thus, ANT spindles started at significantly earlier ANT SO phases as compared to neocortical SO-spindle interactions. Notably, this divergent property of SO-spindle coordination in the ANT is a consequence of the delays between ANT and cortical sleep oscillations we found. It allows spindles, putatively generated in the ANT, to arrive during SO up-states on neocortical sites, generating the prototypical SO-spindle coupling found in scalp EEG. Specifically, while we show that both ANT SOs and spindles preceded their neocortical counterparts, the time lag between ANT and neocortical spindles exceeded the time lag between ANT and neocortical SOs (100 ms vs. 50 ms). Hence, to enable the prototypical SO-spindle modulation in neocortical circuits (i.e., nesting of spindles towards the SO upstate) under the assumption that both graph-elements in the neocortex are governed by the ANT, it is inevitable that spindles start at relatively earlier phases of the SO in the ANT as compared to spindles of neocortical SO-spindle complexes. Without such a shifted coordination on the thalamic level, cortical SO-spindle coupling would be systematically misaligned, with spindles regularly peaking after SO up-states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> for a schematic illustration).</p><p id="P32">We found a similar pattern of SO-spindle interactions within the MD, with spindles starting at early phases of the SO. Interestingly, even though not significant, spindles in the MD seem to start even earlier with respect to SOs as it is the case in the ANT. Again, in order to project spindles to the neocortex that nest in neocortical up states in a timely manner, a shifted coordination of SOs and spindles in the MD is necessary (i.e., spindles starting at early SO phases). This seems to be even more relevant in the case of the MD, where SOs were preceded (and potentially driven) by neocortical SOs, while spindles preceded neocortical spindles. Hence, for MD spindles to arrive at the neocortex during the presence of an SO-upstate, it is inevitable to start at an early MD SO-phase. The tight coupling of thalamic spindles to thalamic down-states is in line with previous work showing a very similar temporal relationship in the human pulvinar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the hyperpolarization during thalamic down-states is required to trigger the neuronal cascade underlying spindle generation.</p><p id="P33">Taken together, our findings provide first evidence for the ANT as a major hub for coordinating the cardinal NREM-sleep related oscillations. In the neocortex, both spindles and SOs were led by ANT-related activity, while the interplay of local ANT SO-spindles was tuned in a way that allows for neocortical spindles to nest within SO up states (ANT spindles starting at early ANT SO phases, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Importantly, this exact coordination is thought to be instrumental for the consolidation of memories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Hence, the ANT might represent a key-player in governing memory re-processing during human NREM sleep. Due to its projections to the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, the ANT has already been implicated in facilitating memory functioning and spatial navigation during wake, putatively by facilitating hippocampal-neocortical interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Notably, the same hippocampal-cortical dialogue is assumed to underly sleep-related memory consolidation, facilitated by a precise coupling of hippocampal ripples, neocortical SOs and thalamic spindles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The standard model suggests that neocortical SOs are imposed on a rather passive thalamus, where they initiate spindles. Spindles in turn are thought to synchronize hippocampal ripples and reactivated memory information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Through this coordination the reactivated memory information is suggested to arrive at the neocortex during periods of high plasticity (i.e., during the presence of SO up states and spindles) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Our data critically extend these theoretical considerations, by spotlighting the human thalamus, and in specific the ANT, as a putative active agent in interfacing sleep-related oscillations between brain regions and thereby, potentially facilitating memory consolidation. While our current data remain agnostic with regards to hippocampal activity, it has been shown in a single patient study, that hippocampal spindles are aligned with SOs in the ANT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Hence, ANT related oscillations might not only migrate to the neocortex but likewise to the hippocampus, where spindles are known to govern ripples and associated memory reactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.Taken together, ANT related activity might critically contribute to the triple-coupling of sleep oscillations and thus, the memory function of sleep.

Four thalamic contacts (2 ANT contacts, 2 MD contacts) and on average 7.5 ± 0.92 scalp electrodes were discarded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Event detection</title><p id="P45">SOs and sleep spindles were identified for each patient, based on established detection algorithms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S18"><title>SO detection</title><p id="P46">Data were filtered between 0.3-2 Hz (two-pass FIR bandpass filter, order = three cycles of the low frequency cut-off). Only movement-free data (as determined during sleep scoring) from NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 were considered. All zero-crossings were determined in the filtered signal of each channel (iEEG and scalp EEG, respectively), and event duration was determined for SO candidates (that is, down states followed by up states) as time between two successive positive- to-negative zero-crossings. Events that met the SO duration criteria (minimum of 0.8 and maximum of 2 sec) and exceeded the mean amplitude of all detected events by 1.25 SD entered the analysis. For subsequent time-locked analyses (ERPs, time-frequency representations, etc.), 5-sec-long segments centered on the down state (± 2.5 sec) were extracted from the unfiltered raw signal.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Spindle detection</title><p id="P47">Data was filtered between 11–16 Hz (two-pass FIR bandpass filter, order = three cycles of the low frequency cut-off). Again, only artifact-free data from NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 were used for event detection. The root mean square (RMS) signal was calculated for the filtered signal at each channel using a moving average of 200 ms, and spindles that exceeded the mean amplitude of all detected events by 1.5 SD entered the analysis. Whenever the signal exceeded this threshold for more than 0.5 sec but less than 3 sec (duration criteria), a spindle event was detected. Spindle onsets were defined as the points in time when the signal initially crossed the threshold. Epochs time-locked to the maximally negative spindle trough (−2.5 to +2.5 sec) were extracted from the unfiltered raw signal for subsequent time-locked analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>SO-spindle complexes</title><p id="P48">To isolate SO-spindle complexes in scalp and thalamic recordings, we determined for all SOs whether a spindle was detected following the SO (SO down state + 750 ms). Again, SO-spindle events were extracted (−2.5 to +2.5 sec with regards to the SO down state) from the raw signal for subsequent time-locked analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Paired events</title><p id="P49">To identify paired SO events (scalp &amp; thalamus), we determined for all scalp detected SOs whether corresponding SOs were detectable in thalamic recordings within a time-window of ± 750 ms. Data segments locked to the scalp detected down states (± 2.5 sec) were extracted. Likewise, paired sleep spindles were isolated by determining for all scalp detected sleep spindles whether related spindles emerged (± 750 ms) in thalamic recordings. Data segments locked to the scalp detected maximally negative spindle peak (± 2.5 sec) were extracted.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Electrode selection [scalp EEG]</title><p id="P50">As outlined above, all electrodes exhibiting significant epileptic activity were discarded to ensure that our results were not influenced by epileptiform activity. This conservative procedure together with restricted access to the scalp due to post-surgical wound care impeded us from using identical scalp EEG electrodes across patients to delineate thalamo-cortical interactions during sleep (e.g., electrode Fz for SO related and electrode Cz for sleep spindle related analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Instead, we pursued a data-driven and individualized approach. For SO-related analyses, we selected for each participant the frontal scalp electrode that exhibited the highest number of associated thalamic SOs within a time of ± 750 ms. This procedure was accomplished independently for data stemming from the ANT and the MD. The respective scalp electrodes (one related to the ANT, one related to the MD) were used for all subsequent SO-related analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for on overview of the selected scalp electrode; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> for ANT SO occurrence probabilities relative to scalp electrode Fz; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> for ANT SO occurrence probabilities relative to occipital scalp electrodes). Similarly, for sleep spindle related analyses, we selected the frontal, central or parietal scalp electrode that exhibited the highest number of associated thalamic spindles (ANT or MD, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for on overview of the selected scalp electrodes; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> for spindle-spindle occurrence probabilities, were scalp spindles were exclusively derived from frontal or parietal electrodes; for slow and fast spindle related results see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10, 11 and Supplementary table 9</xref>). The respective scalp electrodes (one related to the ANT, one related to the MD) were subsequently used for all sleep spindle-related analyses. Data from scalp electrodes was used as a proxy of neocortical activity.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Event-free segments</title><p id="P51">For statistical comparisons, we extracted 5-sec-long intervals during NREM sleep, which did not exhibit any SO, spindle or SO-spindle event, respectively. In each participant and electrode, the number of control events corresponded to the number of prior detected events of interest. Event-free events were only drawn from time window starting 5 mins before and ending 5 mins after the corresponding oscillatory event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Analyses</title><sec id="S25"><title>Temporal relation between sleep oscillations</title><p id="P52">To assess the temporal relationship between scalp- and thalamus-derived SO events, we created peri-event time histograms (bin size = 50 ms) where scalp detected SO down states served as seed (time = 0), while the targets (thalamic SO down states) are depicted relative to the seed. The resulting histogram was normalized by the total number of detected scalp SOs (multiplied by 100) per participant and electrode site. Similarly, for sleep spindles, peri-event histograms (bin size = 50 ms) of thalamic sleep spindle peaks (maximally negative amplitude) in relation to scalp sleep spindles peaks (maximally negative amplitude: ± 1.5 sec) were created. The resulting histogram was normalized by the total number of detected scalp spindles (multiplied by 100). To determine the interplay of SOs and sleep spindles (separately within scalp and thalamic recording), a peri-event histogram of sleep spindles (onsets) around SO down states (± 1.5 sec) was created. The resulting histogram was normalized by the total number of detected spindles (multiplied by 100). The same procedure was applied to spindle-free control segments.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Phase relationship between sleep oscillations</title><p id="P53">To estimate the phase-relationship between scalp and thalamic SOs, data epochs including paired events were filtered in the SO range (0.3–2 Hz, two-pass Butterworth bandpass filter). As described above, these segments included both scalp and thalamic SOs, and were time-locked to the down states of scalp detected SOs. A Hilbert transform was applied to the data and the instantaneous phase angle of the thalamic recording at the time of the scalp SO down state was extracted. Each participant’s preferred phase of SO-SO coupling was then obtained by taking the circular mean of all individual events’ preferred phases.</p><p id="P54">For the analysis of SO-spindle coupling, we filtered the SO-spindle data (locked to spindle onsets) in the SO range (0.3–2 Hz, two-pass Butterworth bandpass filter), applied a Hilbert transform and extracted the instantaneous phase angle. Next, we isolated the SO phase angle at the time of spindle onsets. Each participant’s t preferred SO phase at spindle onsets was obtained by taking the circular mean of all individual events’ preferred phases.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Spindle related across-channel power correlations</title><p id="P55">We further estimated the temporal relationship of thalamic and scalp detected spindles using channel to channel correlations of oscillatory power in the sleep spindle band. To this end, a Hanning window was applied to paired sleep spindles segments (locked to scalp detected maximally negative amplitude) and power values between 11 and 16 Hz were extracted for each time-bin. Power values were z-scored per channel and averaged. Subsequently, power values derived from thalamic channels were correlated with scalp related power values at each time-point (Spearman correlation), resulting in a 2d correlation map per contact pair. Finally, the correlation maps were normalized using the Fisher z-transform. The same procedure was applied to spindle-free control segments. Off-diagonal correlations indicate a time-lag between spindle power in scalp and thalamic channels.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Phase Slope Index</title><p id="P56">We assessed whether SOs drive activity in the sleep spindle range or vice versa in NREM sleep data segments comprising SO-spindle complexes, separately for thalamic and scalp recordings. The cross-frequency phase-slope index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, was calculated for each contact between the signal and the signal filtered in the sleep spindle range (11 – 16 Hz). After applying a Hanning window and extracting the complex Fourier coefficients, all SO frequencies &lt; 2 Hz were considered. In this context, positive values indicate SOs driving sleep spindle activity, while negative values indicate sleep spindles driving SOs. The obtained data distributions were tested against zero, using paired samples t-tests.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Time frequency representations</title><p id="P57">Time–frequency analyses of SO, sleep spindle and SO-spindle segments were performed using FieldTrip <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Frequency decomposition of the data was achieved using Fourier analysis based on sliding time windows (moving forward in 50 ms increments). The window length was set to five cycles of a given frequency (frequency range: 1–30 Hz in 1 Hz steps). The windowed data segments were multiplied with a Hanning taper before Fourier analysis [−2.5 to 2.5 sec]. The longer time segments were chosen to allow for resolving low frequency activity within the time windows of interest [−1.5 to 1.5 sec] and avoid edge artifacts. Resulting power values were z-scored across time. The same procedure was applied to event-free control segments.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P58">Statistical analyses were performed at the individual electrodes / contacts level (fixed-effects analysis), considering all electrodes / contacts that were eligible based on our criteria (e.g., artefact free, etc.). Unless stated otherwise, we used cluster-based permutation tests to correct for multiple comparisons as implemented in fieldtrip. A dependent-samples t-test was used at the sample level and values were thresholded at p = 0.05 (1000 randomizations). The sum of all t-values in cluster served as cluster statistic and Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the cluster p-value (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed) under the permutation distribution. The input data were either occurrence probabilities across time (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), time x frequency values (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) or time x time correlation maps (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) which were tested against corresponding data stemming from event-free events. In case of between area comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>) independent samples t-tests (cluster corrected) were employed to conform with the varying number of observation units (i.e., contacts).</p><p id="P59">For circular statistics the phase distributions (within or across participants) were tested against uniformity using the Rayleigh test (CircStat toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>).
