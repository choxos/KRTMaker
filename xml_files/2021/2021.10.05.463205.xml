<abstract>
<p id="P1">COVID-19 is a multi-system disease affecting many organs outside of the lungs, and patients generally develop varying degrees of neurological symptoms.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multi-organ disease. Although the symptoms of COVID-19 are predominantly concentrated in human respiratory system, obvious organs dysfunction outside of the lungs are detected, including intestine, heart, kidney, liver and brain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Of note, accumulating clinical evidences showed 30-40% COVID-19 patients develop obvious neurological symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, psychosis, hypogeusia, hyposmia, cerebrovascular injury, seizures and encephalitis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In human brain, there is a highly selective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which controls the transport of nutrients and metabolites between the systemic circulation and the nervous system <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Also, BBB functions as a protective barrier to prevent toxins and pathogens (including virus) from accessing the brain parenchyma. In some brain infectious diseases, neurotropic viruses can infect and disrupt BBB, and further invade human brain through the hematogenous route, such as HSV-1 and Zika virus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can cross BBB to invade brain through the similar route remains elusive.</p>
<p id="P3">In the past year, great efforts have been made to investigate the influences of SARS-CoV-2 on brains. By examining autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, several pathological studies revealed cerebral injuries in patients’ brains, such as cerebrovascular damage and glial activation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Some studies using animal models, reported SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in brains after intranasal administration of virus, indicating potential neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. As a new type of <italic>in vitro</italic> model, brain organoids contain multiple cell types and have been widely used in studies of the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, showing different susceptibility of various brain cells for the viral infection, including neurons, neural progenitor cells and astrocytes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. However, some limitations constrain interpretations of these studies. As for autopsy brain tissues, limited availability of samples from COVID-19 patients and variability in patient presentation restricts their large-scale application <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Classic animal models, such as rodents, are different from humans in physiological structure, and are limited in accurately recapitulating neuropathological changes of COVID-19 in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Regarding brain organoids, functional brain barriers and immune cells are absent, which makes it difficult to accurately recapitulate viral exposure and host immune responses in a physiological state. Especially, given that COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease, and damaged organs are closely associated during disease pathogenesis. Human organ models that can reflect pathological changes at systematic level is still lacking.</p>
<p id="P4">Microfluidic organ chip models, emerging as <italic>in vitro</italic> microphysiological systems, possess the potential to recreate functional units from the native human organs or tissues. It can resemble the organ physiology in a human-relevant manner by mimicking the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like cellular microenvironment factors, such as cell-cell interactions and mechanical fluid flow. This technology has been developed to create a variety of organ models, such as the lung, liver, heart and BBB <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>, holding great potential in disease modeling and drug testing. More recently, several organ chips have been leveraged to study host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the antiviral effect of candidate drugs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">In this study, we proposed a new strategy to create a linked alveolus-BBB chip platform that allows to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human BBB in a multi-organ context. The multi-organ chip platform was created by linking an alveolus chip and BBB chip via fluidic control. Human peripheral blood immune cells were introduced into the multi-organ platform to simulate the cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2-induced lung infection. Our study showed, direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure had no visible effects on BBB chip alone. While, SARS-CoV-2 induced BBB injury and inflammation indirectly following the systematic inflammation caused by lung infection on the linked chip platform. Collectively, our findings provide a possible explanation for pathogenesis underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological symptoms, which does not result from direct viral infection through hematogenous route, but rather likely from systemic inflammation following lung infection.</p>

<title>Establishing a linked human alveolus-BBB chip platform for studies of viral infection</title>
<p id="P6">COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease. Although lung is the major target organ for SARS-CoV-2, obvious neurological symptoms can be diagnosed in a large population of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human brains in an organ-organ context, we plan to establish a linked human alveolus-BBB organ chip model system that enables to recapitulate the essential features of human alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier in a physiologically relevant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">The human alveolus chip consisted of an upper epithelial channel and a lower vascular channel separated by a porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane (10 μm thick, 2 μm diameter). The alveolar-capillary barrier interface was established by co-culturing human alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HULEC-5a) on the porous membrane (precoated with fibronectin) under microfluidic condition (100 μL/h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">In human brain, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are the primary anatomical component of the BBB and line the brain capillaries. They work in concert with basement membrane, perivascular astrocytes and pericytes, as well as neighboring neurons and microglia to form the neurovascular unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. To reconstitute the human BBB <italic>in vitro</italic>, we fabricated a microfluidic BBB chip, which consisted of an upper vascular channel and a parallel CNS channel separated by the porous PET membrane. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytes (HA) were seeded on the opposite sides of porous membrane, mimicking the BBB interface <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the human microglial cells (HMC3) were cultured on the lower side of CNS channel. Both channels were perfused at a flow velocity of 100 μL/h for 3 days. Side view of confocal microscopic images revealed an intact tissue interface was formed on the porous membrane identified by VE-cadherin (adherens junction protein) in brain endothelial cells and GFAP (astrocytic marker) in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), and a microglial layer (IBA1) was formed on the bottom side of CNS channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). In brain endothelium, well developed adherens junctions (VE-cadherin) and tight junctions (ZO-1) were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). As for glial cells, obvious astrocyte markers (GFAP, S100β) and microglial markers (IBA1, CD11b) were detected on the astrocytic layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>) and microglial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>), respectively. These results reveal the integrity of BBB interface was formed under the microfluidic condition.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Direct exposure of SARS-CoV-2 showed no visible effects on BBB chip alone</title>
<p id="P9">In order to evaluate the viral invasiveness to human brain via infecting BBB, we conducted direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure test on individual BBB chip. The individual alveolus chip was infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=1) in parallel as a positive control. For SARS-CoV-2 exposure test on BBB chip, we chose a MOI (MOI=1) that is much higher than physiological amount of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in peripheral blood for human brains. Initially, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells which SARS-CoV-2 utilizes for cellular entry, was determined by Western blot. It appeared both proteins were expressed most highly in HPAEpiC cells (human alveolar epithelial type II cells-derived cell line), followed by two vascular endothelial cell lines (HULEC-5a, HBMEC) and glial cell lines (HA, HMC3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was consistent with scRNA-seq analysis that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically highly co-expressed in human alveolar epithelial type II cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p id="P10">Three days post-infection, obvious infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the individual alveolus chip identified by viral Spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), which was consistent with our previous study <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. However, no obvious SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on the individual BBB chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). No visible changes in BBB permeability were observed following direct viral exposure either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In brain endothelial cells, adherent junctions visualized by VE-cadherin were well preserved in the infected chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the lower CNS channel of the infected chip, no viral infection and cell morphological changes were observed in both astrocytes and microglia as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 replication in BBB is very low and below the limits of detection by immunofluorescence, culture mediums of infected BBB chips were analyzed by qRT-PCR for viral RNA detection, which is a more sensitive method. The result showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), viral loads of infected BBB chips were much lower than those of infected alveolus chips, indicating BBB is less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 direct infection, and the probability of direct neuroinvasion via BBB is low.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 caused BBB injury indirectly following lung infection on the linked chip platform</title>
<p id="P12">As direct viral exposure of SARS-CoV-2 had no visible effects on BBB chip alone, we then assumed neuropathological changes may be caused by the systematic inflammation following lung infection in an indirect manner.</p>
<p id="P13">To verify the hypothesis, we initially collected endothelial medium from the mock- or SARS-CoV-2 infected human alveolus chips (MOI=1), and then utilized it as conditional medium to treat BBB chips. Here, we chose influenza H1N1 virus (PR8 strain), as a reference in parallel (MOI=1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce a cytokine storm that commonly happens in severe COVID-19 cases, cytokines in culture supernatants of alveolus chips were detected 4 days after infection. The results showed 10 cytokines (including IFN-α2, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-7, IL-1RA, IL-8, TNF-α, CXCL10, CCL3 and IL-10) were significantly released in the epithelial channels of SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus chip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, although no obvious SARS-CoV-2 replication in the pulmonary endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), obvious cytokines release (including IL-7, CXCL10, CCL3 and IL-10) was still detected in the endothelial channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>), mimicking the SARS-CoV-2-indcued cytokine storm <italic>in vivo</italic>. Compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection, H1N1 virus infection caused a milder increase of cytokines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Then, the collected pulmonary endothelial medium was diluted with twice volume of fresh endothelial medium, and infused it into the vascular channel of BBB chips for continued culture. 4 days later, permeability assay showed infusion of endothelial medium from SARS-CoV-2-infected human alveolus chips induced a significant increase in BBB permeability, with a less increase in H1N1 virus group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">As brain microvascular endothelial cells are the core anatomical component of BBB, tight junctions and adherens junctions play critical roles in keeping adjacent endothelial cells close together and preventing paracellular diffusion. We then detected the tight junctions and adherens junction following conditional medium treatment, and the results showed endothelial tight junctions and adherens junctions were severely disrupted, as indicated by altered ZO-1 and VE-cadherin organization, with a lesser change in H1N1 virus group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Also, the endothelial cell density showed an obvious decrease in SARS-CoV-2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 induced glial activation and neuroinflammation on the linked organ chip platform</title>
<p id="P16">To monitor the conditions of astrocytes and microglia following conditional medium treatment, glial cells were examined by staining with cell-specific markers. Confocal microscopic analysis showed, both astrocytic markers (GFAP, S100β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and microglial markers (IBA1 and CD11b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) were significantly up-regulated in SARS-CoV-2 group, while without obvious changes in H1N1 virus group. Intriguingly, in SARS-CoV-2 group, we noticed many microglia were distributed in cluster, resembling the focal microglial activation <italic>in vivo</italic> characterized by microglial nodules <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Besides, many lamellipodia (enlarged area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) were observed in the microglia of SARS-CoV-2 group, and similar phenomenon of activated microglia were also reported in previous studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. Consistently, the mRNA level of GFAP, S100β, IBA1 and CD11b were all specifically up-regulated in SARS-CoV-2 group by qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Besides, cytokine assay showed 10 cytokines (including IL-6, MCP-1, G-CSF, IL-2, IL-7, IL-1RA, IL-8, TNF-α, CCL3 and IL-10) were significantly released by the glial cells (CNS channel) in SARS-CoV-2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Since astrocytes and microglia were activated following pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection, we then investigated whether the activated glial cells were involved in the BBB damage, especially the brain endothelium disruption. Here, we ablated the astrocytes or microglia from the BBB chip, and examined their influences on brain endothelium following SARS-CoV-2 infection. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> showed, 4 days after infusion of endothelial medium from SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus chip, astrocytes or microglia ablation couldn’t restore the normal cell periphery distribution of VE-cadherin and ZO-1. However, astrocytes ablation partially ameliorated the brain endothelial cell detachment from the porous membrane, while microglia ablation showed a weaker rescue effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). These results suggested, activated glial cells, especially activated astrocytes, exacerbated brain endothelial damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection on the linked chip platform.</p>
<p id="P18">As the resident immune cells of nervous system, microglia play vital roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis, and responses to injury or infection. Upon activation, microglia can dynamically change their status into M1 phenotype (proinflammatory) or M2 phenotype (anti-inflammatory), a process termed as polarization <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. To define the status of microglia during BBB damage, we examined the marker expressions of M1 or M2 microglia by staining F4/80 and CD206, respectively. A significant increase in F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells (M1 marker) were observed in SARS-CoV-2 group, with no obvious change for CD206<sup>+</sup> cells (M2 marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), which indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted M1 microglial polarization and induced neuroinflammation.</p>
<p id="P19">In addition to glial cells, peripheral immune cells may also participate in the BBB injury. To evaluate their roles, endothelial medium from SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus chips containing ~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PBMCs (pre-stained with Cell Tracker Red dye) were infused into the vascular channel of BBB chips, and 2 days later, the recruitment of peripheral immune was assessed by the PBMCs binding to the brain endothelium. The results showed, conditional medium treatment only leaded to a slight increase of PBMCs attachment on endothelium in the early stage of BBB injury (P value&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E, F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">All these findings indicated, SARS-CoV-2 could induce BBB injury and glial cell activation indirectly, which may be mediated by systematic inflammation after lung infection. Once the glial cells were activated, they exacerbated brain endothelial injury in turn and induced more severe inflammation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P21">COVID-19 is a systematic disease with multi-organ symptoms, and neurological symptoms are common in a large population of patients. In this study, we proposed a new strategy to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human brains in a linked chip platform. This linked chip platform was established by combining a human alveolar chip with a human BBB chip, and enabled to recapitulate the basic features of alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results revealed, direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure to vascular side had no visible effects on the BBB chip alone, while it can lead to disrupted BBB and neuroinflammation following lung infection indirectly on the linked chip platform. These new findings suggested the neurological alterations in COVID-19 may not be caused by direct viral neuroinvasion, but rather likely are the consequences of systematic inflammation following lung infection.</p>
<p id="P22">The pathological changes of central nervous system in COVID-19 patients have raised great concern. Many studies uncovered neurological changes by examining autopsy brain samples from COVID-19 patients, and some of our findings are consistent with these pathological reports. A study reported, cerebral injuries, such as hypoxic/ischemic damage, hemorrhage and glial activation, can be detected in COVID-19 brain samples, whereas RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Even though qRT-PCR examination showed low or trace levels of viral RNA in some COVID-19 brains, the levels of detectable virus were not associated with the severity of neuropathological alterations <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, a recent study of single-nucleus transcriptomes revealed no molecular traces of virus in the frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples of COVID-19 patients either <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. All these findings indicated, the direct viral neuroinvasion may not be the prerequisite for the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Notably, some pathological responses detected in our organ chip model, such as activated astrocytes with high degree of GFAP expression and activated microglia distributed in microglial nodules, were reminiscent of the similar phenomenon in brain tissues of COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>, which verified the feasibility of our model in recapitulating neurological alterations in patients.</p>
<p id="P23">In human, BBB functions as a protective interface, prevents toxins and pathogens (including virus) from accessing the brain parenchyma. In regard to the viral neuroinvasion, several organoid models have been utilized to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and viral entry route to human brains <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, however, some limitations constrain interpretation of these studies. As these brain organoids have not realized vascularization and lack a functional BBB interface, making it difficult to accurately recapitulate the viral exposure in physiological state. Besides, no immune cells (such as peripheral blood immune cells, microglial cells) were present in these brain organoids, which made it unsuitable to evaluate the host immune responses and the impacts of systematic inflammation on brain following SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P24">Compared with other <italic>in vitro</italic> models, the major advantage of this platform is the capability to introduce various of cell types or tissues according to research needs, such as immune cells, tissue interfaces and vasculatures. As for COVID-19, although immune cells and vascular endothelial cells are not the primary attack targets for virus, they contribute a lot to disease progression and some lifethreatening complications, such as inflammatory responses, systemic vasculitis and venous thromboembolism et al. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. In this model system, peripheral blood immune cells were introduced into the alveolus chips, and robust inflammatory cytokines release was detected following SARS-CoV-2 infection, mimicking the cytokine storms commonly happening in severe COVID-19 cases. In our previous study on human alveolus chip model alone, the inclusion of peripheral immune cells significantly exacerbated the cytokines release and SARS-CoV-2-induced alveolar injury <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Regarding vascular endothelial cells, our studies revealed exposure to the pulmonary endothelial medium containing pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered a second release of cytokines and chemokines in the vascular channel of BBB chips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Through this amplification loop of inflammatory response, the brain endothelium constituted a significant source of inflammatory cytokines in human brains, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α that characterize the cytokine storm in COVID-19. All these findings indicated immune cells and endothelial cells are two major characters involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis.</p>
<p id="P25">It’s worth noting that, in the study we only discussed one potential entry route of SARS-CoV-2 to human brains actually. In addition to BBB, there is another barrier system in human central nervous system: blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B-CSF-B), which separates the stroma capillaries from the CSF <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Compared with the highly selective and insulated BBB, the B-CSF-B is much simpler, and formed by a single epithelial layer of the choroid plexus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Two groups reported, SARS-CoV-2 can infect choroid plexus epithelial cells and invade human brains by disrupting B-CSF-B <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Some pathological studies also reported viral RNA can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid or brains of some COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. However, the presence of virus in human brains or CSF is not a widely reported finding, especially compared with the huge population of COVID-19 patients suffering neurological symptoms. Based on the studies using the linked organ chip platform, we proposed that neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is not the prerequisite of neuropathological alteration in COVID-19 patients, and systematic inflammation is sufficient to induce BBB disruption and neuroinflammation in humans. In the course of disease progression, BBB sensed and relayed peripheral inflammation into the brain parenchyma, and the activated glial cells exacerbated the neuroinflammation.</p>
<p id="P26">Collectively, this work provided a proof of concept to utilize a linked organ chip model to study the influences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human brains in an organ-organ context. This <italic>in vitro</italic> model system can not only simulate physiologically relevant structures and functions of biological barriers in a biomimetic microfluidic condition, but also recapitulate the complex pathophysiological changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We envision this microengineered linked organ model can provide a unique platform for the study of host-virus interactions, infection mechanisms and drug testing in particularly for virology research.</p>
