Receptors form dynamic assemblies or clusters that modulate downstream signaling and the final physiological response. Upon activation, these receptors undergo transitions from freely diffusing monomers to less mobile nanoclusters and further to higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ojosnegros <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Su <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). In signal transduction, the mechanisms for receptor cluster formation and cluster behavior have become physiologically relevant topics. However, the role of mesoscale (hundreds of nanometers) receptor organization in signal transduction remains unsolved, mainly because techniques to trigger receptor clustering <italic>in situ</italic> and monitor this assembly process in real-time are largely limited.</p><p id="P3">Nano- and microlithographic approaches have provided cell-compatible scaffolds to investigate confined ligand-receptor interactions.

Recently, optogenetics and optochemistry have provided the possibility of targeting receptor oligomerization with high spatiotemporal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bardhan &amp; Deiters, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Goglia &amp; Toettcher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Taslimi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). However, approaches that can be easily adapted to a variety of receptors or experimental setups and that offer the ability to analyze large cell populations simultaneously are rare.</p><p id="P4">Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCR) are key cell surface proteins that regulate a plethora of cellular responses to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hilger <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Venkatakrishnan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wootten <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). The Y<sub>2</sub> receptor (Y<sub>2</sub>R) is one of the four human neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor subtypes, which belong to the rhodopsin-like (class A) GPCR superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Parker &amp; Balasubramaniam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Y<sub>2</sub>R is linked to many important physiological processes, such as fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Méndez-Couz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>), regulation of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Huang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>), and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lafferty <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Y<sub>2</sub>R activation by neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to promote cell migration and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ekstrand <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Movafagh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). It has been recently demonstrated that Y<sub>2</sub>Rs respond to light-guided microscale clustering at spatially defined locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sánchez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Y<sub>2</sub>Rs are activated independently of canonical ligands, evoking elevated cytosolic calcium, a change in cell spreading behavior, and a localized migratory pattern.</p><p id="P5">Here, we established a versatile approach for <italic>in situ</italic> receptor clustering using a multivalent chelator nanotool (<italic>tris</italic> N-nitrilotriacetic acid, <italic>tris</italic>NTA), which displays high affinity for histidine (His)-tagged proteins. The nanometer size of the tool in combination with pre-structured matrices enabled receptor clustering with high spatiotemporal resolution. The lateral organization of Y<sub>2</sub>Rs in living cells was controlled within minutes in a non-invasive and ligand-independent manner. Microscale receptor clusters with a high degree of homogeneity in size and density were generated at the plasma membrane. Analysis of the receptor mobility revealed a dynamic assembly with fast exchange of the receptors within the confined areas in contrast to the static clustering induced by an anti-His-tag antibody on the same matrix. Nanotool-induced receptor clustering triggered ligand-independent activation of signal transduction, as evidenced by an increase in cytosolic calcium and cell motility, effects also observed in ligand-induced receptor activation. Moreover, we demonstrated an amplification of the signal upon ligand-induced activation in cells pre-clustered with the nanotool. As additional downstream event, we uncovered high arrestin-3 (Arr3) co-recruitment to the patterned areas only in the presence of the canonical ligand, suggesting an Arr3-independent desensitization mechanism for the ligand-independent response. Compared to standard micropatterning techniques, this generic approach advances ligand-free receptor signaling studies, with the advantage that large cell populations can be imaged simultaneously, and no expensive equipment is required for implementation. The versatile nanotool can be adapted to a variety of systems and receptors through minimal modifications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In situ</italic> receptor clustering by a multivalent nanotool</title><p id="P6">We developed a system to induce dynamic receptor assembly <italic>in situ</italic> based on a multivalent chelator <italic>tris</italic>NTA nanotool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is equipped with a biotin moiety (<italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> displays a high affinity for His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> ≈ 1-10 nM), resulting in a site-specific but reversible interaction with minimal steric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gatterdam <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>).

However, reproducible patterned substrates with a generic structure over extensive millimeter dimensions which allow simultaneous analyses of large cell populations are difficult to produce. We used a large-area perfluoropolyether (PFPE) elastomeric stamps inked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to print 96-well size glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hager <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lanzerstorfer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Wells within these plates containing a BSA-structured matrix were functionalized with biotinylated BSA (biotin-BSA) and streptavidin (SA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequent functionalization with the nanotool and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fluorescent proteins resulted in well-resolved protein patterns that were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results confirmed the specificity of the nickel-loaded <italic>tris</italic>NTA chelator to capture His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins in defined regions of 1 μm or 3 μm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The ability to control the organization of membrane receptors <italic>in situ</italic> is important for dissecting the spatial complexity of cell signaling and the extracellular environment. With this aim, we established a monoclonal human cervical cancer HeLa cell line expressing low amounts of Y<sub>2</sub>R (~300,000 receptors/cell) utilizing a tetracycline-inducible (T-Rex) expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sánchez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>).

It is important to mention that these modifications do not affect receptor activity, selectivity, or ligand binding as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sánchez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). It has been further demonstrated that Y<sub>2</sub>R does not require the N terminus for ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lindner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>).

Importantly, recruitment of soluble His<sub>6</sub>-tagged GFP proteins as well as Y<sub>2</sub>Rs to 1 μm pre-structured spots led to analogous intensity profiles, reflecting that similar densities were obtained in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In contrast, cells expressing Y<sub>2</sub>Rs without the His<sub>6</sub>-tag (Y<sub>2</sub>R<sup>mEGFP</sup>) showed no receptor clustering after addition of <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1−figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating the specificity of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag/<italic>tris</italic>NTA interaction. Remarkably, ten minutes after receptor clustering by the multivalent nanotool, the Y<sub>2</sub>R enrichment resulted in an integrated receptor density equivalent to that of cells cultured on matrices functionalized with anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies. However, a 10-fold higher antibody concentration (1 μm final) was required compared to the multivalent nanotool, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Y<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1−figure supplement 3</xref>).

To characterize receptor clustering induced by the chelator nanotool, we first examined whether Y<sub>2</sub>R clustering affects lipid diffusion and distribution by labeling the membrane with the lipid-like dye CellMask. We observed a homogeneous staining of the plasma membrane, demonstrating that receptor confinement does not affect lipid distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2−figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine lateral diffusion coefficients <italic>(D),</italic> we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). <italic>In situ</italic> receptor clustering was triggered on Y<sub>2</sub>R-expressing cells cultured on SA-matrices by incubation with <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> (100 nM, +10 min), followed by membrane labeling with the lipid-like dye. In a subsequent step, square-shaped regions of interest (ROIs) covering four 1 μm-sized spots were photobleached. Fluorescence recovery was analyzed by a FRAP simulation approach that enabled calculation of diffusion coefficients independent of bleaching geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Blumenthal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). The lateral diffusion coefficient of lipids obtained by FRAP showed an average value of D<sub>lipid</sub> = 0.66 ± 0.10 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is in agreement with literature values for free Brownian lipid diffusion at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schwille <italic>et al.,</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wawrezinieck <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To evaluate the Y<sub>2</sub>R mobility in the ligand-free induced clusters, we determined the lateral diffusion of Y<sub>2</sub> receptor in cells cultured on SA-matrices before and after receptor clustering by <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> (100 nM, 10 min). A square-shaped ROI covering four 1 μm-sized spots was photobleached. A significant decrease in the lateral diffusion of the Y<sub>2</sub>R was observed at the basal membrane of cells after receptor confinement by <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> (<italic>D</italic><sub>before</sub> = 0.25 ± 0.08 μm<sup>2</sup>/s <italic>versus</italic> D<sub>after</sub> = 0.10 ± 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, E</xref>).

Notably, no significant difference in receptor mobile fraction <italic>(M<sub>f</sub>)</italic> before and after addition of the nanotool was observed (<italic>M<sub>f</sub></italic> = 0.80 ± 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In comparison, FRAP analyses of cells cultured on matrices functionalized with anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies presented a drastic decrease in receptor diffusion and mobile fraction at the clustered spots (<italic>M</italic><sub>f,anti-His6 Ab</sub> = 0.56 ± 0.08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2−figure supplement 3</xref>, Video 2). Despite the high affinity and kinetically stable binding (k<sub>off</sub> = 0.18 h<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gatterdam <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>), the His-tag/<italic>tris</italic>NTA system relies on molecular multivalency, which enables competition of binding sites with histidine or other receptors, thus making the process of receptor assembly reversible. We rationalized that free receptors diffuse into the clustered spots and exchange with photobleached receptors at multivalent binding sites, leading to a dynamic confinement. Our results indicate that a high proportion of receptors is exchanged in and out of micrometer-sized clusters, an effect that likely depends on cluster size, with larger clusters showing less recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sánchez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We also investigated the lateral receptor mobility with a higher spatiotemporal resolution using imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (imFCS).

The receptor diffusion coefficient measured before clustering was comparable to membrane proteins of similar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lippincott-Schwartz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>), demonstrating that the microstructured confinement does not affect receptor mobility.</p><p id="P13">In contrast to FRAP, imFCS provides a two-dimensional diffusion map, which enables the determination of local differences in the lateral diffusion coefficient of membrane receptors with high precision.

Taken together, we unravel that in microscale clusters, associations between His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Y<sub>2</sub>Rs and multivalent <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> resulted in a decreased lateral diffusion but dynamic receptor exchange with unchanged mobile fraction, which is similar to the behavior described for ligand-activated receptor clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chavez-Abiega <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ligand-independent receptor clustering triggers fast signaling</title><p id="P14">To mimic a scenario in which receptors can cluster at the mesoscale and still reflect physiologically relevant dimensions for clustering at cell-cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Guo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>), Y<sub>2</sub>R-expressing cells were cultured on microstructured matrices with a diameter of 1 μm, the smallest pattern we can produce and analyze with high accuracy. After addition of the multivalent nanotool, the receptor redistribution was tracked by CLSM at 37 °C. Receptor clustering occurred in the first minutes and increased within 10 min until an equilibrium was reached, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in receptor density compared to the initial state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, Video 3).

By ligand-free receptor clustering, the high local receptor density may increase the residence time of G proteins in vicinity and recruit further downstream effectors, which could boost the probability of activation and subsequent signaling. Based on the formation of the high affinity Y<sub>2</sub>/G protein complexes and the short time regime (1-5 min) in which changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and cell motility are observed, it is likely that the ligand-independent activation mechanism involves the G protein pathway. G protein signaling leads to the release of Gβγ and activation of phospholipase C-beta that cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub> opens intracellular calcium stores through PIP<sub>3</sub> receptors, leading to local activation of cytoskeletal proteins and causing the observed cell motility response.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ligand-free vs ligand-induced receptor activation differs in arrestin recruitment</title><p id="P18">We finally explored the impact of receptor clustering on downstream signaling by monitoring arrestin-3 recruitment.

Short-term desensitization occurs within minutes and is primarily associated with arrestin preventing G protein interaction with the GPCR.

To assess whether ligand-free clustering leads to Arr3 recruitment, we transfected cells stably expressing the Y<sub>2</sub>R with Arr3<sup>mCherry</sup> (in brief Arr3) and monitored Arr3 recruitment in real-time by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In agreement with our results shown above, image analysis at an equilibrium state (30 min after addition of the nanotool) showed a subsequent increase in Y<sub>2</sub>R density in the clustered regions upon addition of pNPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Surprisingly, upon microscale receptor confinement by <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup>, we did not observe a significant increase in Arr3 recruitment by intensity-contrast analysis of the patterned spots, whereas a significant Arr3 recruitment was detected upon addition of the agonist pNPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, D</xref>). Reversibility by specific competition with histidine showed that half of the intensity in the patterned regions was dissipated of the Y<sub>2</sub>R/Arr3 assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, D</xref>). These results suggest that not all receptors within the cluster regions are associated with the nanotool upon addition of the ligand, supporting the observation of increased receptor density in the presence of the pNPY. Patterning of Arr3 was also detected in cells on an anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody matrix within the first minutes after addition of pNPY (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6−figure supplement 1</xref>). In this case, we did not observe a significant change in receptor density upon addition of the pNPY, indicating that the high degree of immobilization and large size of the antibody might restrict the transient enrichment of active receptors into the clustered regions. Specific clusters termed GPCR hot spots (40-300 nm) have been visualized at the plasma membrane of living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Calebiro &amp; Jobin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chavez-Abiega <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hilger <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sungkaworn <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). These hot spots represent regions that preferentially engage signaling, and that are enriched in both receptors and G proteins. We hypothesize that the induced microscale clusters trigger the formation of hot spots, which provide an ideal environment for recruitment of more active receptors and thus amplification of the signal. By increasing the local effective receptor concentration, this organization may amplify both the speed and efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling while enabling local signal transduction. In summary, our results show a difference between Arr3 recruitment in the ligand-free mode compared to the ligand-activated state. These observations indirectly confirm a high-affinity interaction between the Y<sub>2</sub>R and Gα<sub>i</sub> and suggest active recruitment of G proteins that delay Arr3 recruitment and impair termination of G protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Ziffert <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Likewise, the increased recruitment of receptors observed after addition of the pNPY ligand may be directly related to the dynamic nature of the confined regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">We developed a versatile approach to cluster receptors <italic>in situ</italic> with minimal steric hindrance and disturbance. The transient association between the multivalent nanotool and the receptors revealed the generation of a dynamic platform for cell signaling. The dynamic exchange of molecules within induced Y<sub>2</sub>R microscale clusters may contribute to the formation of hot spots and final downstream signaling. This feature, as well as the broad applicability and the lower concentration required compared to established systems with immobilized ligands or antibodies, highlight the advantages of this versatile approach. Ligand-independent receptor activation by confinement was unraveled by cytosolic calcium increase and changes in cell spreading and motility, a response analogous to ligand-induced receptor activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated an amplification of the signal upon ligand-induced activation in cells pre-clustered with the nanotool. Subsequent addition of the neuropeptide ligand led to an enhancement of the calcium signal compared to ligand-induced activation without clustering. Interestingly, we demonstrated an increase in the receptor intensity in the clustered areas concomitant with ligand addition. We also uncovered a difference in downstream signaling for the ligand-free <italic>versus</italic> ligand-activated receptors as evidenced by co-recruitment of Arr3 to the clustered spots only occurring in the presence of the neuropeptide ligand.

We hypothesize that high-affinity Y<sub>2</sub>R/Gα<sub>i</sub> interactions drive the initial cell response, cytosolic calcium increase, and cell motility.

For the analysis, a simulation approach that allows computation of diffusion coefficients regardless of bleaching geometry used in the FRAP series was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Blumenthal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). The method is based on fitting a computer-simulated recovery to actual recovery data of a FRAP series. The algorithm accepts a multiple-frame TIFF file, representing the experiment as input, and simulates the diffusion of the fluorescent probes (<italic>2D</italic> random walk) starting with the first post-bleach frame of the actual data. Once the simulated recovery is finished, the algorithm fits the simulated data to the real one and extracts the diffusion coefficient. The algorithm iteratively creates a series of simulated images, where each frame corresponds to a single iteration. The intensity values are extracted from the (user indicated) bleached area of the simulated frames, thus determining the general shape of the recovery curve. The "time" axis at this stage is in arbitrary units (iterations). To extract the diffusion coefficient, the simulated recovery curve needs to be fitted to the real recovery curve, by appropriately stretching the "time" axis.

To generate frequency distribution plots, diffusion coefficients were log-transformed and binned in the interval between -5.3 and 1.0 with a bin size of 0.1 for each cell. Logarithmic diffusion coefficients were re-transformed, frequency counts were averaged over all cells per condition, and normalized. Frequency counts were plotted logarithmically against diffusion coefficients. Errors bars represent standard errors of the mean.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Arr3 recruitment upon receptor confinement</title><p id="P36">Microstructured surfaces were functionalized with biotin-BSA and SA or SA and anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody as described before. For transient co-transfection with Arr3<sup>mCherry</sup>, cells were sub-cultured the day before and then transfected with the Arr3<sup>mCherry</sup> plasmid using the TurboFect™ transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions and induced with Tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml) 18 h before microscopy. Cells co-expressing His<sub>6</sub>-Y<sub>2</sub>R<sup>mGFP</sup> and Arr3 were seeded onto the microstructured matrices and visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in LCIS at 37 °C after 3 to 4 h to ensure a homogeneous cell membrane adhesion, which is a prerequisite for quantitative TIRF microscopy. For antibody experiments, cells grown on pre-structured matrices were incubated with pNPY (10 nM, Tocris) in LCIS for 30 min at 37 °C. For <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> experiments, cells grown on SA-matrices were subsequently incubated with nickel-loaded <italic>tris</italic>NTA<sup>PEG12-B</sup> (100 nM final) and pNPY (10 nM final) in LCIS for 30 min at 37 °C. For reversibility, cells were incubated with histidine (5 mM) in LCIS for 30 min. Experiments were performed in biological replicas (N=2).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Arr3 imaging by TIRF microscopy</title><p id="P37">The detection system was set up on an epi-fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2). For selective fluorescence excitation of mGFP and mCherry, a multi-laser engine (Toptica Photonics, Munich, Germany) was used at 488 and 561 nm, respectively. The samples were illuminated in total internal reflection (TIR) configuration (Nikon Ti-LAPP) using a 60x oil immersion objective (NA = 1.49, APON 60XO TIRF). After appropriate filtering using standard filter sets, the fluorescence was imaged onto a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor, Northern Ireland). The samples were mounted on an x-y-stage (CMR-STG-MHIX2-motorized table, Märzhäuser, Germany), and scanning was supported by a laser-guided automated Perfect Focus System (Nikon PFS).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Contrast quantification and statistical analyses</title><p id="P38">Contrast analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lanzerstorfer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lanzerstorfer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schütz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Initial imaging recording was supported by the Nikon NIS Elements software. Images were exported as TIFF frames and fluorescence contrast analysis was performed using the Spotty framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Borgmann <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). The fluorescence contrast &lt;c&gt; was calculated as &lt;c&gt; = (F<sup>+</sup> - F<sup>-</sup>)/(F<sup>+</sup> - F<sub>bg</sub>), where F<sup>+</sup> denotes the intensity of the inner pixels of the pattern. F<sup>-</sup> shows the intensity of the surrounding pixels of the micropattern, and F<sub>bg</sub> the intensity of the global background. Data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Comparisons of more than two different groups were performed using one-way ANOVA, which was followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test in GraphPad Prism software (version 9.1.2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS144950-supplement-Supplemental_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAeEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christian Winter, Andrea Pott, Inga Nold, and all members of the Institute of Biochemistry (Goethe University Frankfurt) for discussion and comments.
