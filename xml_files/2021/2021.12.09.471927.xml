Inference of clonal composition from bulk sequencing has elucidated the breadth of ITH across tumor types and suggests that often rare pre-existing clones can resist therapy-induced killing to drive relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dentro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gerlinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Landau et al., 2013</xref>). However, such methods are limited by their inability to characterize such resistant clones beyond genotype and how their properties change over time and in response to therapy. Recently, several lineage tracing approaches have emerged that are able to link clonal identity with gene expression by utilizing expressed genetic barcodes that are read-out by single cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Biddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). These powerful methods allow deconvolution of complex mixtures of clones while simultaneously providing a gene expression profile of those cells that can indicate the pathways on which they depend. However, to date in solid tumors these technologies have mostly been used to study drug response <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oren et al., 2021</xref>) or metastatic dissemination <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yang et al., 2022</xref>) and have not been utilized to study therapeutic response in immune-competent models.</p><p id="P3">A thorough understanding of the biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy is essential if we are to improve patient outcomes. Most existing combination cancer therapies are not rationally designed but were instead empirically optimized to avoid overlapping toxicities. More recently alternative therapeutic strategies have emerged including synthetic lethality, drug synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Al-Lazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Neil et al., 2017</xref>) and collateral sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mueller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pluchino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) that aim to leverage selective vulnerabilities of tumor cells while minimizing toxicity. Of particular promise is collateral sensitivity, in which as a tumor becomes resistant to one drug it comes at the cost of sensitivity to a second drug. Since many modern clinical trials occur in the context of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, the identification of frontline therapy-induced collateral sensitivities to second line therapy would have the potential to be rapidly translated into improved outcomes for patients.</p><p id="P4">Here we develop WILD-seq <bold>(W</bold>holistic <bold>I</bold>nterrogation of <bold>L</bold>ineage <bold>D</bold>ynamics by <bold>seq</bold>uencing), an accessible and adaptable platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level that facilitates <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of clonal dynamics and apply it to the study of syngeneic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models. Our optimized pipeline ensures recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention. Importantly, analysis of response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. Building on the work of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">LeBoeuf et al., 2020</xref>) we show that these NRF2-high, taxane-resistant, lineages are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation with L-asparaginase and that they adapt to this second line intervention by up-regulating <italic>de novo</italic> asparagine synthesis through asparagine synthetase (Asns). Together these data indicate that high levels of NRF2 signaling, which is also observed in patients following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, promotes both resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity to asparagine deprivation and warrant the exploration of L-asparaginase as a therapeutic modality in solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of an expressed barcode system to simultaneously detect clonal lineage and gene expression</title><p id="P5">WILD-seq uses a lentiviral library to label cells with an expressed, heritable barcode that enables identification of clonal lineage in conjunction with single cell RNA sequencing. The WILD-seq construct comprises a zsGreen transcript which harbours in its 3’ untranslated region (UTR) a barcode consisting of two 12 nucleotide variable regions separated by a constant linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Each variable region is separated from any other sequence in the library by a Hamming distance of 5 to allow for library preparation and sequencing error correction and our library contains over 1.5 million unique barcodes. The barcode is appropriately positioned relative to the polyadenylation signal to ensure its capture and sequencing by standard oligo-dT single cell sequencing platforms.</p><p id="P6">The standard WILD-seq pipeline is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>. A heterogeneous cell line is transduced with a barcode library at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to ensure that each cell receives a maximum of one barcode. An appropriate size pool of barcoded clones is selected and stabilized in culture. Empirically, we have found a pool established from 750 individual clones works well to provide effective representation of the diversity within the cell lines used herein while also enabling recurrent representation of the same clones across animals and experiments. Once stabilized in culture, the pool of WILD-seq clones can be analyzed directly by single cell sequencing or injected into a recipient animal for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth. WILD-seq single cell sequencing libraries can be prepared using a standard oligo-dT based protocol and addition of an extra PCR amplification step can be used to increase coverage of the barcode region and aid cell lineage assignment.</p><p id="P7">We first established a WILD-seq clonal pool from the mouse 4T1 cell line, a triple negative mammary carcinoma model that can be orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of a BALB/c syngeneic host, which we have previously shown to be heterogeneous with distinct sub-clones having unique biological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wagenblast et al., 2015</xref>). We performed single cell sequencing of the <italic>in vitro</italic> WILD-seq pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumors derived from this clonal pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Over the course of our studies, we injected multiple cohorts of mice with our WILD-seq 4T1 pool as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, some of which were subjected to a specific drug regime. All tumors were harvested at humane endpoint, as determined by tumor volume unless otherwise stated and immediately dissociated for single cell sequencing.</p><p id="P8">For the purpose of characterising the baseline properties of our clones, we performed an in-depth transcriptomic analysis of all tumors from untreated and vehicle-treated animals. A WILD-seq barcode and thereby clonal lineage could be unambiguously assigned to 30-60% of cells per sample within the presumptive tumor cell/mammary epithelial cell cluster. 132 different WILD-seq barcodes were observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in total 94 different WILD-seq barcodes were observed across our <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor samples. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor samples comprised both tumor cells and host cells of the tumor microenvironment including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, enabling simultaneous profiling of the tumor and its microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Clustering was performed after removal of reads mapping to the WILD-seq vector, to avoid any influence of the WILD-seq transcript on clustering, and the WILD-seq barcode assignment subsequently overlaid onto these data. The tumor cell clusters were clearly identifiable by the high expression of the barcode transcript. Occasionally a barcode was observed in cells which clustered according to their transcriptome outside of the main tumor cluster. Since this could be the result of sequencing or technical error causing a mismatch between the WILD-seq barcode and the cell of origin, only barcoded cells that clustered within the main tumor/mammary epithelium cell cluster were included in our analysis.</p><p id="P9">We reproducibly observed the same clonal populations across animals and independent experiments which is critical to our ability to examine the effects of different interventions and treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>). The relative abundance of clones was similar in tumors grown in NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient and BALB/c immunocompetent mice but was drastically different to that found in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell pool from which they were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), suggesting that clones that show greatest fitness in cell culture do not necessarily show fitness <italic>in vivo.</italic> Therefore, <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> clonal lineage tracking experiments are likely to capture a different collection of clones and have the potential to identify sensitive or resistance clones that are not represented <italic>in vivo.</italic> Pseudo-bulk analysis of the major clonal lineages revealed that the composition of the tumor microenvironment has a dramatic effect on the transcriptome of the tumor cells for all clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Comparison of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, tumors from NSG mice, and tumors from BALB/c mice by principal component analysis (PCA), showed clear separation of the tumor cells depending on their environment, with differences in interferon gamma signaling, TNF-alpha signaling, and cell cycle being most prominent between cells grown <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (PC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Differences in gene expression between tumors growing in immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts were related to changes in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and changes in interferon gamma and Il-2 signaling, consistent with the differences in T-cell abundance (PC2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These data highlight the importance of the host immune system in sculpting the transcriptome and provide cautionary context for the analysis of tumor gene expression in immune-compromised hosts. Although there were large differences between clonal gene expression patterns across hosts the clones showed consistent differences in gene expression across all settings, reflective of intrinsic clonal properties, with the biggest variation in gene expression across the clones being related to their position along the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) axis (PC3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). In particular, Clone 679 is the most distinct and the most mesenchymal of the clones.</p><p id="P10">To further characterize the major clones in our tumors, we performed gene set expression analysis using AUCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) to identify pathways that are enriched in cells of a specific clonal lineage. Analysis was performed across four independent experiments each with three vehicle-treated animals and for the majority of clones we were able to identify distinct gene expression signatures that were reproducible across animals and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Simultaneous detection of changes in clonal abundance, gene expression, and tumor microenvironment in response to BET bromodomain inhibition with WILD-seq</title><p id="P11">Having established that we can repeatedly observe the same clonal lineages and their gene expression programs across animals and experiments, we next sought to perturb the system. We chose the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 for our proof-of-principle experiments to assess the ability of the WILD-seq system to simultaneously measure changes in clonal abundance, gene expression and the tumor microenvironment that occur following therapeutic intervention. JQ1 competitively binds to acetylated lysines, displacing BRD4 and thereby repressing transcription at specific loci. A large number of studies have indicated that BET inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors including breast cancer, possibly by inhibiting certain key proto-oncogenes such as MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">G. Jiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Treatment of our 4T1 WILD-seq tumor-bearing mice with JQ1 caused an initial suppression of tumor growth but with only a small overall effect on time to humane endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Tumors treated with JQ1 or vehicle alone were harvested at endpoint, dissociated and subjected to single cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Two independent experiments were performed, each with 3 mice per condition.</p><p id="P13">We first explored whether JQ1 had any effect on the tumor microenvironment. The most striking difference we observed was a change in abundance among the cells belonging to the T-cell compartment. To analyze this further, we computationally extracted these cells from the single cell data, reclustered them and performed differential abundance testing using Milo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Milo detects sets of cells that are differentially abundant between conditions by modeling counts of cells in neighborhoods of a KNN graph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dann et al., 2021</xref>). When applied to our reclustered T-cells, Milo identified a significant decrease in abundance in cytotoxic T-cells, as identified by their expression of Cd8a and Cd8b1, following JQ1 treatment. A significant change was observed in both of our experiments although the magnitude of the effect was greater in experiment A.</p><p id="P14">We next examined the effect of JQ1 treatment on the transcriptome of the tumor cells. Differential expression analysis was performed for each clonal lineage and experiment independently. As expected, given its mode of action, we identified significant down-regulation of a wide range of genes with consistent changes across clonal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table 6</xref>). Among the repressed genes, were a number of genes related to interferon (IFN) signaling and antigen processing and presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, 2e</xref>), including GBP2 which is strongly induced by IFN gamma, the MHC class II protein, Cd74, and B2m, a component of the MHC class I complex. JQ1 has previously been reported to directly inhibit transcription of IFN-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gibbons et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gusyatiner et al., 2021</xref>) suggesting this may be due to the direct action of JQ1 within our tumor cells, however JQ1-dependent changes to the tumor microenvironment may also influence these expression pathways.</p><p id="P15">Our barcoded 4T1 clones showed varied sensitivity to JQ1, with treatment causing reproducible changes to clonal proportions within the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In particular, one of the most abundant clones, clone 473, is highly sensitive to JQ1 treatment. In contrast, 3 clones were identified as being the most resistant to JQ1 treatment, clones 93, 439 and 264. These clones which together make up less than 5% of the tumor in vehicle treated mice constitute on average 12.8% of the JQ1-treated tumors. To examine baseline transcriptomic signatures of JQ1-sensitivity and resistance, we identified gene sets whose expression in vehicle-treated tumors was highly correlated with response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2h, 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Interestingly, interferon signaling which is significantly attenuated in our JQ1-treated tumors is highly correlated with sensitivity to JQ1, suggesting a possible higher dependence of the sensitive clones on these pathways. Conversely resistance is associated with higher levels of unfolded protein response and mTOR signaling consistent with a known role of mTOR-mediated autophagy in resistance to JQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Luan et al., 2019</xref>), and cytotoxic synergy between PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and BET inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stratikopoulos et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Clonal transcriptomic correlates of response and resistance to taxane chemotherapy in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma model</title><p id="P16">Our studies with JQ1 exemplify the ability of the WILD-seq system to simultaneously measure <italic>in vivo</italic> the effect of therapeutic intervention on clonal dynamics, gene expression and the tumor microenvironment. However, we were interested in using our system to investigate a chemotherapeutic agent currently in use in the clinic. We therefore treated our 4T1 WILD-seq tumor-bearing mice with docetaxel as a representative taxane, a class of drugs which are routinely used to treat triple negative breast cancer patients. As with JQ1, docetaxel treatment resulted in an initial, modest reduction in tumor growth followed by relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Comparison of vehicle and docetaxel (DTX) treated tumors revealed differential response of clonal lineages to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3b, 3c, 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) with clone 679 being the most resistant and clone 238 the most sensitive to chemotherapy.</p><p id="P17">Correlating the clones’ baseline transcriptomic profiles with response to docetaxel, revealed a major role for EMT in modulating sensitivity and resistance to taxane-based therapy. The 4T1 clones which are most sensitive to docetaxel are characterized by high expression of E-Cadherin regulated genes and low Zeb1 activity consistent with a more epithelial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3e, 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). These observations are in agreement with previous studies that have implicated EMT, and its associated endowment of cancer stem cell-like characteristics, as a mechanism of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies like docetaxel in cell culture and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bhola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Creighton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gupta et al., 2009</xref>). Resistance to docetaxel was correlated with up-regulation of multiple gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3e, 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). This included genes whose expression is elevated in non-responders to docetaxel in human breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Honma et al., 2008</xref>) demonstrating the relevance of findings arising from this approach. Interestingly, we also identify metabolic reprogramming as a potential mechanism of docetaxel resistance with higher expression of genes related to glycogen and glutathione metabolism being correlated with resistance to docetaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig, 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Clonal transcriptomic signatures of response and resistance to taxane chemotherapy in the D2A1 mammary carcinoma model</title><p id="P18">To explore the general applicability of WILD-seq to other models, we utilized a second triple negative mammary carcinoma model, D2A1-m2 (hereafter referred to as D2A1). Similar to the 4T1 cell line, this line was derived from a mouse mammary tumor in a BALB/c mouse and can be orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of immunocompetent, syngeneic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jungwirth et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We established a WILD-seq D2A1 clonal pool by transducing the D2A1 cell line with our WILD-seq barcode library. These barcoded cells were orthotopically implanted into a cohort of mice, half of which were treated with docetaxel, while the remaining animals received vehicle alone. Docetaxel treatment caused an initial reduction in tumor growth with subsequent relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We performed single cell RNA sequencing of three tumors per condition and assigned the tumor cells to a distinct clonal lineage based on the presence of the WILD-seq barcode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In total 103 different WILD-seq barcodes were observed <italic>in vivo</italic> with a dramatic shift in relative clonal abundance on docetaxel treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Unlike our 4T1 breast cancer model, variation between clonal lineages was no longer dominated by the EMT status of the clones and all clones exhibited a more mesenchymal-like phenotype consistent with the fact that this was a subline of D2A1 selected for its metastatic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This provides us with a distinct yet complementary system to investigate chemotherapy resistance with the potential to reveal alternative mechanisms than EMT status.</p><p id="P20">We identified 3 clones which were acutely sensitive to docetaxel, clones 118, 2874 and 1072. Together these constitute on average 37% of the vehicle-treated tumors but only 1.3% of the docetaxel-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). To understand the properties of these clones, we analyzed the baseline gene expression characteristics of clones in vehicle-treated tumors. The gene expression of cells from a clone of interest was compared to all tumor cells to which a WILD-seq barcode could be assigned from the same sample, and clonal signatures identified that were significantly enriched across animals. Specific gene expression signatures were identifiable for all clones analyzed, some of which were unique to a single clone while others overlapped across the sensitive clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). For example, clone 1072 shows elevated levels of expression of cell cycle related pathways, such as E2F-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>), indicating that aberrant cell cycle control in these cells that could increase their susceptibility to an antimitotic cancer drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), interestingly high levels of E2F-targets have recently been shown to be associated with response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sammut et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Three clones robustly increased their relative abundance within the tumor following docetaxel treatment, clones 1197, 751 and 1240, which despite making up less than 1% of the vehicle-treated tumors together constituted more than 20% of the docetaxel-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Due to the low abundance of cells in vehicle-treated samples, cells belonging to all 3 clones were pooled to analyse their baseline gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Among the gene sets differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive clones, were a number of breast cancer amplicons indicating that there may be specific copy number variations associated with these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4g, 4h</xref>). However single cell DNA sequencing data would be required to confirm the presence of specific genetic traits within our clones. Interestingly, gains in 8q24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Han et al., 2010</xref>), 20q11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Voutsadakis, 2021</xref>) and loss of 16q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Höglander et al., 2018</xref>) have previously been reported to be associated with resistance to taxane-based chemotherapy in agreement with our findings.

While informative, these studies cannot differentiate between changes in bulk gene expression that arise due to clonal selection and changes that are induced within a clonal lineage as the result of drug exposure. Even with single cell sequencing, definitive identification of the same clonal population across treatment conditions is impractical. Our method alleviates these difficulties by enabling the direct comparison of clones of the same lineage under different conditions.</p><p id="P23">To examine the relative contribution of clonal selection and transcriptional reprogramming to changes in gene expression upon chemotherapy, we compared analysis of gene expression within each clone individually to a combined analysis of all pooled tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Consistent with their mode of action, docetaxel had relatively little effect on the transcriptome of individual clones while JQ1 caused substantial changes to the transcriptome predominantly down-regulating gene expression. Genes were identified under all treatments that were altered within the tumor as a whole but as a result of clonal selection rather than intra-clonal changes in gene expression, with the biggest effects being observed with docetaxel treatment in D2A1 tumors, in agreement with this condition inducing the largest changes in relative clonal abundance. To confirm that changes in gene expression detected in bulk tumor analysis but not the clonal analysis could be attributed to differences in clonal sensitivity to chemotherapy, we analyzed baseline expression of these genes across the major clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). As expected, we found that genes up-regulated only in bulk tumor analysis had significantly higher expression in clones resistant to chemotherapy (that increase in abundance with treatment) and genes only down-regulated in bulk tumor analysis had significantly lower expression in these resistant clonal lineages.</p><p id="P24">Among the genes that change in expression within the tumor as a whole as a result of clonal selection upon docetaxel treatment, we identified a number of genes related to glutathione synthesis and conjugation including Mgst2, Esd and Gclm, that may endow resistant clones with greater ability to resolve reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by docetaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexandre et al., 2007</xref>). Of note, we also observed that in 4T1 tumors, Epcam was significantly reduced in expression in the bulk tumor but was not changed within the individual clonal populations. This suggests that rather than inducing an EMT within the tumor cells, docetaxel is selecting clones of a pre-existing more mesenchymal phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Convergent WILD-seq analysis across models identifies redox defense as a mediator of taxane resistance and amino asparagine deprivation as a means to target resistant clones</title><p id="P25">To examine if there were any shared mechanisms of taxane resistance across our 4T1 and D2A1 WILD-seq clones, we looked for genes that were enriched in resistant clonal lineages in both models. We identified 47 overlapping resistance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). These genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to resolution of oxidative stress including the NRF2 pathway and glutathione-mediated detoxification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Importantly, these genes were also enriched in human patients following combined anthracycline and taxane-based therapy, highlighting the potential clinical significance of our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

Expression of both these gene sets was significantly increased after chemotherapy, which our data would suggest is the result of outgrowth of resistant clonal lineages with increased propensity to withstand taxane-induced oxidative stress.</p><p id="P27">Given these findings, we hypothesized that combining taxane-based chemotherapy with a drug specifically targeting resistant clones with high Nrf2 signaling would provide a highly effective treatment regime. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged the finding that tumors with constitutively active Nrf2, due to mutation in the negative regulator Keap1, have metabolic vulnerabilities that arise from their high antioxidant production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Romero et al., 2017</xref>), including dependency of glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Romero et al., 2017</xref>) and a general dependency on exogenous non-essential amino acids (NEAA) including asparagine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">LeBoeuf et al., 2020</xref>). This metabolic dependency can be targeted therapeutically by L-asparaginase (ASNase from <italic>E.coli),</italic> which is used in the clinical management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<italic>ALL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Batool et al., 2016</xref>), and catalyzes the conversion asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P28">To ascertain whether docetaxel resistant clones were collaterally sensitive to ASNase, we treated D2A1 WILD-seq tumors initially with docetaxel to select for resistant clones and then began daily treatment with L-asparaginase one week later. This dosing regime was chosen as we found that with the dose of docetaxel used in this study co-administration of the 2 drugs or treatment with ASNase immediately following docetaxel was poorly tolerated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>, treatment with ASNase arrested tumor growth and led to a ~40% increase in time to endpoint (relative to vehicle) in this highly aggressive model, although the tumors did acquire resistance and regrew after approximately one week of treatment. Importantly, ASNase alone had no significant effect on tumor growth, indicative of a docetaxel-induced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). To determine the response of individual clonal lineages to ASNase treatment, we performed single cell sequencing on vehicle treated tumors (day 21), as well as docetaxel treated tumors before the start of ASNase treatment (day 21) and after 4 doses of ASNase (day 25). As before, our docetaxel-resistant clones, 751, 1197 and 1240, which have high levels of Nrf2 signaling all exhibited a dramatic increase in their abundance with docetaxel treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). Excitingly, clones 751 and 1197 were sensitive to ASNase returning to baseline levels. Clone 1240 decreased in abundance in 2 of the 3 mice analyzed so is likely to also be sensitive to ASNase but more data is required to confirm its response. As predicted, our Nrf2-high resistant clones were selectively targeted by amino acid deprivation as other clones such as 2323 were unchanged in their relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To confirm the mechanism of action of L-asparaginase and identify potential mechanisms of resistance to this drug that might cause the relapse observed, we analyzed the transcriptomic effects of ASNase administration. Genes which consistently changed in expression after ASNase treatment across clonal lineages are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6h</xref>. Many of the genes found to be differentially expressed in our tumor cells following L-asparaginase treatment are either directly related to protein synthesis (Eif3c, Gars, Eif3g, Eif5a) or are consistent with changes in gene expression reported in cell lines following amino acid deprivation including Atf5, Atf3, Jun, Fos, Egr1 and Asns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Pan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Pohjanpelto &amp; Hölttä, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Shan et al., 2010</xref>). Of specific interest is the up-regulation of asparagine synthetase (Asns) which catalyzes the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of L-asparagine from L-aspartate. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<italic>ALL</italic>), low levels of ASNS resulting in a dependence on extra-cellular asparagine are considered an important biomarker for L-asparaginase treatment. Moreover, the importance of ASNS overexpression in conferring asparaginase resistance has been well documented and is frequently seen in <italic>ALL</italic> patients that develop drug-resistant forms of the disease following treatment with ASNase (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Richards &amp; Kilberg, 2006</xref>)). In our experiments, this adaptation to asparaginase is observed across all clones analyzed suggesting a general resistance mechanism and supporting the clinical utility of an Asns inhibitor, if one were to be developed, as third line treatment in this context.</p><p id="P30">In summary, these data support the notion that WILD-seq can identify causal mechanisms of drug resistance <italic>in vivo,</italic> that can be leveraged to inform new combination therapies. Since the redox defense signatures we identified are detectable in patients after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), one can envisage an approach whereby patients receiving NAC have the surgical tumor specimen profiled for NRF2 gene signatures and those with high levels receive a post-operative course of L-asparaginase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Tumor heterogeneity is thought to underlie drug resistance through the selection of clonal lineages that can preferentially survive therapy. However, identifying the features of such lineages, so that they can be targeted therapeutically, has been challenging due the lack of understanding of their molecular characteristics and the lack of animal models to prospectively test therapeutic interventions and combinations thereof. To overcome these challenges, we utilized WILD-seq, a system that leverages expressed barcodes, population bottle necking, syngeneic mouse models and single cell RNA-seq to link clonal lineage to the transcriptome. Among the existing methods for coupling lineage tracing with single cell transcriptomic profiling, the majority use either lentiviral delivery of a genetic barcode similar to that used here or CRISPR/Cas9-mediate mutations for clonal lineage identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Biddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>). We chose to avoid CRISPR/Cas9-based lineage labeling as induction of DNA damage could have an impact on the transcriptome and the sensitivity of the cells to therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">L. Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Our approach is unique in that we purposefully bottleneck our clonal population to achieve a balance between maximizing clonal diversity and minimizing variation in clonal representation across replicate animals and experiments. It is this feature that allows us to robustly call clonal gene expression signatures and differential clonal abundance before and after therapeutic intervention and it is this in turn that allows us to identify relevant drug resistance mechanisms <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p id="P32">We find that the abundance of clones in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> differ greatly, with the most abundant clones <italic>in vitro</italic> being lowly represented <italic>in vivo</italic> and vice versa thus providing a cautionary note when analyzing drug response <italic>in vitro.</italic> Moreover, WILD-seq of 4T1 tumors revealed that the relative immune competence of the host profoundly sculpts the transcriptome of clonal lineages and, as exemplified by JQ1, therapeutic interventions can impact the tumor microenvironment and its interaction with tumor cells, effects that would be missed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in immunocompromised hosts. We utilized WILD-seq to analyze sensitivity and resistance to taxane chemotherapy in two syngeneic, triple negative, mammary carcinoma models highlighting both known and new pathways of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Marine et al., 2020</xref>). Resistance to cancer therapies can arise due to clonal selection or through adaptive reprograming of the epigenome and transcriptome of individual clones. Our data with docetaxel treatment in 4T1 and D2A1 indicate that over the time frames we have examined clonal selection is the dominant force driving resistance to chemotherapy with gene expression signatures, such as EMT and Nrf2 signaling, being present in clones at baseline that are then selected for during therapy. However, depending on the mode of action of specific drugs, transcriptional reprogramming may also induce therapeutic resistance and such mechanisms can also be effectively identified with the WILD-seq platform. Indeed, up-regulation of Asns, detected across clonal lineages after L-asparaginase provides an example of <italic>de</italic> <italic>novo</italic> acquisition of a resistance phenotype.</p><p id="P33">Applying WILD-seq to examine docetaxel response across two TNBC models afforded the opportunity to overlap resistance genes for the same drug across models and remove model-specific effects. These analyses uncovered a critical role for redox defense in docetaxel resistance that also appears to be operative in human breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. Having identified a primary cause of resistance, we next sought to explore the possibility of collateral sensitivity. Collateral sensitivity, first described for antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Imamovic &amp; Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pluchino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Roemhild &amp; Andersson, 2021</xref>) is the phenomenon by which resistance to one drug comes at the cost of sensitivity to a second drug. In the context of cancer and taxanes, collateral sensitivity has the distinct advantage over other therapeutic strategies of maintaining the initial first line therapy and only modifying subsequent therapies. We took advantage of previous findings linking constitutive Nrf2 signaling, via Keap1 loss, to a dependency on exogenous non-essential amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">LeBoeuf et al., 2020</xref>) and thereby sensitivity to L-asparaginase. Application of L-asparaginase led to an initial cessation of tumor growth followed by regrowth 6 days later. WILD-seq of docetaxel treated tumors before and after L-asparaginase treatment confirmed the specific suppression of Nrf2 high clones and also revealed a compensatory, clone agnostic, up-regulation of asparagine synthetase (Asns), which likely drives relapse in these tumors given the importance of ASNS to L-asparaginase resistance in <italic>ALL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Richards &amp; Kilberg, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we have previously shown that asparagine bioavailability regulates EMT and metastatic progression in breast cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knott et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, asparagine deprivation, which has not been extensively explored in breast cancer, may present multiple benefits to patients and the utility of L-asparaginase, a clinical stage drug, in this setting warrants further investigation.</p><p id="P34">This study highlights the challenges of tackling tumor heterogeneity therapeutically. Even though we can effectively suppress the induction of docetaxel resistant clones by administration of L-asparaginase the tumors still adapt to this intervention and regrow, most likely due to transcriptionally shifting their metabolism towards <italic>de novo</italic> asparagine synthesis. Nevertheless, hope still remains since there are only three avenues by which cells can supply themselves with asparagine (1) uptake of extra-cellular asparagine which is effectively shut-off by ASNase (2) <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis through Asns or (3) catabolism of existing proteins. If we could effectively force tumors to depend on synthesis through Asns, we could then deprive them of that additional dependency if Asns-directed therapeutics were to be developed. This concept of steering clonal evolution with drugs towards a predictable and irreconcilable, therapeutically targetable, dependency may provide a general approach to achieving durable therapeutic responses for which tractable models of tumor evolution, such as those described here, are essential predictive components.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p id="P35">The mouse mammary tumor cell lines 4T1 (ATCC) and D2A1-m2 (kind gifted from Clare Isacke’s lab) and the 293FT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) packaging cell line for virus production were cultivated in DMEM high glucose (Gibco), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Virus production</title><p id="P36">The WILD-seq library was packaged using 293FT lentivirus packaging cells.

A WILD-seq clonal barcode was assigned to a cell if there were at least 2 independent reads which matched the barcode to the cell and more than 50% of barcode mapped reads from the cell supported the assignment.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Extraction of WILD-seq barcodes from PCR enrichment data</title><p id="P51">Reads from the PCR barcode enrichment were processed separately using the UMI-tools to extract 10X cell barcodes and UMIs from the raw read files. The sequence corresponding to the full barcode sequence (20nt constant linker with a 12 nt variable region on either side) was extracted from each read and then mapped to the WILD-seq clonal barcode whitelist using Bowtie. A WILD-seq clonal barcode was assigned to a cell if there were at least 10 UMIs which matched the barcode to the cell and at least twice as many UMIs supporting this assignment compared to the next best.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>WILD-seq barcode assignment</title><p id="P52">The WILD-seq clonal barcode assignment from these 2 pipelines was then compared. If the assignment from the transcriptomic analysis and the PCR enrichment analysis were in agreement the barcode was assigned. On the rare occasion the assignment didn’t match a clonal barcode was not assigned. If a cell was assigned a WILD-seq barcode by only one method, a further more stringent filtering step was included. For WILD-seq barcodes assigned only from the 10X scRNA-seq dataset but not the PCR-enrichment, the minimum number of UMIs required to support the assignment was increased to 5 and for WILD-seq barcodes assigned only from the PCR-enrichment but not the 10X scRNA-seq dataset, the minimum number of UMIs required to support the assignment was increased to 30.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Differential gene expression</title><p id="P53">Differential gene expression was determined using the FindMarkers function in Seurat with a Wilcoxon rank sum test to identify differentially expressed genes. For differential expression of groups of genes, we used the AUCell R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) which enables analysis of the relative expression of a gene set (i.e. gene signature or pathway) across all the cells in single-cell RNA-seq data using the "Area Under the Curve" (AUC) to calculate the enrichment of the input geneset within the expressed genes for each cell. An AUCell score was calculated for each tumor cell for every gene set in the MSigDB C2 collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) that contained more than 20 genes with detectable expression in our data. AUCell scores were compared across clones or conditions using a Wilcoxon rank sum test and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparison using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method.</p><p id="P54">To generate baseline transcriptomic signatures for each clone in vehicle-treated tumors, comparisons were made between the clone of interest and all assigned tumor cells from the same sample (in the case of D2A1 tumors) or the same experiment (in the case of 4T1 tumors). Samples/experiments were included if they contained at least 20 cells assigned to the clone of interest. To define consistently enriched/depleted signatures, p-values from comparisons within each sample/experiment were combined using the Fisher’s method.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Patient data analysis</title><p id="P55">Microarray gene expression data was downloaded from GSE28844 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Vera-Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>). A single probe for each gene was selected based on the highest median expression. Gene set expression per patient sample was calculated using GSVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hänzelmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"

Lentiviral construct design.</bold> A PGK promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding zsGreen harboring a WILD-seq barcode sequence in the 3’UTR. A spacer sequence and polyadenylation signal ensure that that the barcode is detectable as part of a standard oligo dT single cell RNA library preparation and sequencing pipeline. The barcode cassette comprises 2 distinct 12 nucleotide barcode sequences separated by a constant 20 nucleotide linker region. The library of barcode sequences was designed with Hamming distance 5 to allow for sequencing error correction. <bold>b. Schematic of WILD-seq method.</bold> Tumor cells are infected with the WILD-seq lentiviral library and an appropriate size population of zsGreen positive cells isolated, each of which will express a single unique WILD-seq barcode. This WILD-seq barcoded, heterogenous cell pool is then subjected to an intervention of interest (such as <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of the implanted pool with a therapeutic agent) and subsequently analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing using the 10X Genomics platform. An additional PCR amplification step is included that specifically enriches for the barcode sequence to increase the number of cells to which a WILD-seq barcode can be conclusively assigned. <bold>c. scRNA-seq of</bold> <italic>in vitro</italic> <bold>4T1 WILD-seq cell pool.</bold> UMAP plot of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured 4T1 WILD-seq cells.

Comparison of differential gene expression analysis in bulk tumor cells and intra-clonal changes in gene expression.</bold> Differential gene expression was performed for all barcoded tumor cells irrespective of clonal lineage comparing chemotherapy-treated and vehicle-treated cells (bulk tumor cell analysis). Alternatively differential gene expression was performed for each individual clone separately and the results combined to identify genes which robustly undergo intra-clonal changes in expression (analysis by clone). Whereas bulk tumor cell analysis will identify changes in overall gene expression due to both changes in clonal abundance and changes within the cells, analysis by clone enables us to delineate exclusively induced cellular changes in gene expression. Log<sub>2</sub> fold change in expression as determined by each of these analysis methods is plotted. Genes with significant changes in expression with chemotherapy (p-value &lt; 0.05, logFC &lt; -0.2 or &gt; 0.2) are highlighted based on the method under which they were identified. Genes identified as significantly changing by one method only met neither logFC nor p-value cutoffs in the alternative method. <bold>b. Changes in gene expression that are identified by bulk tumor cell analysis only can attributed to changes in clonal abundance.</bold> The expression of genes which were identified as differential expressed after chemotherapy only in the bulk tumor cell analysis was assessed across clonal lineages at baseline. Baseline gene enrichment for each clone was determined as described previously by comparing cells of a specific clonal lineage to all barcoded tumor cells within the same vehicle-treated sample or experiment. Gene enrichment values for all genes with differential expression only in the bulk tumor cell analysis were plotted. As expected, genes down-regulated in bulk analysis have lower expression in resistant clones, whereas genes up-regulated in bulk analysis are enriched in resistant clones. p-values represent a one sample t-test vs a theoretical mean of 0.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS145925-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Taxane-resistant clones have elevated NRF2 signaling and are sensitive to asparagine deprivation.</title><p><bold>a.
