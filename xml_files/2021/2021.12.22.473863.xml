Theta sequences are rapid sweeps of spikes from multiple cells, tracing trajectories from past to future. Phase precession is the correlation between a place cell’s theta firing phase and animal position. Here we present an analysis of the strongly variable character of these features in CA1. We identify a cell group that do not phase precess but reliably express theta sequences. The cells that do phase precess only do so when the medium gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz, linked to Entorhinal inputs) dominates but then they show less theta sequences. The same cells express more sequences but not precession when slow gamma (20-45 Hz, linked to CA3 inputs) dominates. Moreover, sequences occur independently in the two groups. Our results challenge a causal relationship between precession and sequences and highlights the highly heterogeneous character of the hippocampal output.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">According to current theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the hippocampus combines heterogeneous information from both memory and the outside world to generate representations of episodes and complex occurrences, with space and time as the main organizing principles. Within the hippocampus, the CA1 subfield sits at the confluence of two information streams: the first, directly arising from Layer III pyramidal cells in the Entorhinal Cortex (EC3), carries signals about the animal’s position in space, and highly processed sensory information about landmarks and other relevant environmental features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The second, arising from the Schaffer collaterals coming from the CA3 subfield, is thought to mostly reflect activity shaped by the recurrent connectivity in that area, conducive to memory retrieval and sequence generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. In CA1, these two streams come in contact with each other, providing a neural mechanism that may enable the comparation of memories with incoming external information, and their potential updating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P4">To subserve such a complex function to the rest of the brain, the hippocampus likely makes use of temporal codes. The activity of hippocampal neural ensembles is organized in sequences that can be replayed during short pauses in behavior or sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Neuronal sequences also emerge at a compressed timescale in individual cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm, mirroring the order of activation at the behavioral timescale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Since the timescale at which theta sequences occur is compatible with spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], they have been deemed the main mechanism for storing spatial and non-spatial episodic memory traces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Theta phase precession, the systematic backing up in the firing phase of place cells with respect to theta, as the animal advances in the place field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], has been seen as a key organizing principle for hippocampal temporal codes. While the mechanisms giving rise to phase precession are still widely debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], two functional roles have been generally assumed for it. First, phase precession would induce a phase coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], that is, the theta firing phase of place cells would be a key conduit for information about the animal’s location. Second, phase precession would be the main ‘engine’ behind sequence formation: under certain assumptions, the presence of phase precession implies theta sequences, that is, a millisecond-scale temporal ordering between the firing of place cells with neighboring place fields, favoring spike-timing dependent plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. While theta is most evident in rodent, similar mechanisms may exist also in species where no theta oscillations are observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Both of these functional roles, however, depend on phase precession and theta sequences taking place in a reliable, nearly noise-free fashion, coherently across neurons, and would break down under high variance conditions. Yet, while we know that phase precession patterns change on a lap-by-lap basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], and that theta sequences and phase precession not always co-exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], a full picture of how hippocampal temporal coding varies under the influence of the network state is not available. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the variability of temporal coding in mouse CA1 place cells. We observe that from being a stable property of all place cells, phase precession varied in degree from neuron to neuron. While some cells showed full-blown phase precession pattern, others were phase-locked to the theta rhythm in a place-independent manner. Furthermore, each neuron could change its phase precessing pattern from one spatial location to the next. On a moment-by-moment basis, “phase-precessing” and “phase-locking” neurons appeared to form distinct functional networks, as they independently express theta sequences in different theta cycles.</p><p id="P7">The emerging picture suggests that temporal coding depends on which network state and which constellation of inputs each neuron is subject to at any given time. We characterize the CA1 network state by a precise, layer-resolved determination of the instantaneous balance of activity of the medium and slow gamma circuits, which changes from one theta cycle to the next. This is also a proxy for the instantaneous balance of CA1 inputs: inputs from Entorhinal Cortex LIII and CA3 to CA1 respectively are linked, with the emergence medium gamma (60-90 Hz) oscillations in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm), whereas the CA3 contribution is associated with slow gamma oscillations (20-45 Hz) in the stratum radiatum (sr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Medium gamma has been previously associated with stronger phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and slow gamma to more precise theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Here, we show that indeed these two coding schemes are dissociated, and the inputs favoring phase precession are detrimental for theta sequences.</p><p id="P8">Our results highlight the strong heterogeneity of hippocampal temporal codes, which should be taken into account by any theory of hippocampal function, including those linking phase precession and theta sequence and those assuming that CA1 is generating a unitary and coherent representation through time. The outcoming picture points to a multiplicity of mechanisms and coding schemes being “dynamically multiplexed” in CA1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The Hybrid Drive enables large scale place cell recordings with layer-resolved oscillations in freely moving mice</title><p id="P9">We implanted 6 mice with the Hybrid Drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]), a novel recording device that combines linear silicon probes with high density tetrode arrays. Tetrodes were individually lowered to target pyramidal cell bodies in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and enabled us to collect large ensemble activity of pyramidal neurons (up to ≈ 100) for up to 10 days.

While mice were never food or water deprived, we nevertheless observed that performance quickly increased in the first few days and then improved steadily, as measured by the number of laps completed on each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). For analysis, we considered data from the two running directions separately, by dividing left-to-right from right-to-left runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, violet and light blue, respectively). Among pyramidal neurons we selected those with significant spatial modulation (see Place Cell Identification). These place cells exhibited place fields that tiled the whole linear track in both running directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). To investigate properties of stable, well-learned hippocampal spatial representations, we focused on the data obtained from the later recording sessions (between day 7 and 10 of training), which also were the most consistent in terms of number of laps and velocity profiles.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Fine-scale temporal organization of place cell activity within theta rhythm</title><p id="P12">Theta oscillations shape the temporal organization of the firing of hippocampal neurons in many ways. There are two simplest models that may account for variability in the data: first, each neuron will fire preferentially around a certain theta phase, i.e. it is phase locked. Second, place cells will display a phase precession pattern as discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found high degrees of variability for these two properties across cells and even, for the same cell, depending on the animal location on the track. Thus, cells showed varying degrees of phase locking and phase precession, and these properties are place dependent.</p><p id="P13">To fully characterize this variability, for each cell we computed a Theta Score, defined as the difference between circular-linear correlation between theta phase of firing and animal location (a common measure for phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]) and Rayleigh Vector length (estimate for phase locking). This Theta Score places each place cell on a spectrum and enables us to study how phase locking and precession properties are distributed in populations of place cells. We consistently observed Theta Scores to have an unimodal, Gaussian-like distribution across place cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cells at the two ends of the interval presented good approximation of either perfect phase locking or phase precession, but most of the population could be described as a mixture of varying degree of the two modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Theta-score appeared to be largely independent of other properties of place cells: only a very weak correlation was found with the cell Skaggs information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; Spearman’s rho = 0.096; p &lt; 0.01), while no correlation was found with maximum firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; Spearman’s rho = - 0.001; p &gt; 0.05), place field size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>; Spearman’s rho = - 0.017; p &gt; 0.05) and place field activity baricenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>; Spearman’s rho = 0.027; p &gt; 0.05). Next, we investigated how the locking/precessing properties of a cell vary on the track and how they interact with the mean firing rate at a given location, to provide a picture of the interplay between place cells’ phase and rate coding ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]). As a location dependent measure of phase precession and locking, we took the spatial derivative of the cell’s preferred firing theta phase along the track (DeltaPhi). As many cells displayed multiple place fields along the track (here, we consider runs in the two running directions separately), by comparing Delta Phi and the location-based average firing rate (FR) we can evaluate the degree of phase precession on a field-by-field basis. In this framework, “phase precessing” fields are described by consistently negative values of DeltaPhi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, top row), whereas “phase locking” place fields display near zero (or positive) DeltaPhi (bottom row examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly to the Theta Score, each cell activity relationship with the phase of theta can be summarized by computing the correlation along the track between the cell firing rate and the associated DeltaPhi (phase precessing cells being expected to have an inverse relationship between firing rate increases and negative deflection of the preferred phase of spikes). This measure and the Theta Score are highly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>; Spearman’s rho = -0.175; p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Place cells phase coding properties vary across fields</title><p id="P14">Phase coding modalities are not an intrinsic property of place cells, but rather have a high spatial dependence. In fact, when comparing multiple place fields from the same cell, we found that their phase coding profiles were largely independent from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The probability to precess of field one (defined as the field with the highest peak firing rate; see Place Cell Identification) was only weakly (albeit significantly) correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.154 ; p &lt; 0.05) to the probability to precess of the secondary field of the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref> for spike sorting information for the example neurons). Examples from single-cells reveal how the DeltaPhi measure of field one reflects a phase precessing pattern, while the spikes of the secondary field exhibit a non-precessing relationship, and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, such phase coding granularity was even more strongly expressed when we considered place cells having place fields in both running directions of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The tendency to precess of a field in one running direction was found to be statistically independent from the phase relationship of the field in the other direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>; Spearman’s rho = 0.092; p &gt; 0.05). The propensity of single fields to precess can be thus conceived as a map-specific property, not unlike the peak firing rate and place field size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Current source density analysis reveal layer specific theta-gamma interaction in dorsal CA1</title><p id="P15">After characterizing the spatial modulation of phase precession within CA1 place fields, we sought to explore temporal modulation to phase precession by disentangling the contributions of different input streams in the CA1 circuit, their local integration. In order to obtain a clear picture of the interactions of theta and gamma oscillations in the network we applied Current Source Density analysis (CSD), a standard tool to estimate the contribution of local circuits to the LFP signal and enables precise layer-level resolution (which, in the hippocampal CA1 circuit relates neatly to different afferent pathways and groups of cells). For each CSD-time series we then computed the phase-amplitude relationship between the theta oscillation (6-10 Hz) and the power of oscillations at higher frequencies (15-250 Hz). Since theta power is maximal in the deeper portions of CA1 and theta oscillation presents a high degree of coherence across layers, we decided to use the signal from the slm probe contact as the reference theta oscillation signal. This signal was then used to produce a depth-specific profile of frequency-resolved gamma-theta couplings. Note that slm theta is 180 degrees shifted from pyramidal layer theta, used as a reference in some studies.</p><p id="P16">Following Lasztóczi and Klausberger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] we characterized gamma oscillations in a tridimensional ’gamma space’ with anatomical depth, frequency, and preferred theta phase as dimensions. Significant components in this space were then defined as contiguous regions of above-mean correlation strength. Once points in gamma space with significant coupling values found at different depths were concatenated, we obtained a 3-dimensional structure that represents theta-gamma interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then isolated individual volumes of significant coupling with consistent spatial extension and termed them ’Basins’. These Basins provide a data-driven definition of independent gamma oscillators in the CA1 circuit. We found 3 of these Basins, coinciding with 3 separate ranges of gamma: 20-45Hz, 60-90Hz and 100-150Hz. In the following they are identified as low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and fast gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), respectively. Each component can be characterized by its distinctive depth profile, most evident in the location of maximal coupling with theta phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). While slow gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) showed minimal variability along the CA1 depth profile, with a mostly constant theta coupling strength across CA1 layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), we could observe a gradual shift in the preferred coupling theta phase from more superficial layers (pyramidal) to deeper ones (slm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). On the contrary, the medium gamma component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) displayed a spatially localized pattern, with coupling strength peaking in the slm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Different from slow gamma, medium gamma theta phase preference shifts abruptly between the pyramidal layer and the stratum radiatum, and stays constant in the deeper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Finally, the fast gamma component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) emerges only in proximity of the pyramidal layer, maintaining a constant phase preference value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Based on this detailed description and visualization of gamma generators provided by the Basins, we then set out to disentangle the contributions of these circuit elements to the spike timing of place fields and place cell ensembles.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Phase precession arises in a subset of place fields when medium gamma dominates the CA1 network state</title><p id="P18">Because place fields do not appear to have consistent phase coding properties, we speculated that their temporal coding modalities may be affected by variability in the inputs to CA1, reflecting changing environmental conditions. We therefore investigated how the cycle-by-cycle balance of different gamma regimes, considered proxies for the influence of those different input sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], control the organization of the phase precession pattern within individual place fields. We used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to describe the spike probability of each place field given i) the position within the place field; ii) the instantaneous theta phase and iii) the instantaneous power in a specific gamma range and layer (as they were obtained from the previous Basins analysis). Depending on the Theta Score values of field one (described as the field with the highest peak firing rate; see Place Cell Identification), we divided the place field population in three equally distributed groups. Intermediate fields occupy the center of the Theta Score distribution, while phase precessing and phase locking the extremes. Crucially, we found that fields within the phase precessing population, were not performing phase precession in every theta cycle, but rather that phase precession could be seen to gradually appear in association with the increasing presence of medium gamma in the theta cycle. The spike density plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> reveals how the phase precession pattern gradually emerges as medium gamma becomes more dominant in the CA1 network state. The contour plots of the spike density distributions show how the appearance of spikes in the early portion of the theta cycle is conditioned to the increase of medium gamma power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, changes in gamma balance do not affect the spike distributions of the phase locking and intermediate population. This is replicated for each animal separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Importantly a further analysis using velocity as an additional factor in the GLM, shows that the observed gamma modulation of the phenomenon of phase precession is independent of changes in the running speed of the animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Long dendritic depolarizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] may induce bursts of spikes in CA1 pyramidal cells, and it is therefore interesting to explore whether bursting dynamics differs between precessing and non-precessing fields. We considered separately spikes that where either emitted in bursts or in isolation (ISI&gt;7ms; see Single Spikes and Burst Spikes classification) and we found a significant modulation of burst propensity by Theta Score, with phase precessing fields having on average an higher burst fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; p&lt;0.05, two-sample t-test).</p><p id="P20">Contour of regions of highest density of spikes further reveal how the population of phase precessing fields is more affected by the instantaneous balance of gamma oscillations; while the population of phase locking fields tends not to vary the in-field/phase organization of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>; Kolmogorov-Smirnov on spike densities, all animals (N=6), all sessions (n=12)). Moreover, for phase precessing cells the higher amount of burst events was not evenly distributed over the theta cycle. During medium gamma dominated cycles they appeared to concentrate at the earliest phases of the cycle, ahead of the phase interval containing most single spikes; while during slow gamma dominated cycles the phase preference of burst spikes was more evenly distributed along the phases of the ongoing theta cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>; significant Rayleigh Vector Length Difference against shuffling, T-test: p&lt;0.01).</p><p id="P21">When looking at single field cases (phase-position slopes of individual fields), the effect is still present. With increasing dominance of medium gamma, fields with a higher Theta Score tend to acquire a steeper phase-position slope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). This medium gamma related effect is only visible for fields with higher Theta Score, while slow gamma does not modulate the phase-position slope and the Theta Score. Once again this is replicated for each animal separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that phase precession selectively arises in a subset of place fields, as a function of the oscillatory state of the CA1 network.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Organization of theta sequences during slow and medium gamma network states</title><p id="P22">Until now, we have been looking at phase coding, a potential way for single receptive fields (place fields), to convey spatial information in addition to what is already contained in the firing rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Yet, a key role that theoretical models ascribed to phase precession is the shaping of the activity of one place field with neighbouring fields into temporal sequences spanning one theta cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Because we observed an effect of gamma oscillations on phase precession, we therefore asked whether such theta sequences were likewise affected by changes in medium and slow gamma power. We first addressed pairwise co-activation patterns, a basic, but sensitive index of sequential activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], we measured the correlation between the distance between the place fields of a place cell pair and the average theta phase difference of their first spikes in each theta cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This correlation measure reflects how much a spatial distance could be reliably inferred from a temporal one. We repeated this procedure by further separating spikes according to the gamma dominating the theta cycle in which they were emitted.</p><p id="P23">Measuring the gamma-dependent spatio-temporal correlation between spike pairs lead to two results. First, fields characterized by a strong phase locking showed a significant degree of spike ordering, independent of the gamma configuration at the time of the spike emission. Second, phase precessing fields, on the contrary, presented a variable amount of temporal ordering, depending on the slow-medium gamma balance. Crucially, spatio-temporal correlation of spike pairs was only present in coincidence with strong slow gamma periods, that is, only at times when phase precession was at its weakest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Therefore the ability to carry information about macro-scale ordering of place fields within the micro-scale arrangement of spikes at the tens of milliseconds scale differ across fields, and depends on the current state of the networks generating gamma in CA1. Importantly, the states of these gamma networks conducive to phase precession and to pairwise ordering of spikes appeared to be complementary to one another. Pairwise interactions between fields provided a first approximation to evaluate the degree of which neural activity in CA1 place cells populations is sequentially organized. We took this analysis a step further by implementing a decoding procedure, aimed at estimating the level of sequential information contained in the entire population of recorded place cells. Because this type of analysis cannot distinguish between spikes belonging to different fields of the same place cell, we extended our definition of ’locking’ and ’precessing’ to cells rather than single fields. Each cell was assigned the identity of its place field with the highest firing rate (Field 1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, when multiple fields were present). By dividing each theta cycle into a set of small sub-windows, we computed the likelihood of the activity contained in each of them to encode one of the positions of the track. Using these probability density matrices, we evaluated the degree of non-locality of the encoded positions, that is to what degree the encoded positions within a theta cycle a) reflected the current position of the mouse on the track or b) formed a “theta sequence”, that is, they represented a set of positions sequentially distributed in time around and independently from the current position of the animal. Again, such computation was repeated separately using spikes from either the entire population, or from specific groups of cells and also by subdividing theta cycles according to the corresponding slow-medium gamma power balance. Results obtained with Bayesian decoding confirmed and expanded those based on pairwise measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). We first considered the temporal organization of the positional and sequential coding scores by computing the auto-correlation of the scores obtained for theta periods at different time lags. The encoding of sequences showed almost no temporal correlation already in neighbouring theta cycles, while positional coding appeared to retain some degree of continuity within short stretches of theta cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). As partially expected by their definition, the two scores turned out to be anti-correlated within the same theta cycle. The spatial information content carried by either locking and precessing cells was found to be different and to be gamma-modulated (similarly to what found with pairwise ordering): while on average precessing cells better encoded position, the representation of spatial sequences over the course of a theta cycle was selectively enhanced in precessing cells during periods of strong slow gamma power. During periods dominated by medium gamma instead the sequential coding was comparable in the two populations of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Indeed when we directly measured the effects of relative gamma balance in each of the two populations,we found no effect in the locking group and an enhancement of sequential coding for precessing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Interestingly such increase in sequential-like activation in precessing cells led to a widening of the position-to-sequence score range (computed as a difference between the two scores). That is, during slow gamma periods each theta cycle was more strongly biased towards either positional or sequential coding. We directly measured this temporal segregation of spatial-related coding schemes by measuring the cycle-by-cycle correlation of the two scores. On top of the previously noted anti-correlation, we found a gamma-induced modulation in precessing cells. Consistently with the previous measure of the score difference variance, the anti-correlation between the two scores was found to be stronger during periods of slow gamma prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). Consistently with our previous analysis, thus, the population approach confirmed that for specific subsets of cells phase precession and sequential coding emerged in CA1 under different network conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Independent spatial coding in hippocampal sub-populations</title><p id="P24">We then asked how the instantaneous expression of a specific spatial coding scheme coordinated across the CA1 network. To do so we first computed again the pairwise spatio-temporal correlation we used before, but this time considering cell pairs across the two cell groups of locking and precessing fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that slow gamma modulations reshaped these groups: an increase in the slow gamma power coincided with an increase in the pairwise score for cell pairs within the same theta-score group (thus strengthening sequential coding within each group) and a small but significant decrease in the correlation of across-group pairs (although this effect was stronger for precessing cells), thus decoupling the two groups. When medium gamma dominated, the cell pair slopes calculated within and across groups were indistinguishable, and were also not different from reshuffling the theta scores across cells from the same session. Together, these data suggest that slow gamma increases order in the precessing and in the locking group separately.</p><p id="P25">We observed a similar phenomenon when considering the results of Bayesian decoding. In this case we compared the decoding scores obtained from different place cell groups for the same theta cycle. Inspecting the distribution of this simultaneous decoding score combining locking and precessing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) we observed that while for positional coding points tended to concentrate around the diagonal (indicating a high degree of coordination between the coding in the two group of cells), in the case of sequential coding points tended instead to be located away from the diagonal, especially for increasing values of the score, showing that the two groups express theta sequences in separate theta sequences and rarely simultaneously. We quantified this effect by measuring the average distance of points from the diagonal as a function of the combined decoding score for each theta cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). This analysis confirmed our previous observation, showing a significant distancing of high-score sequential events from the diagonal and a substantial uniformity in the case of positional coding.</p><p id="P26">Finally we compared the place field shape in the different temporal windows defined in our analysis. First, the effect of gamma modulation was identified in a backward shift of place fields in correspondence with periods of high slow gamma power, with the effect being stronger for precessing fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, top panels). Then we also observed that identifying temporal windows based on the nature of the expressed spatial coding (either positional or sequential) led to a measurable change in the shape of place fields. In fact, when taking only periods characterized by an high degree of sequential organization of spikes resulted in the flattening of the measured place field shape, with no observable rate tuning left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom panels).</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, further evidence for the presence of a theta-score based segregation of cell groups organizing in theta sequences was given by looking at the enlargement of fields when detecting sequences separately for locking or precessing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>). Indeed we could observe a double dissociation: periods of precessing cell detected sequences corresponded to an enlargement of precessing cell fields, but to no significant modulation in the locking cell fields, and vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The data we presented here highlights the heterogeneity of temporal coding schemes in CA1 activity. We first showed that phase precession is not a general feature of place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Rather, we observed a continuum between purely phase locked and phase precessing fields, with no or very little correlation with spatial tuning and neural activity parameters. Fields at the “precessing” and “locked” ends of this spectrum differ in non space-related properties, such as their theta phase locking during active behavior (or during REM sleep; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>), suggesting that intrinsic differences in anatomy and physiology, as for example belonging to the deep or superficial pyramidal sublayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] may affect only to some extent a place field’s propensity to phase precess. Yet, by analyzing phase precession as a function of location on the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) we show that the same place cell may substantially vary its phase precessing behavior at different locations on the track. Thus, intrinsic cell properties may explain only a small portion of the total variance at best, and the causes of phase precession may have to be searched not only in the circuit layout, but, most poignantly, in the precise constellation of inputs, cellular and network states affecting a neuron in a given contingency.</p><p id="P29">Second, when looking on a theta cycle-by cycle basis, CA1 population activity either expresses a forwardsweeping (on average, but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]) sequence, or a stable representation of animal location. The sequential content of the representation fluctuates very rapidly, and the probabilities to observe theta sequences in consecutive theta cycles are virtually uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Third, theta sequences are not expression of the CA1 cell population as a whole. Rather, locking and precessing subpopulations may form, at least momentarily, separate coherent groups, as shown by the fact that they express theta sequences independently and at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, it is possible that one group expresses a sequence while the other encodes current position. Whether a single “position readout” decoded from CA1 activity is fully representative of information processing in the hippocampus is called into question by these results.</p><p id="P30">Fourth, rather than being one the cause of the other, phase precession and theta sequences are by-and-large independent, if not downright in opposition, meaning that they tend to occur at different moments, at least in one group of cells. Our results point at different CA1 inputs being responsible for the two phenomena, with CA3 inputs being conducive to sequences and Entorhinal LIII inputs to precession. It has been previously shown that strong slow gamma periods (putatively, with predominant CA3 influence) are related to tighter theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. We show here that the effect is to be ascribed to phase precessing fields only, whereas cells that do not exhibit phase precession reliably show sequences regardless of gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, increased medium gamma intensity (proxy for EC LIII inputs) is related to tighter phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Here as well, we show that this is only due to the phase precessing fields, whereas phase locking cells never precess. Furthermore, we characterize how the phase precession pattern arises as a new cluster of spikes emerges in the position by firing phase plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), at the trough of the slm theta. That cluster of spikes may act as a disturbance for theta sequence expression, causing the decline in sequence score displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p id="P31">The phase precession phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] and its links to theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] have been the object of multiple theories and models. We believe that high level of heterogeneity and temporal variability shown here represents a challenge for all those mechanistic theories. Instead, a simpler account by F. Chance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] fit the present data quite well. In this model - as already hypothesized by Yamaguchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]) – spikes form two clusters in the animal position by theta phase plane. The cluster corresponding to entry into the place field and later phase is ascribed to CA3 inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). EC3 inputs would be instead responsible for the spike cluster at the exit of the place field. The theta phases of the two clusters is consistent with CA3 inputs lagging EC3 inputs by a quarter theta cycle. If we assume that medium gamma covaries with the EC3 inputs strength, that model would explain the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> (and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The Chance model, augmented with time-fluctuating CA3 and EC3 input strengths, and slow and medium gamma intensity being their respective proxies, is consistent with a number of observations in the literature. In particular, the model would predict the fact that slow gamma induces a backward (prospective coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]) shift in place field location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] whereas the field moves forward (retrospective coding) with elevated medium gamma. We reproduced this effect in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Furthermore, spike-triggered averages of medium and slow gamma power respectively increase and decrease with place field traversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] (also reproduced here <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref>).</p><p id="P32">As an important technical aside, here we recorded laminarly resolved LFP and neural ensembles are recorded from separate sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which avoids any spillovers of spiking activity in the LFP, which may bias LFP-spikes association measures. We then used a novel analytical procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>), derived from ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] to separate the different generators at different hippocampal layers, making explicit use of preferred theta phase information. It is possible that some discrepant results in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] are due to different approaches in computing the time series of gamma intensity.</p><p id="P33">In sum, we show here that there is a cell population, hereby named “phase precessing”, that shows a broader range of temporal coding regimes, and changes most markedly as the input balance in CA1 changes, with respect to the rest of CA1 neurons. The makeup of this group varies even from one spatial location to the next. An enticing hypothesis is that the distribution of inputs on the dendritic tree is the determinant of this behavior. Dendritic targeting interneurons may shift the balance of the inputs between CA3 and EC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. It is also known that EC3 inputs induce “plateau potentials” in CA1 pyramids’ distal apical dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and that these may last for hundreds of milliseconds, possibly linking inputs occurring within that time interval. The testable prediction is that cells that would be classified here as phase precessing are those that are mostly activated by dendritic branches under the tightest interneuronal control and/or expressing more plateau potentials. Which dendritic branches activate a neuron is likely to change from one location to the next, and may explain the shift in the cell’s temporal coding properties.</p><p id="P34">Our data suggests that CA1, the output stage of the hippocampus, does not condense one single representation of “position” for upstream areas, but rather multiplexes multiple transformation of the hippocampal inputs, and autonomously generated representations.

These regions are found by requiring the laplace operator to be negative.

Such operation was repeated for the CSD computed for each contact of the probe. After this double thresholding, each of the layer-specific coupling matrices was then reduced to a sparse version in which only significantly coupled regions had non-zero values.

Letting the state of each neuron at time t depend on the state of the population in the previous time step t – 1, the maximum entropy distribution over the state <italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) of neuron i at time t is <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">cosh</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a time dependant covariate having the role of the external field in statistical physics.

For each of these spikes we also computed the simultaneous slow/medium gamma power ratio which we then used as a label to further subdivide the spikes. We then considered all the cell pairs in the population of simultaneously recorded place cells. Each pair (A,B) of place cells was then defined by i) the spatial distance between the place fields of cell A and B (computed as the distance between the centers of mass, but using the distance between the fields peaks did not change the results) and ii) the average phase interval between the spikes of the two cells. The latter was computed by taking spikes of cell A as reference and within each theta cycle (for which a spike from both cells was available) taking the <italic>dθ<sub>A−&gt;B</sub></italic>(<italic>k</italic>) (where k stands for the kth theta cycle), that is the (signed) difference between the phase of the spike of cell A and that of cell B spike.

Spatial distance and phase distance were then arranged in a 2-dimensional space and the average phase offset was computed over different ranges of spatial distances as long as at least 10 pairs of cells were available.

Using the normalized probability density, for each theta cycle we computed two scores.

The same procedure was applied using different set of cells to compute the probability density, so to obtain an estimation of the spatial information carried by specific cell groups (in our case, the entire population and either phase precessing or phase locking cells). Theta cycles were further classified according to the simultaneously expressed gamma power ratio. The average ratio between the power of slow and medium gamma over the interval of the theta oscillation was used as a label for that theta cycle and used to subdivide the set of cycles depending on the relative strength of the slow and medium gamma component. These scores were used to evaluate the content of activity in different theta cycles. An additional step was then taken to compare the nature of activity across different cell populations. In this case the decoding scores obtained from each cell group were first normalized to <italic>max</italic><sub>Θ</sub>ϒ = 1 (where the max is taken over all available theta cycles). For each theta cycle in which enough spikes were emitted by cells from both independent cell groups we computed the difference between the two obtained decoding scores ϒ<sub>1</sub> and ϒ<sub>2</sub> (either Local or NonLocal) as the distance of the point (ϒ<sub>1</sub>, ϒ<sub>2</sub>) from the equal-score diagonal ϒ<sub>1</sub> = ϒ<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P55">Data analyses were performed using custom MATLAB scripts (The Math Works).

The red arrow points to the silicon probe entry point. Right: Adapted image from the 2D coronal reference atlas, all CA1 layers. Image credit: Allen Institute. (D) Schematics of the linear track paradigm. 10 consecutive days of training without food or water deprivation. (E) Example of a linear track session from late training days (Day 10). Top: directions of motion are highlighted in two different colors (light pink: up; light blue: down). Bottom: velocity profiles are superimposed on the each lap of the session. (F) Behavioral performance of all animals across the 10 days of linear track training. Average performance is highlighted in dark blue. (G) Color coded depth profile of current sink and sources. LFP traces are superimposed in black. Silicon probe contacts (indicated on the left) span all CA1 layers and partially reach the Molecular Layer (ML) and the Granular Cell Layer (GCL) of the Dentate Gyrus (DG).

Furthermore, we assume two groups of neurons, “locking” and “precessing”, which form theta sequences independently and at different times. Similarly, phase precession is not expressed homogeneously by all CA1 place cells, but is modulated as a function of space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). When slow gamma dominates (left), cells that should phase precess at that location only fire at the theta phase of maximal CA3 inputs. Spiking takes place in the initial portion of the place field, so that spatial tuning is prospective. Both phase locked and phase precessing cells display theta sequences (independently) in this state. The full phase precession pattern appears in the “precessing” subset of cells when medium gamma is strongest (right). For those cells, a second cluster of spikes appears on the position-phase plane, shifted towards an earlier theta phase, corresponding to EC LIII activation and to a further position in the place field. The relative position of the two clusters gives rise to the phase precession effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Bursts are most prominent in the second cluster, suggesting the influence of dendritic dynamics triggered by EC LIII afferents depolarizing distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The interference between spikes in the two clusters disrupts theta sequences, which are still apparent in phase locked cells. This state may favor the combination of memory-derived and new sensory information.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS147039-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
