Despite significant advances in the understanding mechanism of olfaction, currently, there are no objective non-invasive methods that can identify loss of smell. Covid-19-related loss of smell has highlighted the need to develop methods that can identify loss of olfaction. Voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7) plays a critical role in olfaction by aiding the signal propagation to the olfactory bulb. We have identified several conditions such as chronic inflammation and viral infections such as Covid-19 that lead to loss of smell correlate with downregulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression at transcript and protein levels in the olfactory epithelium. Leveraging this knowledge, we have developed a novel fluorescent probe Tsp1a-IR800 that targets Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. Using fluorescence imaging we can objectively measure the loss of sense of smell in live animals non-invasively. We also demonstrate that our non-invasive method is semiquantitative because the loss of fluorescence intensity correlates with the level of smell loss. Our results indicate, that our probe Tsp1a-IR800, can objectively diagnose anosmia in animal and human subjects using infrared fluorescence. We believe this method to non-invasively diagnose loss of smell objectively is a significant advancement in relation to current methods that rely on highly subjective behavioral studies and can aid in studying olfaction loss and the development of therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The sense of smell (Olfaction) is critical for survival of animals including humans because smells convey information about the food, environment and serves as tools for inter- and intra-species communication. The loss of sense of smell (Anosmia), resulting from Covid-19 associated neurological sequelae has captured several headlines over past two years and has highlighted the need for gaining deeper mechanistinc understanding and developing tools to probe such disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This also has shed light on general olfaction disorders associated with several diseases because anosmia has a tremendous negative impact on the individual quality of life and public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. A staggering 13.3 million adults in US were found to have smell disorders, including 3.4 million with severe hyposmia/anosmia. These studies has been conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, and these numbers can change drastically with millions of infections and due to long Covid-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Despite such a fundamental importance in biology and high prevelance of Anosmia, we do not have an objective method to measure perception of smell. The perception of smell like other senses is subject reported and therefore a non-independent measure. This also implies, we do not have any objective tools to detect presence or absence of olfaction in animal models. This has resulted in reliance on behavioral studies that are not only challenging but are indirect and highly subjective. This has impaired investigations in animal models, and, thereby, developing new therapeutic interventions for anosmia. Therefore, there is an urgent and compelling need to develop tools that can measure sense of smell in human and animal models.</p><p id="P5">To develop a diagnostic method for olfaction, we explored the potential of voltage gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7). We reasoned that sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-1.9) are crucial members in neurotransmission and aid in propagation of action poetential/impulse along the nerve bundles and dysfuntion of these channels might lead to impaired olfaction. Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 encoded by SCN9A gene is expressed predominantly in peripheral sensory neurons and the axons of human olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and plays a critical role in olfaction among mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In OSNs, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 is critical for transmitting olfactory cues provided by olfactory receptor activation to higher-order neurons in the brain. It has been established that dysfunction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 resulting from mutations in the SCN9A gene encoding Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 or loss of these sodium channels at the level of olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium (OE) results in smell disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The presence of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in superficial layer of the OE presents an unprecedented opportunity to develop optical probes that can non-invasively image expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. By objectively measuring changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression in OE we can potentially identify smell disorders in patients and animals by measuring changes.</p><p id="P6">In the current manuscript we first establish that Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 is a bona fide target for olfaction by demonstrating that conditions such as viral infections or inflammation resulting from allergies or drugs, that leads to the loss of odorant perception, results in diminished expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in the superficial layer of the OE. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, hamsters and humans have diminished Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression in the OSN using either immunohistochemistry (IHC), single cell and/or bulk RNA-seq. Taking advantage of a potent and subtype-selective peptide Tsp1a isolated from Peruvian tarantula that targets Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, we have developed fluorescent imaging agents that can aid visualization of peripheral nerves <italic>in vivo</italic> without any side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Using a fluorophore (IR800) that is better suited for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging applications and clinical translation, we have genearated and characterized Tsp1a-IR800 that is specific for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. We demonstrate that Tsp1a-IR800 can be used to non-invasively image Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 on OE in mice models using epifluorescence imaging and that methimazole induced chronic inflammation anosmia can be non-invasively detected by our imaging probe Tsp1a-IR800. In non-human primate (NHP) imaging studies with Tsp1a-IR800 <italic>(i.v.)</italic> the fluorescent intensity of the NHP olfactory epithelium was significantly higher compared to surrounding tissues. Our IHC studies indicate human OE expresses Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and its expression is downregulated in Covid-19 patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that our fluorescent imaging probe Tsp1a-IR800 targeting Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels can serve as a non-invasive imaging tool for anosmia.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Synthesis of Tsp1a-IR800</title><p id="P7">Synthetic Tsp1a was prepared as in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].

For scRNA-seq we analyzed 68.951 cells and identified 13 cell subtypes using previously described markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. SCN9A was predominantly expressed in OSN’s and olfactory glia with minimal to zero expression in other cell subtypes in the OE. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters we observed a 3-fold drop in the expression of the SCN9A gene transcripts in OSNs at 3 dpi, and full restoration of expression at 10 dpi with bulk RNA-seq analysis (p&lt;0.001). These changes in SCN9A transcripts can be followed on UMAP clustering maps that show temporal downregulation of SCN9A. At 3 dpi, the transcript levels are significantly diminished compared to control as well as 1 dpi and are restored to pre-infection levels 10 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a, b, c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces downregulation of the SCN9A gene in human OSN</title><p id="P27">We analyzed whether changes in SCN9A expression in ROEB observed in COVID-19 infected mice and hamsters is also observed in human OSNs post COVID-19 infection. The region of the cribriform plate located at the roof of the nasal cavity was resected, as a region with a high density of mature OSNs from 5 control and 18 infected human cadavers. We performed bulk RNA sequencing of olfactory epithelium tissues from the resected specimens. Cadavers were donated from patients of different sex (9 males, 16 females), with the median age of patients being 73 years (IQR 65-78), representing a variety of infection duration, hospital stay, treatment and postmortem interval. We have previously demonstrated that despite different postmortem times for collecting the samples, only minimal influence on the cellular constitution of tissues and immune cells in OE of humans could be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all positive OE tissues with variations in the viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].

The excitation was set to 750 nm and emission was set to 794 nm. We designed our probe to have these features because there is minimal background at these wavelengths to provide a highly specific signal. Because of superficial expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in the mouse ROEB, we were able to obtain images of the mice without need to expose the olfactory epithelium. Epifluorescence <italic>in vivo</italic> images in mice receiving IV injection with the imaging agent Tsp1a-IR800 generated high contrast between the ROEB and its surrounding regions. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the unmodified peptide (blocking agent) in combination with the imaging agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We observed a 150-fold increase in radiant efficiency compared to mice injected with PBS. To demonstrate specificity we co-administered our imaging probe with non-fluorophore labeled TSP1a and observed a 61-fold decrease in signal emanating from the mouse OE. For further confirmation, we resected the olfactory epithelium region of these mice and obtained regular tabletop fluorescent microscopy images of sectioned tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The fluorescent microscopy images confirm the results of <italic>in vivo</italic> epifluorescence imaging and IHC. OSN and olfactory nerve bundles located in the lamina propria showed the most intense fluorescence. Normosmic mice and mice treated with blocking agent were negative for any signal (red), while only nuclear-associated blue staning was visible corresponding to nuclear staining by Hoechst dye.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Chemically induced Anosmia can be monitored using fluorescence imaging with Tsp1a-IR800</title><p id="P29">Mice treated with methimazole that is known to cause damage to olfactory nerves had visibly diminished fluorescence signal (radiant efficiency) compared to normosmic control mice when imaged with Tsp1a-IR800. The ROEB of methimazole-treated mice had a 8-fold decrease in radiant efficiency compared to normosmic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D&amp;E</xref>). The average radiant efficiency of the olfactory region of normosmic mice imaged from both sides were 4.08E+09 (s.d. 2.11E+09), compared to 5.33E+08 (s.d. 2.08E+08) for mice with an olfactory ablation (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.045). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> images showed a similar statistically significant difference between mouse groups in the ROEB (do we have supplemental data figure?).

Normosmic mice were able to find buried food in less than 30 s, compared with average time of 135 s for olfactory-ablated mice (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between the <underline>Tsp1a-IR800</underline> radiant efficiency and the time required to find buried food (Pearson correlation coefficient r = –0.79, n=10, p=0.0056; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression in olfactory epithelium of non-human primates (NHP) can be detected using fluorescence imaging of Tsp1a-IR800 with clinically approved near-infrared (NIR) endoscopy systems</title><p id="P31">To validate the clinical potential of our approach of the imaging Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression as a surrogate marker for sense of smell, we performed experiments in non-human primates (NHP) using the Quest NIR imaging system that is approved for clinical use. After IV administration of Tsp1a-IR800, tissues were harvested. The bright fluorescence is clearly visible over the olfactory epithelium, and weak or no fluorescence is detected over the muscle, olfactory bulb, and brain. The fluorescence intensity of olfactory epithelium was significantly higher compared to all other measured tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A&amp;B</xref>). Furthermore, we performed fluorescence microscopy of the dissected non-human primate tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The fluorescence signal from the NHP olfactory epithelium was clearly brighter compared to other tissues. It is important to realize that the olfactory bulb expresses Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 but the blood brain barrier (BBB) prevents the entry of our imaging agent in the current setting. For the current application, this is a significant advantage because it reduces potential background signal from Olfactory bulb.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">We describe development of a novel semi-quantitative diagnostic method based on selective targeting of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression in olfactory epithelium for detection of smell disorders induced by different insults and inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19. The fluorescence signal emanating from mouse OE shows decreased intensity when mouse have Anosmia. There was inverse linear relationship between signal intensity and the degree of damage. Therefore we believe it has potential to serve as an objective guide to assess disease progression as well as treatment response both in animal and human subjects. The ability to asses olfaction in animal models opens new avenues for drug development and testing. All current diagnostic methods are based on a smell perception of the afflicted patients and are subjective by design. Despite being standardized and validated, these methods are culturally specific and individually subjective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Certain odors may not be familiar to those outside the geographic region where the test had been developed. Moreover, odor identification methods only can diagnose the presence of a problem, but not the site of the damage or etiology. The only existing method that can do both is an invasive surgical biopsy that can lead to tissue destruction. However, the invasive nature of the procedure limits its use in multiple ways. Furthermore, in animal studies, only behavioral experiments are available to measure smell loss, which cannot be repeated often, can give non consistent results and will not detect early changes. Because of the objective nature of our approach, we believe it opens a completely new paradigm to detect olfaction in animal subjects.</p><p id="P33">A new diagnostic method, that is non-invasive, can be easily and repeatedly performed during a routine exam, and can help to diagnose the level of damage is crucially important. The absence of a good diagnostic method hampers any efforts in developing a novel treatment strategy that is tailored to a specific cause. You cannot treat central and peripheral causes of anosmia the same way. Moreover, the method should be able to detect the restoration process before noticeable improvement in sense of smell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P34">We have identified that smell loss due to chronic inflammation in the nasal cavity or viral infection all are accompanied with the diminished expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channels. We observed loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel expression following olfactory ablation using methimazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels was substantially reduced in the OSN, and nerve bundles located in lamina propria, whereas it was less affected at the level of olfactory bulbs.</p><p id="P35">Further, we assessed whether COVID-19-related olfaction loss is also accompanied with the loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channels. COVID-19-related smell disorders are possibly caused by multiple mechanisms. There is a direct tropism of the virus to sustentacular and microvillar cells covering the OSN, inflammatory damage to OSN, as they are exposed to environmental factors, and inflammation involving focal mucosal swelling and obstruction to airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Recently, our collaborators and co-authors on this publication described that downregulation of odor detection pathways as a potential cause of COVID-19 induced anosmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. We found out that together these mechanisms cause diminished Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel expression in the OSN, and olfactory nerve bundles located in the nasal cavity as shown by IHC and RNA sequencing on tissues from mice, hamsters, and humans.</p><p id="P36">Our compound Tsp1a-IR800 selectively binds to Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channel, making it ideal candidate to measure smell perception using fluorescent measurement technics. We tested our imaging agent using a mouse model in which olfactory ablation was achieved via methimazole injections. This damage follows a similar sensorineural smell loss pattern seen in upper-respiratory viral infection or chronic inflammation due to seasonal allergies. After iv injection of the compound, we observed diminished radiance efficiency in mice with ablated OE, compared with the normosmic mice. Further, we have detected that the extent of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 expression as measured by radiant efficiency of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 imaging agent was inversely correlated with the time mouse spent finding food in a buried food test.</p><p id="P37">The difference between small mammals and humans can be substantial, and to validate the possibility to image olfaction in humans, we injected the compound to a healthy non-human primate. For imaging of fluorescence, we have used clinically approved NIR imaging machine. We observed bright fluorescence from the olfactory epithelium, and the fluorescence measurements were significantly higher compared with surrounding tissues.</p><p id="P38">As described above, it is crucial to develop a non-invasive, fast, and objective method to diagnose smell disorders. Intravenously injected Tsp1a-IR800 selectively accumulates in OSN and olfactory nerve bundles located in the nasal cavity. Existing flexible endoscopes from several medical technology companies (Quest, Stryker, Olympus etc.) can detect the IR wavelength emitted by Tsp1a-IR800 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Due to the minimally invasive nature of the nasal cavity scope, the correlation of fluorescence with the magnitude of smell loss the method can be used as a treatment monitoring tool, and in the development of therapeutic treatments. In addition, the method can be widely used in an experimental setting, to objectively measure smell in animals replacing the need to perform behavioral experiments and streamline the development of new therapeutics or investigating diseases linked with smell disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the support of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Animal Imaging Core Facility and Molecular Cytology Core Facility.
