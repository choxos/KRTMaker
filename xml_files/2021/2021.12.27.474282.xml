<abstract>
<p id="P1">Waning immunity to COVID-19 vaccination is associated with increased risk of breakthrough infection, especially with highly transmissible variants of concern (VOC). Booster vaccination generates rapid immune recall in humans, which real-world observational studies suggest protects against VOC infection and associated disease, and modeling studies suggest could mitigate community spread. We directly tested the impact of booster vaccination on protection against Delta VOC infection, disease, and transmission to naïve cohorts in golden Syrian hamsters. Animals with waning immunity to bnt162b2 generated rapid immune recall and strong protection against upper- and lower-respiratory tract infection when boosted with bnt126b2, mRNA-1273 or AZD1222. Boosting with either mRNA vaccine generated moderate protection against lung inflammation and virus transmission to unvaccinated animals. Our data support booster vaccination as a tool to address emerging VOC in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">Accumulating real-world evidence demonstrates that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 wanes significantly within 3-8 months of vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Waning immunity is associated with decreased vaccine efficacy, especially against infection and mild disease, but also (although to a lesser extent) against severe disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Breakthrough infection is most common with highly transmissible VOC such as Delta and Omicron, which replicate quickly, partially evade antibodies elicited by vaccination against the ancestral strain, and represent most SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Third dose boosting campaigns have therefore been initiated in many countries, with recent observational studies demonstrating a rapid increase in serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer and breadth against highly transmissible VOC concomitant with a decrease in infection rate and associated disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Modeling studies have also suggested that booster vaccination could reduce community transmission <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. While these data are encouraging, the impact of booster vaccination after waning immunity has not been determined in a rigorously controlled experimental setting. Studies in preclinical models would be highly complementary to real-world data, as they allow for control over important variables such as the duration, dose, and timing of virus exposure as well as behaviors that could influence infection susceptibility. They also enable direct assessment of virus infection and associated pathology in the lung, which should provide insight into booster vaccination effectiveness beyond its impact on disease symptoms.</p>
<p id="P3">We therefore conducted a Delta VOC challenge-transmission study in golden Syrian hamsters immunized for 9 months with bnt162b2 and then boosted with a third dose of either bnt162b2, mRNA-1273 or AZD1222 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). As expected, naïve hamsters vaccinated with two doses of bnt162b2 separated by 21 days generated a robust serum NAb response against SARS-CoV-2, as measured by pseudovirus PRNT<sub>50</sub> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Mean serum NAb titers peaked on day 35 to levels similar to those measured in humans 35 days after an identical vaccination regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Once peaked, serum NAb titers waned progressively until becoming undetectable on day 250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These data confirm waning immunity to mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in the golden Syrian hamster, as was shown recently after natural infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. The similarity to which serum NAb titers were generated and then waned relative to humans provides support for the hamster as a high-fidelity model for studying booster vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">On day 275, hamsters were boosted with 5ug bnt162b2, 15ug mRNA-1273 or 8e9 particles AZD1222, which are doses normalized to the clinical dosing regimen in humans. Booster vaccination was well tolerated and generated rapid serum NAb recall against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Serum NAb titers increased by 3 days and reached mean NT<sub>50</sub> of 435±223, 234±994 and 138±108 for bnt162b2, mRNA-1273, and AZD1222, respectively, at 10 days. The kinetics and strength of NT<sub>50</sub> recall are similar to those reported in humans boosted 3-8 months after primary mRNA vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> and above serum NAb titers determined to be protective in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Fifteen days after booster vaccination, hamsters were challenged intranasally with 1e5 plaque forming units (pfu) Delta VOC. Unvaccinated hamsters lost weight post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and generated modest serum NAb titers against authentic Delta VOC by day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These animals supported high infectious viral titers in the upper (nasal swab on day 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and lower (lung on day 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) respiratory tract and prominent N-reactivity in alveoli and bronchial epithelium on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-g</xref>). They also had pronounced inflammation in the lung, characterized by variable peribronchial, perivascular and peripheral inflammation involving the alveolar septae and spaces (consisting mainly of mononuclear cells), prominent neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates with involvement of the vascular wall, and focal fibrosis within the small airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a, b</xref>). These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that golden Syrian hamsters are highly susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated inflammation in the lung <sup>

</sup>

</p>
<p id="P6">As compared to unvaccinated animals, hamsters with waning immunity to bnt162b2 lost less weight after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and generated a stronger anamnestic serum NAb response to authentic Delta VOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These animals supported similar infectious viral titers in URT on day 2 but less on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), consistent with human studies reporting similar peak viral load in URT but accelerated viral clearance in breakthrough compared to primary infection with Delta VOC <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. In the lungs, fewer infectious particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and N-reactive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-g</xref>) were detected in hamsters with waning immunity, as was reported in monkeys challenged with Delta VOC one year after vaccination with mRNA-1273 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. However, a similar degree of lung inflammation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Collectively, these data show that hamsters with waning immunity to bnt162b2 are highly susceptible to URT infection by Delta VOC but clear it faster than unvaccinated animals and are modestly- to highly susceptible to infection and associated inflammation in the lung, respectively. A qualitatively similar response was recently reported in hamsters with waning immunity to natural infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Hamsters delivered a booster vaccine lost similar weight to non-boosted animals by day 2 post-challenge but began to recover their weight by day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These animals generated a strong anamnestic serum NAb response to authentic Delta VOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), supported fewer infectious viral titers in URT on day 2 and day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), supported no detectable infectious viral titers in lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and harbored fewer cells with N-reactivity in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-g</xref>). There were no differences between animals boosted with bnt162b2, mRNA1273 or AZD1222 in any of these measures. However, the impact of booster vaccination on lung inflammation after Delta VOC challenge diverged between groups, where a third dose of bnt162b2 was most protective, followed by mRNA-1273 and then AZD1222, which generated no measurable protection on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with recent reports that bnt162b2, mRNA-1273 and adenovirus-vectored booster vaccines generate rapid and functional immune recall in humans with waning immunity to a primary bnt162b2 vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. They also raise the prospect that third dose bnt162b2 vaccination after waning immunity to bnt162b2 offers superior protection against lung inflammation than either mRNA-1273 or AZD1222.</p>
<p id="P8">Finally, we sought to determine whether booster vaccination protects hamsters with waning immunity from spreading Delta VOC to unvaccinated animals. Twenty-four hours after challenge, hamsters were co-housed 1:1 with naive hamsters. Co-housed animals were separated by a porous aluminum barrier and then moved into individual cages after 24 hours. Nasal swabs were taken 48 hours after cohousing. As expected, naïve hamsters co-housed with unvaccinated-challenged hamsters were robustly infected by Delta VOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), to even higher levels than challenged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Naïve hamsters co-housed with animals with waning immunity had ~3-fold lower infectious viral titers in nasal swabs at 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, naïve hamsters co-housed with animals boosted with bnt162b2 or mRNA-1273 (but not AZD1222) had &gt;10-fold lower viral titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These data show that hamsters with waning immunity are partly protected from transmitting Delta VOC to unvaccinated animals, and that boosting with bnt162b2 or mRNA-1273 generates further protection in these experimental conditions.</p>
<p id="P9">Our results complement real-world studies in humans showing waning immunity after primary vaccination concomitant with decreased protection against VOC infection and disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Also complementary is the rapid immune recall generated by booster vaccination that is associated with increased protection against VOC infection and disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. We add to these observations direct evidence that booster vaccination reduces Delta VOC infectious viral load in the URT and lung and generates measurable protection against lung inflammation and viral transmission to unvaccinated animals. The protection against URT infection and transmission is noteworthy, as bnt162b2, mRNA-1273 and AZD1222 were not designed to generate mucosal immunity, but rather protect against severe disease. A decrease in URT viral load post-breakthrough infection with Delta VOC after bnt162b2 booster vaccination was also reported in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Whether this would hold for even more transmissible VOC such as Omicron remains unknown, but even a modest decrease in URT load and viral transmission could have a significant beneficial impact on community spread. It is also noteworthy that animals boosted with AZD1222 were protected against URT and lung infection but not lung inflammation or viral transmission. This is consistent with a recent observational study showing that bnt162b2 vaccination protected against transmission better than ADZ1222 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. One explanation is that AZD1222 was less effective at boosting cellular immunity, which could have changed the inflammatory response in the lung. As transmission is influenced by both infectious viral load and animal behavior (e.g., breathing rate, coughing, sneezing, etc.), the elevated lung inflammation may have altered animal behavior in ways that facilitated viral spread even though viral load was similar.</p>
<p id="P10">Our study has several limitations. First, as direct intranasal challenge forces a breakthrough infection, our study was designed to evaluate the impact of booster vaccination on the severity of breakthrough infection but not its incidence, which observational studies have shown is reduced by booster vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, cohousing animals for 24 hours at peak URT infection is an extreme model of transmission. Together these factors lead us to speculate that our study underestimates the overall beneficial impact of booster vaccination in the real world. Second, the size of each experimental group was small. This substantially impacted our statistical power, especially when the effect size was small (e.g., transmission, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) or the biological variability was high (e.g., anamnestic response, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As such, our interpretations are sometimes based on non-significant data trends. Third, there are few validated antibody reagents for hamster studies, which limited our ability to probe cellular immunity or assess lung inflammation in depth. The cellular infiltration measured on H&amp;E likely represents both pathological and physiological inflammation. Moreover, our assessment on day 4 only captures a snapshot of the inflammatory response to Delta VOC. Fourth, our study did not track the kinetics or durability of immune response beyond 10 days post-boost. A recent study in humans showed that bnt162b2-boosted immunity peaked within 2 weeks whereas adenovirus-vectored vaccine (Ad26)-boosted immunity continued to rise until at least 1 month <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The differences we observed between the mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 may therefore have resulted from the timing of Delta VOC challenge after boost.</p>
<p id="P11">We conclude that booster immunization with clinically relevant COVID-19 vaccines generates rapid protection against Delta VOC challenge in animals with waning immunity. However, because protection was incomplete and highly transmissible VOC such as Omicron continue to emerge <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>, our study supports the development of more effective booster vaccines, potentially including intranasally-delivered, variant-specific and/or multi-valent formulations, and indicate that non-pharmaceutic interventions may still be required to curb infection and disease as the pandemic evolves.</p>

<p id="P12">Animal experiments and procedures were approved by The University of Calgary Health Sciences Animal Care Committee (AC20-0053) and the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP00001847). 6–8-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters (Charles River, Strain Code 049) were used for primary bnt162b2 vaccination and 9-month-old male hamsters were used as age-matched unvaccinated controls for the Delta VOC challenge. Hamsters were vaccinated on day 0 and again on day 21 with a 5 μg dose of bnt162b2 by bilateral injection (2x50 μL) into the caudal muscle. Blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding and serum harvested and stored using a standard procedure. Booster vaccination was done with 5 μg BNT162b2, 15 μg mRNA-1273, or 8e9 viral particles AZD1222 delivered by bilateral caudal muscle injection. All vaccines were acquired from Alberta Health Services (AHS) vaccine clinics after the human doses had been used. Remnant vaccine from each vial was pooled and injected into animals within 6 hours. Fifteen days after booster vaccination (or non-boosted control), animals were challenged in biosafety level 3 with 1e5 plaque forming unit (pfu) of sequence-verified Delta VOC in a total volume of 100 μL delivered intranasal 50μL per nare. Animals were monitored daily by a trained animal technician for signs of clinical illness. Animals were weighed daily, and nasal swabs taken on day 2 and day 4 post-challenge to measure viral burden. Animals were euthanized on day 4 post-challenge, and lungs collected for tissue viral loads and histopathology. To assess transmission, the hamsters were co-housed 1:1 with naïve unvaccinated age-matched male hamsters for 24 hours beginning 24 hours post-challenge. Naïve animals were added to the challenged animal’s cage that was modified with a perforated aluminum barrier to physically separate the animals but allow for air exchange. Nasal swabs were taken from co-housed animals on day 2 to measure viral burden. All studies were conducted by blinded experimenters.</p>
<p id="P13">For neutralizing antibody measurements in humans, blood was collected from healthy men (n=3) and women (n=2), mean age 44, approximately 14 days after a second dose of bnt162b2 (which was approximately 21 days after their first dose of bnt162b2) under University of Calgary Conjoint Human Research Ethics Board approval REB20-0481 and informed consent. Serum was harvested and stored using a standard protocol.</p>

The cells were then cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 1% CMC for 72 hours followed by fixation and staining with crystal violet. Viral plaques were counted manually from wells containing 15-150 plaques.</p>

<title>Nasal swabs</title>
<p id="P19">A sterile polyester swab (Puritan 25-3318-U) was used to swab the nasal cavity, mouth and tongue for approximately 10 seconds. The swab was placed into 500 μL of IMDM supplemented with 2% FCS and stored in screw cap tubes at -80°C. For titering virus, nasal swabs were diluted in serum-free DMEM and then processed as described above for lung titers.</p>

<title>Lung histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P20">Four days post-challenge, hamsters were humanely euthanized, and the large right lung dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma Aldrich, HT501128) for 48 hours and then embedded into paraffin blocks using a HistoCore Pearl tissue processor (Leica Biosystems). Four μm thick formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections cut on a Thermo Shandon Finesse 325 microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mounted on SuperFrost plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. H&amp;E was performed using standard procedure. For IHC, slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to distilled water. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker on steam setting. Slides were placed in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 6.0) and boiled for 20 min at 65°C, treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and then protein blocked (Avidin Biotin Blocking Kit, ab64212). Slides were incubated in primary antibody diluted in 1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) then washed twice for three minutes in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Envision+ HRP-labeled secondary antibody was added to slide and incubated 30 min at RT and washed twice for three minutes with TBST. Slides were incubated with DAB (Agilent, GV82511-2), washed twice for three minutes with TBST, then rinsed in running tap water.</p>

<p>A booster vaccine delivered 9 months after primary bnt162b2 vaccination protects hamsters from Delta VOC infection, disease, and transmission.</p>

<title>Experimental design.</title>
<p>Hamsters were vaccinated with two doses of bnt162b2 delivered intramuscular (IM) and separated by 21 days. Serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers were monitored over 8 months by pseudovirus PRNT assay. Two hundred seventy-five days post-first dose, animals were left alone (waning immunity control) or boosted IM with bnt162b2, mRNA-1273, or AZD1222. Recall NAb response was measured on days 3 and 10 post-boost. Fifteen days post-boost (day 290), hamsters were challenged intranasally (IN) with 1e5 plaque forming units (pfu) of the Delta variant of concern (VOC). One day later, the hamsters were co-housed with naïve unvaccinated hamsters for 24 hours in cages that provided ventilated physical separation. Nasal swabs were taken from challenged animals on days 2 and 4 and from co-housed animals on day 2 to assay viral burden. Challenged animals were euthanized on day 4 and lungs harvested to assay viral load and assess lung pathology.</p>
