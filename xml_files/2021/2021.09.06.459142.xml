However, cell type-specific contributions to epigenetic dysregulation in disease are unclear as studies have often used bulk brain tissue. Therefore, methods for the deconvolution of bulk H3K27ac profiles are critical. Here we developed the Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score (CHAS), a computational tool for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. We applied CHAS to &gt; 300 H3K27ac ChIP-seq samples from studies of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder in bulk post-mortem brain tissue. In addition to recapitulating known disease-associated shifts in cellular proportions, we identified novel cell type-specific biological insights into brain disorder associated regulatory variation. In most cases, genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation targeted different cell types, thus suggesting independent mechanisms. For instance, Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk was exclusively enriched within microglia, while epigenetic dysregulation predominantly fell within oligodendrocyte-specific H3K27ac regions. In addition, reanalysis of the original datasets using CHAS enabled identification of biological pathways associated with each neurological and psychiatric disorder at cellular resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cell types</kwd><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>brain disorders</kwd><kwd>deconvolution</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">H3K27ac is a highly cell type-specific epigenetic modification that marks active enhancers and promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and can play a context-dependent, causal role in regulating gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Brain disorder risk variants predominantly fall into non-coding and regulatory regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, such as those marked by H3K27ac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Given the high cell type specificity and association with transcriptional regulation, integrating genome-wide profiles of H3K27ac from disease-relevant cell types can be useful for functional interpretation of these risk variants. This was demonstrated by efforts mapping regulatory elements to major cell types in the human cortex and investigating neurological and psychiatric disease-risk associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, H3K27ac responds to external stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, including those associated with disease. Identifying cell type-specific H3K27ac signals in brain disorders can therefore be used to infer dysregulated signalling pathways at cell type resolution.</p><p id="P3">Studies on post-mortem human brains have identified genome-wide dysregulation of histone acetylation associated with several brain disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, interpretation of these studies is limited by the use of bulk tissue, which does not account for the high cellular heterogeneity in the brain. This can lead to biological findings being driven by differences in cellular abundance rather than disease-associated changes, and limits follow-up studies in the appropriate cell types. Thus far, to control for cellular composition, studies have used approaches such as CETS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, a tool capable of quantifying neuronal proportions from DNA methylation data, and by measuring the neuronal fraction using flow cytometry. However, these methods require DNA methylation profiles for samples from the same individuals and generally only estimate the proportion of neuronal cell types versus non-neuronal cell types, rather than individual glial cell types.</p><p id="P4">Although H3K27ac profiling at the purified cell or nuclei population and single-cell level is gaining traction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, only a few studies have thus far been applied to the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, with most only characterising NeuN<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>-</sup> samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This highlights an opportunity for the development of cell type deconvolution methods to better interpret bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. Currently, only one approach has been described for the deconvolution of bulk H3K27ac profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>,</p><p id="P5">Here, we present CHAS (Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score), a novel computational tool for the cell type deconvolution of bulk brain histone acetylation profiles. To ensure robustness of our model, we implemented two independent algorithms within CHAS and compared their performance across multiple validation approaches and bulk brain histone acetylation studies. The first algorithm, referred to as CHAS, identifies cell type-specific peaks within bulk brain H3K27ac profiles and generates cell type-specific scores which can act as a proxy for cell type proportions. The second algorithm, CHAS-matrix factorisation (MF), is adapted from EPIC, a non-negative matrix factorization model originally designed for the cell type deconvolution of RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We applied both CHAS and CHAS-MF to five brain disorder H3K27ac datasets: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, Parkinson’s disease (PD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD), to detect shifts in cellular composition and re-investigate differential histone acetylation between cases and controls while controlling for cell type composition. In addition, CHAS allowed identification of cell type-specific genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation enrichments, which overall highlighted distinct cell types. Thus, CHAS enables deconvolution of H3K27ac in bulk brain tissue, yielding cell type-specific biological insights into brain disease-associated regulatory variation, and is freely available as an R package: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS">https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The CHAS model</title><sec id="S4"><label>1</label><title>CHAS</title><p id="P6">Enhancers and H3K27ac domains are known to be highly cell type specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. CHAS leverages this cell type specificity to annotate peaks identified in bulk brain studies of H3K27ac to their cell type-specific signals in neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as profiled in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although we focused on using this reference dataset so that we could perform validation, CHAS could be used with any bulk and reference datasets. CHAS achieves this by overlapping bulk brain H3K27ac peaks with each cell type specific peak set and identifying which of the bulk peaks are specific to a given cell type. For a bulk peak to be defined as cell type-specific two criteria must be met: (i) the bulk peak is annotated only to a single cell type; (ii) the bulk peak overlaps a predefined percentage of that cell type’s peak. This first step in CHAS outputs the bulk peaks annotated to each single cell type, ‘multiple’ cell types (the peak is annotated to more than one cell type), and ‘other’ (the bulk peak is not annotated to any of the reference cell types).</p><p id="P7">Analysis of bulk tissue can be difficult due to differences in cell type proportion in response to disease, or resulting from discrepancies in brain region sampling. To overcome this, using each set of cell type-specific H3K27ac peaks, CHAS generates cell type-specific scores. By averaging the normalized signal intensity of a sample across all peaks specific to a given cell type, CHAS derives a proxy of the proportion of that cell type in the given bulk sample. For sample y and cell type x, CHAS sums up the peak-normalised counts (s<sub>p,y</sub>; for peak-normalisation see Materials and Methods) across all peaks that are specific to cell type x, divided by the total number of cell type-specific peaks for cell type x. In addition, each score is also normalised by the number of cell type-specific peaks. This normalisation ensures that cell types with a greater number of specific peaks are assigned a higher CHAS score, but do not enable cross-cell type comparisons. As a constraint from peak-normalisation, the maximum signal intensity for any given peak and sample is 1 and any resulting CHAS score will always lie in the interval between 0 and 1.</p><p id="P8">Of note, given the application of CHAS to deconvolute and control for cellular heterogeneity in histone acetylation studies of brain diseases, we must work under the assumption that disease-related differences in histone acetylation are limited to only a subset of cell type-specific peaks, and that cell-type specific epigenetic variation far outweighs variation associated with disease status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We can therefore use cell type-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) H3K27ac signal intensities to act as a proxy for cell type proportion in bulk tissue data.</p><p id="P9">Briefly, CHAS requires three inputs: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="P10">bulk tissue H3K27ac peaks;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="P11">cell sorted H3K27ac reference peaks;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p id="P12">counts matrix for the bulk H3K27ac peaks.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P13">CHAS then performs two main analytical tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>): <list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="P14">Identification of cell type-specific peaks in bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles using cell sorted H3K27ac data;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="P15">Generation of cell type-specific scores on the basis of genome-wide average ChIP-seq signal intensities.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P16">The cell type annotation and generation of cell type-specific scores is implemented and freely available in our R package CHAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS">https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2</label><title>CHAS-MF</title><p id="P17">We additionally implemented a second algorithm in CHAS for estimating cell type proportions based on non-negative MF. CHAS-MF is based on the EPIC R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and uses MF to model bulk counts as the sum of cell type-specific counts multiplied by the corresponding cell proportion. CHAS-MF first identifies consensus peaks by merging bulk and reference peaks.

Higher weights are given to peaks with higher read counts and lower variability. Instead of running MF on all consensus peaks, CHAS-MF selects a set of signature peaks with cell type-specific signals. These are peaks that have high read counts specifically in one cell type with low read counts in all other cell types.</p><p id="P19">Briefly, CHAS-MF requires three inputs: <list list-type="simple" id="L3"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="P20">bulk tissue H3K27ac peaks;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="P21">cell sorted H3K27ac reference peaks;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p id="P22">either the bam files for all bulk and reference samples, or the counts matrices for the bulk and reference H3K27ac peaks.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P23">CHAS-MF then performs three main tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>): <list list-type="simple" id="L4"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="P24">Identification of consensus peaks by merging bulk and reference H3K27ac peaks;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="P25">Generation of read counts for consensus peaks in bulk and reference H3K27ac samples;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p id="P26">Prediction of cell type proportions using MFon the basis of normalised genome-wide ChIP-seq signal intensities.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Validation of CHAS</title><p id="P27">To validate the accuracy of CHAS for predicting cell type composition in bulk tissue profiles, we simulated pseudobulk H3K27ac profiles of known cell type composition using the cell sorted H3K27ac data previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Each pseudobulk sample was made up of 30 million randomly sampled reads from astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. The cellular composition was based on experimentally quantified proportions of these cell types from the cortex of 17 individuals with AD and 33 age-matched non-AD subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We performed peak calling and read count generation for these pseudobulk samples and the resultant peaks and counts were used to run CHAS. For each cell type, we observed a near-perfect correlation between the CHAS score and the true cell type proportion (Pearson’s product moment correlation, R &gt;= 0.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>-16</sup> for CHAS and R v&gt;=0.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>-16</sup> for CHAS-MF across all cell types, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). To evaluate the robustness of our approach, this process was repeated with varying read depths (20 and 10 million reads) and sample sizes (25 and 10 samples).

Briefly, Marzi et al. (2018) found widespread dysregulation of H3K27ac associated with AD, with differentially acetylated regions (DARs) identified in the vicinity of known early-onset AD risk genes, as well as genomic regions containing variants associated with late-onset AD.</p><p id="P29">In this study, we re-analysed the original data using CHAS. Out of 183,353 peaks, 80% (n = 146,144) were annotatable to one or more cell types, with 47% (n = 85,824) specific to a single cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Using CHAS-MF, we then estimated cell types proportions in each bulk sample, and found that the four cell types constituted on average 92% of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In the original study, neuronal proportion (NeuN<sup>+</sup> fraction) estimates for samples from the same individuals had been derived based on matched bulk brain DNA methylation data using CETS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, a tool for estimating neuronal proportion. CHAS-derived neuronal scores and CETS-derived neuronal proportion estimates correlated across the 47 samples (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, r = 0.409, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00429, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We next used CHAS to evaluate shifts in cellular composition in the bulk brain data, testing whether these replicate known disease-associated changes. To this end, we compared CHAS-derived scores and MF-derived proportions between AD cases and controls for each cell type. As expected, given that AD is primarily associated with neuronal loss, we observed a lower neuronal score in AD brains compared to controls (Welch's t-test, two-sided, difference in mean score = 0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The same was observed when comparing the MF-derived neuronal proportion in AD cases vs controls (Welch's t-test, two-sided, difference in mean proportion = 0.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We also report a higher oligodendrocyte score (Welch's t-test, two-sided, difference in mean score = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) but not proportion in AD cases (Welch's t-test, two-sided, difference in mean proportion = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Neither microglia score nor proportion were significantly different between AD cases and controls (Welch’s t-test, two-sided, difference in mean score = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.072; difference in mean proportion = 0.008, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We then used the cell type scores and proportions to re-investigate differential histone acetylation in AD at cell type resolution. Employing the quasi-likelihood <italic>F</italic> test in edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> we first quantified differential acetylation between AD cases and controls, while controlling for cell type scores (CHAS in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes) and age at death. 5,763 peaks were characterised by AD-associated hyperacetylation and 5,904 were characterised by AD-associated hypoacetylation (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To evaluate the likelihood of false-positive associations, we repeated the differential histone acetylation analysis using permuted AD case and control labels. Across 100 permuted datasets there was never more than one significant peak at FDR &lt; 0.05, thus making it unlikely that the results of our differential acetylation analysis based on the true AD case and control labels were detected due to chance. Differential acetylation analysis was repeated using MF-derived proportions for the four cell types and age at death as covariates. In contrast to controlling for CHAS scores, this analysis revealed a significantly lower number of AD-associated DARs to the original study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, with 324 hyper- and 792 hypo-acetylated peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Notably, AD-associated hyperacetylated regions from both analyses (controlling for CHAS scores versus proportions) were significantly enriched for oligodendrocytes when compared to regions that were not differentially acetylated (hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> = 4.33 x 10<sup>-57</sup> when controlling for scores, <italic>p</italic> = 3.25 x 10<sup>-8</sup> when controlling for proportions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). A similar enrichment of oligodendrocyte- and microglia-specific peaks was observed for AD-associated hypoacetylated regions when controlling for cell type scores (hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> = 8.87 x 10<sup>-3</sup> for oligodendrocytes; <italic>p</italic> = 2.48 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for microglia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These results are consistent with a previous study in which oligodendrocytes were reported to show the most widespread acetylation differences in the AD brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, the top AD-associated hyperacetylated peak when controlling for CHAS scores was specific to oligodendrocytes and located in the vicinity of <italic>MVB12B</italic>, a gene implicated in vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, cortical epigenetic studies have thus far failed to yield significant cell type enrichments. However, as our deconvolution of epigenetic signatures of AD highlights, genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation are not necessarily in agreement in relation to cell types. Therefore, we applied CHAS to a bulk brain H3K27ac study in PD cases and controls. Toker et al.

Out of 132,340 peaks, 74% were annotatable to at least one cell type in the PW cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Using CHAS-MF, we estimated the cell type proportion in each bulk sample, and found that the four cell types constituted on average 96% of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

While this indicates that bulk PFC tissue may be less prone to confounding disease-associated shifts in cellular proportions in PD, it simultaneously does not represent the primarily disease-affected brain region.

After filtering out peaks with low read counts, we defined an optimal peak set for each brain region: 246,300 peaks in PFC, and 236,358 peaks in cerebellum. We then used these optimal peak sets to run CHAS to evaluate cell type proportions in each brain region, and to generate cell type-specific scores and MF-derived proportions for each sample in each brain region. In the PFC, 73% of bulk peaks were annotatable to at least one cell type, whereas in the cerebellum 49% of peaks could be annotated to a cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This is most likely explained by epigenetic differences across brain regions in the reference and test datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>: brain region specific differences could exist in the epigenetic state of the same cell type, for instance microglia across multiple brain regions. Similarly, there can be differences in the actual cell types located in different brain regions. For example, the cortex contains highly specialised pyramidal neurons, while purkinje neurons are specific to the cerebellum. Using CHAS-MF, we estimated the cell type proportion in each bulk sample, and found that the four cell types constituted on average 95% of the PFC samples and 92% of the cerebellum samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Next, we compared the cell type scores and proportions in ASD cases with controls, and found no significant difference in neither the cell type scores nor the estimated proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>).

This likely relates to cellular composition differences between cortex and cerebellum, highlighting the need for a brain region appropriate reference. In contrast, deconvolution using CHAS-MF revealed a significant difference exclusively in the neuronal proportion, which might be partly due to the low abundance and high variability of the glial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>).

Encouragingly, when applied to bulk H3K27ac profiles from diverse brain disorders, CHAS scores and CHAS-MF proportions were highly correlated, with parallels in downstream analyses results. To the best of our knowledge, CHAS is the only publicly available tool for deconvolution of histone acetylation.</p><p id="P46">CHAS showed highly convincing performance on pseudobulk H3K27ac profiles of known cell type composition yielding near perfect correlations with the true underlying cellular proportions. These correlations remain stable at decreased sample sizes and at lower read depths, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Additionally, we were encouraged by the significant correlation between CHAS derived cell type scores and cell type proportions estimated using independent methods in the AD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia studies analysed here.</p><p id="P47">To illustrate the utility of CHAS for interpretation of bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles, we applied it to four epigenome-wide association studies of brain disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Deconvolution of H3K27ac profiles from the AD brain using both CHAS algorithms highlighted that differential acetylation in late stage AD is enriched for oligodendrocyte specific H3K27ac. An independent study also found the largest H3K27ac changes in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC of individuals with AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data suggest that these oligodendrocyte-specific H3K27ac changes are not limited to a single brain region and warrant further investigation of the role of oligodendrocyte H3K27ac dysregulation in AD. AD-associated hypoacetylation was also observed in microglia, which could reflect an increase in the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). In line with this, a recent study found that genetic ablation of microglial HDAC1 and HDAC2 in an AD mouse model reduced amyloid plaque burden and rescued memory deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Thus suggesting modulation of HDAC activity in microglia as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD. Whereas epigenetic variation in late-stage AD predominantly points to oligodendrocytes, genetic risk points to microglia, suggesting independent biological mechanisms. In addition, this corroborates the finding that genetic risk for AD is enriched at microglia-specific regulatory elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. SImilarly, for the ASD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia datasets, genetic risk was enriched for neuronal-specific H3K27ac, whereas epigenetic dysregulation was most strongly associated with microglia in ASD, and oligodendrocytes in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Again, the genetic risk enrichments corroborate what has previously been reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

In addition to highlighting which cell types are epigenetically dysregulated across diverse brain disorders, our analyses guide prioritisation of gene and pathway targets in these cell types. For example, the top AD DARs were oligodendrocyte-specific and annotated to genes involved in an oligodendrocyte gene network associated with AD. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of CHAS in revealing biological insights and aiding prioritisation of relevant cell types and pathways for genetic and epigenetic studies of brain disorders.</p><p id="P48">There are important caveats to consider in relation to CHAS. The power of CHAS to detect cell type-specific peaks from bulk histone acetylation profiles is inherently linked to the proportion of those cells in the bulk tissue sample. This may in turn affect the robustness and power of the downstream generation of the cell type specific score and proportions, as well as the ability to detect differential acetylation in low-frequency cell types. The inclusion of additional covariates via the cell type-specific scores or proportions can contribute to a decrease in power to detect disease-associated differences in smaller sized studies. Reassuringly, controlling for cell type proportion in moderate and large sized studies, as in the case of AD and ASD, appears to improve power to detect acetylation differences, presumably via removing noise from variation caused by cellular heterogeneity. The cell sorted data on which CHAS is based has three limitations: 1) It is only available for four major brain cell types of the cortex, excluding rarer cell types such as pericytes or endothelial cells. 2) It is limited with regard to cell subtype diversity and thus unable to distinguish between functionally and regionally distinct types of neurons. 3) It is limited with regard to different cell states. For instance, multiple microglial phenotypes have been transcriptionally and functionally characterised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–6263</sup>. Our current reference is based on a neuropathology-free, pediatric dataset in which such states – if present – are aggregated into one category. Importantly, the performance of CHAS in bulk cerebellum samples also highlights the importance of using brain-region specific reference datasets, to account for regional differences in cell types and states. At present, CHAS is limited to bulk brain studies of H3K27ac because of reference atlas availability. However, CHAS can easily be extended to other brain cell types, regions or completely distinct tissues, as well as different histone modifications, with appropriate reference datasets. Most promisingly, we hope that future availability of single cell H3K27ac profiles across brain regions will enable us to adapt CHAS to deconvolute more refined cell subtypes and states. Finally, concerns have been raised regarding the extent to which given cell deconvolution methods can appropriately account for cellular heterogeneity, particularly when a specific trait is linked to a cellular change such as neuronal loss in AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In this regard, it is reassuring that we observe enrichment of AD-associated epigenetic dysregulation in oligodendrocytes, but not neurons, which is in line with results reported by independent epigenomic and transcriptomic studies in human and mouse <sup>1464</sup>.</p><p id="P49">Going forward epigenetic studies at single cell resolution promise to create a more comprehensive picture of the epigenetic landscape associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders.

These profiles were generated using H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 500,000 nuclei from each cell type-specific population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For a given human bulk brain H3K27ac dataset, CHAS overlaps peaks detected in bulk with each cell type peak set to identify cell type-specific peaks within the bulk H3K27ac profiles. Overlaps are identified using the GenomicRanges package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Of note, no specific threshold of overlap is required for this first cell type annotation step: even if a bulk peak overlaps a purified cell type reference peak by only one base pair, it is annotated to the cell type in this first stage. To derive the cell type-specific scores, we wanted to ensure that only high-confidence and highly cell type-specific peaks are included and therefore the following two criteria must be met: (i) the bulk peak is annotated only to a single cell type; (ii) the bulk peak overlaps a predefined percentage of the given cell type peak. This predefined percentage can be specified in the <italic>CelltypeSpecificPeaks()</italic> function and is set to 50% by default and for all analyses presented in this manuscript.</p><p id="P51">For each sample, CHAS generates a cell type-specific score by averaging the normalised signal intensity across all peaks specific to a given cell type. First, read counts across peaks are converted to CPM to account for variation in library size. To further normalise the signal intensity at a given peak, for each peak p, the counts are divided by the highest observed read count for that peak, thereby placing the peak-normalised counts on a scale between 0 and 1. For a sample y and cell type x, the peak-normalised counts per million s<sub>p,y</sub> are summed up across all peaks p that are specific to cell type x, divided by the total number of cell type specific peaks for cell type x, P<sub>x</sub>. In addition, each score is also normalised by the number of cell type-specific peaks. This normalisation ensures that cell types with a greater number of specific peaks are assigned a higher CHAS score, but do not enable cross-cell type comparisons. As a constraint from peak-normalisation, the maximum signal intensity for any given peak and sample is 1 and the resulting CHAS will lie between 0 and 1 for a given sample and cell type.</p><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="EMS198761-f007"/></fig></sec><sec id="S14"><title>CHAS matrix factorization</title><p id="P52">The second algorithm implemented within CHAS employs a non-negative matrix factorization approach, which is based on the R package EPIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This approach uses matrix factorisation to model bulk counts as the sum of cell type-specific counts multiplied by the corresponding cell type proportion. The bulk count matrix is modelled as the product of the reference count matrix and the cell proportion estimation matrix. EPIC solves this equation and estimates the cell proportions using constrained least square optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="EMS198761-f008"/></fig><p id="P53">As EPIC was originally designed for transcriptomic data, we added the following steps to improve its accuracy for deconvolving bulk H3K27ac profiles. These steps are undertaken prior to running EPIC deconvolution. First, the bulk and reference H3K27ac counts are normalised based on peak length and library size to match the implicitly normalised RNA-seq counts. This is done by first dividing the raw count by the base pair length of its corresponding peak, then converting it to a CPM matrix in EdgeR. This is in direct analogy to the transcripts-per-million (TPM) normalization implemented in EPIC, modelling length and counts of H3K27ac peaks instead of transcripts (formula 2, EPIC manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P54">Second, if there are multiple reference samples for a given cell type, the median normalised CPM is used in the deconvolution. To account for signal variability within each cell type, the peaks are assigned weights for matrix factorisation. This prioritises peaks with low count variability and is derived as in the original EPIC manuscript (formula 7), using half of the range of CPM across samples as the variability metric.</p><p id="P55">Third, instead of running matrix factorisation on all consensus peaks, CHAS-MF selects a set of signature peaks with cell-type-specific signals. These are peaks that have high acetylation signals in one cell type and low signals in all the other cell types. As a threshold to qualify as signature peak, the normalised CPM for the cell type with the highest signal must be at least five times the signal from any other cell type.</p><p id="P56">The first step in CHAS-MF is merging bulk peaks and reference peaks to create consensus peaks - which are defined as the union of bulk and reference peaks. Each consensus peak is then annotated with corresponding cell types, depending on whether the consensus peak overlaps cell type-specific peaks. Read counts are generated for the consensus peaks, either from bam files or existing counts for the bulk and reference samples. Using this count data, CHAS-MF predicts the proportion of each cell type in bulk samples by applying the EPIC R package, using our histone acetylation optimized adaptations. The calculation is performed on normalised read counts for signature peaks, controlling for library size and peak lengths. If multiple reference samples are used for one cell type, the median normalised CPM will be used as the main input for matrix factorisation, and the signal variability for each peak is taken into account as a weight term in the matrix factorisation.</p><p id="P57">The cell type annotation, generation of cell type specific histone acetylation scores, and generation of MF-derived cell type proportion estimates are implemented and automated in our R package CHAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS">https://github.com/Marzi-lab/CHAS</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Validation of CHAS</title><p id="P58">We validated CHAS using three independent approaches. First, by simulating pseudobulk H3K27ac profiles of known cell type composition based on the raw sequencing data from astrocytes, microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes by Nott and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The cell type composition of each pseudobulk sample was based on proportions of astrocytes, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells in brain tissue from older individuals, which had been quantified in an independent study using immunohistochemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Based on the reported cell type proportions of 49 post-mortem brain samples we generated 49 pseudobulk samples, pooling a total of 30 million randomly sampled reads per sample from the raw H3K27ac data of the four cell types. As our reference did not include H3K27ac profiles for endothelial cells, we excluded the proportion of this cell type and instead used the relative proportions of the four other cell types. We ran CHAS and CHAS-MF to generate cell type-specific scores and cell type proportions, respectively, for each pseudobulk sample and compared these to the true cell type proportions using Pearson correlation coefficients. To additionally evaluate the robustness of CHAS with respect to sample size and sequencing depth, this process was repeated across the 49 samples with 20 million and 10 million randomly sub-sampled reads, as well as using 30 million reads in random subsets of 25 and 10 samples. Second, we used CHAS with an existing dataset of NeuN<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>-</sup> H3K27ac peaks from the anterior cingulate cortex (n=15) and dorsolateral PFC (n=14). The <italic>CelltypeSpecificPeaks()</italic> function was used to annotate each peak set, and then using the peaks that were annotatable to at least one cell type, we calculated the CHAS scores for each cell type. We then used a paired t-test to compare the average neuronal proportion across the NeuN<sup>+</sup> peaks with that of the NeuN<sup>-</sup> peaks. As the CHAS-MF workflow requires H3K27ac read counts, the associated NeuN<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>-</sup> bam files were downloaded and pre-processed in the same way as was done for the AD H3K27ac dataset (see Methods: H3K27ac in entorhinal cortex from AD cases and controls (Marzi et al. 2018)). Consensus peaks were identified using the <italic>ConsensusPeaks()</italic> function on the processed peaks and counts data. The cell typr proportion was estimated using the <italic>CelltypeProportion()</italic> function. We repeated the t-test comparing the average MF-derived neuronal proportion of NeuN<sup>+</sup> peaks with that of the NeuN<sup>-</sup> peaks. Finally, for the AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> datasets, we were able to correlate CHAS-derived neuronal and oligodendrocyte scores, respectively, with cellular proportions quantified independently in the original studies. In the AD H3K27ac study, neuronal proportions were quantified based on methylation profiles using CETS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder H3K27ac study, oligodendrocyte proportions were quantified based on acetylation profiles using dtangle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Application of CHAS to bulk brain H3K27ac datasets</title><sec id="S17"><title>H3K27ac in entorhinal cortex from AD cases and controls (Marzi et al. 2018)</title><p id="P59">In order to demonstrate reproducibility and undertake preprocessing using updated versions of software and the most recent reference genome, raw ChIP-seq data from our previous study was downloaded from sequence read archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNCA297982<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We performed basic quality control using fastQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Using bowtie2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> the fastq files were aligned to the most recent human reference genome (GRCh38)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. The resulting SAM files were converted to binary (BAM) format using SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Duplicates, unmapped reads, and reads with a sequence quality score q &lt; 30 were removed from all BAM files and the filtered BAM files were subsequently merged into one grouped file. Next, using MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> we performed peak calling on the merged file of all samples. The following peak sets were subsequently filtered out: 1) peaks which overlapped the ENCODE blacklist peaks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist">https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist</ext-link>), 2) peaks which were located in unmapped contigs or mitochondrial DNA, and 3) peaks which did not meet a significance threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup> for peak calling. Read count generation for each sample was performed using featureCounts70 and read counts were converted to and stored in a CPM matrix, keeping peaks with a minimum of three samples showing ≥ 1 read per million. This resulted in a total of 183,353 peaks to be used in downstream analyses. This optimal peak set and CPM matrix were used as input to run CHAS to identify cell type-specific peaks in the bulk H3K27ac profiles and to generate cell type-specific H3K27ac scores as a proxy for the proportion of each cell type in the bulk peak set. Of note, to annotate cell types to each bulk peak and to calculate the cell type proportions across the bulk peaks, we only required an overlap of at least one base pair between the bulk peak and the cell type peak. However, for peaks included in the cell type specific histone acetylation score we required a more stringent overlap of at least 50% of the cell type peak interval. We also ran CHAS-MF on the processed peaks and counts along with the BAM files to estimate the proportions of each cell type in the bulk samples. The CHAS-generated cell type-specific scores and CHAS-MF-derived proportions were used to detect shifts in cellular composition between AD cases and controls, by comparing the means using a Welch's t-test. Differences in histone acetylation between AD cases and controls were analysed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, but including the CHAS derived cell type scores or MF proportions, instead of the neuronal proportion estimator based on CETS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Briefly, the quasi-likelihood F test in the Bioconductor package edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> was used to test for differences in histone acetylation between AD cases and controls, while controlling for: (i) age at death and cell type-specific scores for the four brain cell types; (ii) age at death and cell type proportions. All covariates were treated as continuous numeric variables. Peaks were considered differentially acetylated at FDR&lt;0.05. To additionally confirm that we had adequately controlled for false-positive associations, we permuted the AD case and control labels 100 times and repeated the differential histone acetylation analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>H3K27ac in PFC from PD cases and controls: Toker et al. 2021</title><p id="P60">Peak lists and read count tables for the Park West (PW) cohort were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ltoker/ChIPseqPD">https://github.com/ltoker/ChIPseqPD</ext-link>.

For the PW cohort, a total of 171,285 peaks were used for downstream analyses. From the counts tables we excluded the sample outliers identified in Toker et al (2021) and performed final filtering, keeping peaks with a minimum of three samples showing ≥ 1 read per million for the differential histone acetylation analysis. This left us with 152,823 peaks in the PW cohort. The counts table along with the filtered peak set were used as input to CHAS and CHAS-MF, as previously described for the AD dataset. As there were no BAM files available for the PD study, we performed CHAS-MF using the original counts for the bulk and reference peaks as a proxy for the read counts for consensus peaks.

1</label><caption><title>CHAS workflow.</title><p>CHAS is split into two main computational workflows: CHAS and CHAS-MF. The first step in CHAS is the identification of cell type-specific peaks in bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles, which is achieved using publicly available brain cell sorted H3K27ac data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Using the cell type-specific peaks identified in step 1 and a CPM matrix derived using the bulk tissue H3K27ac data, CHAS generates cell type-specific scores for each sample. Note, for a bulk tissue peak to be defined as cell type-specific, it can only be annotated to a single cell type and it must overlap <italic>n</italic>% of that cell type’s peak(s). The specific required percentage overlap (<italic>n</italic>) can be specified as input to CHAS. The first step in CHAS-MF is merging bulk peaks and reference peaks to create consensus peaks. Each consensus peak is then annotated with corresponding cell types, depending on whether the consensus peak contains cell type-specific peaks. Read counts are then generated for the consensus peaks, either from bam files or existing counts for the bulk and reference samples. Using this count data, CHAS-MF predicts the proportion of each cell type in bulk samples by using EPIC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The calculation is performed on normalised read counts, controlling for library size and peak length. If multiple reference samples are used for one cell type, the median value will be used as the main input for MF, and the signal variability for each peak is taken into account as weight in MF. The CHAS-derived cell type scores and MF-derived cell type proportions can be correlated, and both can be used as covariates in downstream analyses.</p><p><italic>CHASx, y</italic>: cell type-specific score for cell type x, sample y; P<italic>x</italic>: set of cell type-specific peaks for cell type x; S<italic>p, y</italic>: standardised peak signal intensity for peak p, sample y. q<italic>x</italic>: normalisation factor for cell type x.
