Epigenetic processes have been proposed as a possible mechanism for mediating these phenotypic differences. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing of queens, males and reproductive female workers we have characterised the sex- and caste-specific methylome of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We have identified a potential role for DNA methylation in histone modification processes which may influence sex and caste phenotypic differences. We also find differentially methylated genes generally show low levels of DNA methylation which may suggest a separate function for lowly methylated genes in mediating transcriptional plasticity. Unlike highly methylated genes which are usually involved in housekeeping functions. We also examined the relationship between the underlying genome and the methylome using whole genome re-sequencing of the same queens and males. We find DNA methylation is enriched at zero-fold degenerate sites. We suggest DNA methylation may be acting as a mutagen at these sites thereby providing substrate for selection via changes in gene transcription mediated by the underlying genotype. However, we did not see any relationship between DNA methylation and rates of positive selection in our samples. In order to fully assess a possible role for DNA methylation in adaptive processes a specifically designed study using natural population data is needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>social insect</kwd><kwd>bumblebee</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>degeneracy</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In many organisms, the generation of sexual dimorphic traits is mediated via genetically different sex chromosomes. In mammals, this consists of the classic XY systems and in birds, the heterogametic sex is switched, displaying a ZW system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dean and Mank, 2014</xref>). However, the diversity of sex determination systems in insects is considerably more varied. Some species display a X0 system where two X chromosomes are present in females and only one in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pal and Vicoso, 2015</xref>). Others lack sex chromosomes completely, for example the mealybug, <italic>Planococcus citri</italic>, has a paternal genome elimination system where one whole set of chromosomes is highly condensed in males but not females. A similar system is found in Hymenoptera, haplodiploidy, here males have only a maternally derived haploid genome, generated from an unfertilised egg, whereas females are sexually produced diploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Normark, 2003</xref>). These systems are even more complex in the social Hymenoptera which also display phenotypically different castes of a single sex. The repertoire of molecular mechanisms which allow these species to generate phenotypically different sexes and castes from a single genome remain unknown.</p><p id="P3">Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as a possible method for caste determination in multiple social insect species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Sieber <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The majority of research in this area has focused on DNA methylation, which is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide. Insect DNA methylation, like mammalian DNA methylation, is generally found in a CpG context (referring to a cytosine base immediately followed by a guanine base) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Glastad <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). It is found at lower levels, with &lt;1% - 14% of CpGs being methylated, compared to mammals where around 70% of CpG sites are methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bewick <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Feng <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Additionally DNA methylation in insects is generally located in gene bodies and associated with more highly expressed genes, such as housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Provataris <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Elango <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Foret <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The function of DNA methylation in insects is largely unknown and thought to be variable based on the range of overall levels between taxonomic orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Provataris <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In Hymenoptera, DNA methylation has been associated with caste differences in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lyko <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bonasio <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amarasinghe <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Glastad <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). However, a casual link has yet to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Oldroyd and Yagound, 2021</xref>). Although no association between the level of sociality of a species and the level of DNA methylation has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Weiner <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Glastad <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Many of the studies exploring a role for DNA methylation in the generation of different phenotypes in social insects have focused on single-sex caste differences, although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Glastad <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>). However, recently DNA methylation has been strongly implicated in the generation of sex differences in some hemipteran bugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bain <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mathers <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), with other related species showing minimum sex-specific DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This highlights the importance of assessing individual species rather than relying on observations of related species.</p><p id="P5">Previous work in Hymenoptera has also highlighted a role for the underlying genome in determining DNA methylation profiles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (2016</xref>) found DNA methylation profiles of alleles in offspring from hybrid crosses of the parasitic wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> were almost identical to the methylation profile of the parentâs allele. It has also been shown in honeybees that genes which are more variable in terms of DNA methylation show increased genetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yagound <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and that DNA methylation marks are heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yagound <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). These studies clearly suggest a link between the epigenome and genome in these species. However, the functional importance of genetically determined DNA methylation remains unknown.</p><p id="P6">The bumblebee, <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>, provides an ideal system to assess a potential role for DNA methylation in the generation of sex- and caste-specific phenotypes, in addition to exploring the relationship between the methylome and genome. <italic>B. terrestris</italic> is an important pollinator species both economically and ecologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Woodard <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). It displays primitive eusociality with colonies consisting of a single female queen, mated by a single male, and female worker daughters. Exhibiting haplodiploidy, male <italic>B. terrestris</italic> are haploid and female queens and workers and diploid. Importantly, genome-wide DNA methylation differences have been found between sterile and reproductive phenotypes of <italic>B. terrestris</italic> workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marshall <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), with experimental manipulation of DNA methylation resulting in a change in worker phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amarasinghe <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). This suggests a functional role for DNA methylation in the generation of phenotypic differences between genetically similar individuals within this species. However, the extent to which DNA methylation differs between sexes and female castes of <italic>B. terrestris</italic> remains unknown. Additionally, previous research has shown colony-specific profiles of DNA methylation in <italic>B. terrestris,</italic> indicating a potential role for genotype-driven DNA methylation profiles in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marshall <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In order to determine DNA methylation differences between sexes and castes of <italic>B. terrestris</italic> we have generated whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) libraries of males, queens and reproductive workers.

We find almost all genes classed as differentially methylated in this study do indeed show low levels of DNA methylation (&gt;0 and &lt;0.3) in all three castes, with a few showing medium levels (&gt;=0.3 and &lt;0.7) and none being classed as highly methylated genes in any sex/caste (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig.S2</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We carried out a GO enrichment analysis on all differentially methylated genes and on hypermethylated genes for each sex/caste per comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary 1.0.6</xref>).

Multiple histone related terms and reproductive terms were also found for differentially methylated genes between males and queens, as well as the above we also found â<italic>histone H4-K20 demethylation</italic>â (GO:0035574), â<italic>histone H3-K27 acetylation</italic>â (GO:0043974), â<italic>histone H3-K27 demethylation</italic>â (GO:0071557) and â<italic>positive regulation of histone H3-K9 trimethylation</italic>â (GO:1900114). When looking specifically at hypermethylated genes per sex/caste compared to all differentially methylated genes per comparison we find various regulatory terms throughout, including terms involved in hormone regulation enriched in male hypermethylated genes compared to queens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary 1.0.6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Around 66% of all differentially methylated genes occur uniquely between comparisons, with 69/205 (~ 33%) genes occurring in multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>).

We carried out a GO enrichment on these genes using all differentially methylated genes from all comparisons as a background set. We find general cellular processes enriched in both gene lists with hypermethylated genes in the males compared to the female castes also enriched for hormone regulatory processes (e.g. â<italic>regulation of hormone levels</italic>â (GO:0010817) and â<italic>hormone secretion</italic>â (GO:0046879)).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Relationship between the genome and the methylome</title><p id="P25">Recent research has indicated that the underlying genome may play a role in the establishment of DNA methylation profiles in various insect species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yagound <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), including <italic>B. terrestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marshall <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, the function of gene-body DNA methylation in insects remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Provataris <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). It has been suggested that DNA methylation induced by the environment may either be a direct substrate for selection or itself induce genetic variation (via the deamination of cytosines to thymines), creating phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Skinner and Nilsson, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To explore the relationship between the genome and methylome in this context, we used whole genome re-sequencing data from the males and queens to see if DNA methylation appears to be directly associated with the underlying genome. We determined the proportion of zero-fold and four-fold degenerate sites which are classed as methylated (via the binomial test described above) to see if DNA methylation is enriched at sites which may be subject to selection (zero-fold sites, which always result in an amino acid change when there is a polymorphism) compared to sites protected from selection (four-fold sites, for which any polymorphism would result in the same amino acid).</p><p id="P27">We find that a higher proportion of zero-fold degenerate sites are methylated compared to two-, three- and four-fold sites (linear model, <italic>F</italic><sub>7,24</sub> = 8.426, <italic>t</italic> = 21.862, <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), with queens showing a higher proportion of methylated sites across all degeneracy-levels compared to males (linear model, <italic>F</italic><sub>7,24</sub> = 8.426, <italic>t</italic> = 2.337, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Itâs worth noting that the zero-fold degenerate sites are only found in codon positions one and two, and so by association these positions have a higher proportion of methylated sites compared to the third codon position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary 1.0.7</xref>). We also had enough alleles in our study (n = 12, four diploid queens and four haploid males) to carry out a pN/pS analysis to look for signatures of selection across the genome. We do not find any association with male or female levels of DNA methylation and potential selective pressure (linear model, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,15330</sub> = 1.449, <italic>t</italic> = -1.204, <italic>P</italic> = 0.228, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">In this study we have explored the sex- and caste-specific DNA methylation profiles of <italic>B. terrestris</italic> and examined the relationship between the methylome and underlying genome. We find that sexes and castes show similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, with more variability in males. We also find there are a number of genes which are differentially methylated between sexes and castes, mostly between males and the female castes, involved in the regulation of histone modifications and reproductive-related processes. These differentially methylated genes show low levels of DNA methylation generally in all castes. Finally, we find that DNA methylation is enriched at sites exposed to selection in <italic>B. terrestris</italic>, i.e. zero-fold degenerate sites. However, we did not find an association between DNA methylation and genes potentially under selection.</p><p id="P29">Genome-wide we found that males show similar DNA methylation profiles to the two female castes, in terms of DNA methylation localisation to exons and depletion in promoter regions, we also found a number of differentially methylated genes between males and females. Specifically, differentially methylated genes are enriched for many histone modification related processes. It has recently been found in the silk moth that the presence of DNA methylation promotes histone H3-K27 acetylation which changes the chromatin formation of a region allowing changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The relationship between DNA methylation and histone modifications in social insects remains unknown. However, recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Choppin <italic>et al</italic>. (2021</xref>) shows a role for histone acetylation in the regulation of worker reproduction and gene expression in the ant <italic>Temnothorax rugatulus</italic>. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon and Matz (2022</xref>) find gene-body methylation across a variety of invertebrates, including <italic>B. terrestris</italic> is not sufficient to fully explain changes in gene transcription, they also suggest a more complex regulatory mechanism may be in play involving other epigenetic modifications. An exploration of the functional relationship between DNA methylation and histone modifications is needed across a greater diversity of insect species in order to understand how these processes may interact to produce downstream gene expression and thus phenotypic differences.</p><p id="P30">We also find differentially methylated genes between queens and reproductive workers are involved in reproductive related processes. Previous work has suggested a role for DNA methylation in reproduction in <italic>B. terrestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amarasinghe <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), as well as other social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bonasio <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), although this does not appear to be consistent across Hymenoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Libbrecht <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Patalano <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Whilst the differentially methylated genes identified here suggest a role for DNA methylation in maintaining or generating sex and caste differences, a direct causal link between DNA methylation and the gene expression changes mediating phenotypes has yet to be found. The development of CRISPR-Cas9 DNA methylation editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Vojta <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) in <italic>B. terrestris</italic> would allow for studies into the causal consequences of gene methylation.</p><p id="P31">Whilst the function of gene-body DNA methylation remains unknown, higher levels have been associated with stable gene expression of housekeeping genes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Provataris <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Reciprocally, previous work suggested that low methylation of genes allows for more variation in gene expression levels increasing phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Roberts and Gavery, 2012</xref>). We find evidence in support of this idea in that all of the genes found to be differentially methylated between castes and sexes show overall low levels of DNA methylation, with no highly methylated genes differentially expressed. However, it is worth noting that there are proportionally more lowly methylated genes in this species compared to highly methylated genes which may also account for this trend. In addition, whilst the differential DNA methylation analysis done here is particularly stringent for this field, requiring a percentage difference in DNA methylation levels will allow for more lowly methylated genes to be identified, compared to highly methylated genes which would require overall greater differences in DNA methylation to meet the 15% threshold. Nevertheless, there is some mixed evidence across invertebrates that suggests lowly methylated genes respond to environmental changes as a group by increasing methylation levels and thus decreasing transcriptional levels, with the opposite occurring for highly methylated genes, providing transcriptional plasticity, known as the âseesawâ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon and Matz, 2022</xref>). A re-analysis of reproductive and sterile bumblebee worker WGBS data as part of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon and Matz (2022</xref>), found some support for this theory. A study specifically addressing this idea, which is able to disentangle tissue-specific profiles is needed.</p><p id="P32">We next assessed the relationship between the underlying genome and the methylome. As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon and Matz (2022</xref>), gene-body DNA methylation does not appear to directly regulate gene expression in invertebrates. However, recent papers have suggested a role for DNA methylation in species evolution, whereby environmentally induced DNA methylation is directly heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Skinner and Nilsson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Harney <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and may produce adaptive phenotypes. Multiple studies in arthropods have indeed demonstrated heritability of DNA methylation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yagound <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) including environmentally induced DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Harney <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Given that DNA methylation has also been shown to be linked to the underlying genotype in various insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marshall <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yagound <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) we predicted that it may be enriched in certain codon positions in order to provide substrate for selection, not through directly altering gene expression levels but through its mutagenic effect on the underlying genome, which may then cause transcriptional variation.</p><p id="P33">In order to begin to explore this idea in <italic>B. terrestris</italic>, we examined the relationship between DNA methylation and codon degeneracy. We found a higher proportion of zero-fold degenerate sites (those exposed to selection) are methylated compared to two-fold, three-fold and four-fold sites. This trend is also observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chuang and Chen, 2014</xref>). Given that the presence of DNA methylation has been shown, in humans, to increase mutation rates by over ten-fold compared to background genomic rates via the spontaneous deamination of cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sved and Bird, 1990</xref>), we believe this finding provides some preliminary support for the idea of DNA methylation influencing gene expression changes via the underlying genome. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chuang and Chen (2014</xref>) argue that enrichment of DNA methylation at zero-fold degenerate sites is not to act as a mutagen for such sites but rather to serve as a stabilising factor for these sites. Given that we find genes with high levels of gene-body DNA methylation are involved in housekeeping functions and stable gene expression, this would support this idea. As mentioned above, however, there is now a thought that there are two classes of methylated genes, those highly methylated with housekeeping functions and those lowly methylated which may be more plastic.</p><p id="P34">Finally, we did not find any relationship between DNA methylation levels of a gene and the pN/pS ratio. This may be due to a number of reasons. Firstly, there may simply be no relationship between DNA methylation and rates of positive selection in <italic>B. terrestris</italic>, countering the idea that DNA methylation is providing substrate for selection. Secondly, the samples used in this study are from commercial colonies and as such may not be under any particular environmental pressures driving selection. Exploring this relationship in natural populations would provide a better indicator for a potential role of DNA methylation in adaptive processes. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Park <italic>et al</italic>. (2011</xref>) found the proxy for DNA methylation (CpG observed / expected density) was negatively correlated with rates of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions between species of the parasitic wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Again, this supports the idea that methylation is present in constrained genes, potentially acting as a stabilising factor. However, as mentioned above this needs to be assessed fully in terms of highly methylated and lowly methylated genes rather than on a genome-wide scale in order to fully understand this relationship.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">We have characterised the sex- and caste-specific methylome of <italic>B. terrestris</italic> identifying a potential role for DNA methylation in downstream epigenetic regulatory processes which may influence sex and caste phenotypic differences. These results are correlational but can direct future experimental manipulation of DNA methylation profiles at specific genes. We also find that differentially methylated genes are those showing low overall levels, this may be due to the nature of the statistical analysis used to identify differential DNA methylation or it could suggest a function for low-levels of DNA methylation in mediating plasticity of gene expression. We also find that DNA methylation is enriched at zero-fold degenerate sites and suggest this may be explained by DNA methylation functioning as a mutagen at these sites to provide substrate for selection via changes in gene transcription mediated by the underlying genotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS154607-supplement-Supplementary_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d97aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS154607-supplement-Supplementary_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d97aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their helpful feedback on earlier versions of this manuscript.
