Therefore, the development of microtubule (MT) inhibitors is considered a promising route to anticancer agents. Our approach to identify novel scaffolds as MT inhibitors depends on a 3D-structure-based pharmacophore approach and docking using three programs MOE, Autodock and BUDE (Bristol University Docking Engine) to screen a library of virtual compounds. From this work we identified the compound 7-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-6,7-dihydro-3H-imidazo[4,5-b] pyridin-5-ol <bold>(6)</bold> as a novel inhibitor scaffold. This compound inhibited several types of cancer cell proliferation at low micromolar concentrations with low toxicity. Compound <bold>6</bold> caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and blocked tubulin polymerization at low micromolar concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.1 ±0.1 μM), inducing apoptosis via activation of caspase 9, increasing the level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreasing the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. In summary, our approach identified a lead compound with potential antimitotic and antiproliferative activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Abstract figure</title><p id="P2"><fig id="F10" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="EMS144882-f010"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Microtubules (MTs) consist of α/β tubulin heterodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and are ubiquitous in all eukaryotic cells being the key component of the cytoskeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> They play a critical role in many cellular processes, including cell division in which they assemble to make up the mitotic spindle required for segregation of the chromosomes to the spindle poles and consequent daughter cells; cell proliferation, maintenance of cell shape and signal transduction; and MT-motor proteins that transport diverse cellular cargoes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> MTs are characterized by their highly dynamic behaviour, as they switch between periods of elongation and shortening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Targeting the process of microtubule dynamics is an excellent strategy for chemotherapy and modulation of MT dynamics is considered to be one of the most successful approaches in the treatment of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Microtubule-targeting agents are classified into microtubule destabilizers and microtubule stabilizers according to the mechanism by which they affect microtubule dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> There are four major ligand binding sites identified on the microtubule namely: the vinca and colchicine sites where ligand binding induces microtubule destabilization and the taxane and peloruside /laulimalide sites where binding typically induces microtubule stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and colchicine all showed potent inhibition of cancer cell lines. However, colchicine showed limitations as an antitumor agent in clinical trials due to its narrow therapeutic window.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> While vinca alkaloids and taxanes are effective, they are also complex natural products that are difficult to synthesize and generally show poor bioavailability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> In addition, the emergence of resistance to these drugs has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Research has focussed on developing novel colchicine site inhibitors (CSI), since the molecular structure of known colchicine-site inhibitors is less complex than that of taxanes and vinca alkaloids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> However, microtubule-destabilizing agents that bind at the colchicine-binding site and reach clinical trials had significant side effects, for example ZD6126 is a phosphate prodrug of N-acetylcolchinol (NAC) releasing the drug after administration and <italic>in-vivo</italic> hydrolysis. NAC binds to the colchicine binding site and inhibits tubulin polymerization, reducing the proliferating immature endothelial cells that line the tumour blood vessels and consequently inducing tumour cell death. ZD6126 reached phase II trials for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and induced necrosis in the tumours causing a large reduction in tumour cell yield after a single dose of ZD6126 but due to its cardiotoxicity, was withdrawn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Similarly, ABT-751 showed antitumor activities against a broad spectrum of cancers including those resistant to conventional chemotherapies. ABT-751 is an anti-tubulin agent with anti-vascular properties that is responsible for the dysfunction of tumour blood vessels. Despite administration of a single dose of ABT-751 (30 mg/kg, intravenously) disrupting tumour neovascularisation, it was withdrawn from Phase II due to adverse side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Despite the great potential of combretastatin and its prodrugs, CA1P and CA4P, these also suffer from drawbacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> As such, there remains an urgent need to design and discover novel MTs inhibitors based on the colchicine site of β-tubulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, our objective is to identify a novel chemical scaffold to bind the colchicine site that may form the basis of a new lead compound which offers promising antimitotic and antiproliferative activity as well as is well-tolerated. Here we have used structure-based pharmacophore virtual screening of a subset of the ZINC15 database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> This computational approach represents a quick and efficient method in the identification of novel and diverse scaffolds of CSI.

This process afforded 2476 compounds matching at least 4 points of the pharmacophore.

MOE and Autodock4.2 are used widely in computational studies, BUDE is an in-house docking program using an empirical free energy forcefield to predict ligand affinities and has been used for inhibitor discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, The predicted binding affinities of colchicine using BUDE, MOE, and AutoDock4.2 (-100.27 kJ/mol, -5.1 kcal/mol and -9.52 kcal/mol) respectively, were used as a cut-off for selecting potential hits. The numbers of compounds passing this filter with a binding score better than colchicine were 188, 107, and 226 respectively. Next, we applied the criterion that compounds must be common to two or three of these docked sets.

Firstly, 7-feature pharmacophore matching was used to filter out some 98 % of compounds from a library of 100,000 available compounds. Consensus docking of these 2746 matched compounds was performed using three different methods (MOE, BUDE and Autodock) and passed 99 compounds. Cheminformatics was used to remove compounds with toxicological risk and to cluster compounds by similarity. A total of 13 compounds were chosen from the clustering for experimental investigation. The antiproliferative activities of the 13 compounds were evaluated against three cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-231, and A549) and four compounds (<bold>6, 8, 9</bold> and <bold>13</bold>) showed significant results. Compounds <bold>6,8</bold> and <bold>9</bold> had IC<sub>50</sub> values ≤ 20 μM and these three compounds disrupted spindles in the mitotic cells giving a phenotype similar to colchicine. Compounds <bold>6,8</bold> and <bold>9</bold> modulated tubulin polymerisation in vitro and in three cancer cell lines with minimal toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations into the microsecond regime support the predicted binding modes. Compound <bold>6</bold> showed the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (6.1±0.1 μM) inhibiting tubulin polymerization in MCF-7 cells using ELISA. FACS cell cycle analysis showed that <bold>6</bold> arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induces late apoptosis via upregulating caspase-9 and Bax while downregulating Bcl2. The activity of <bold>6</bold> against cancer cells, its low cytotoxicity to normal fibroblasts and ease of synthesis of variants provides a start-point for medicinal chemistry development. The results of docking and simulation of <bold>6</bold> were used to suggest elaborations to exploit the deep-binding site in the colchicine pocket and the persistence of binding of these derivatives (<bold>14</bold> and <bold>15</bold>) was demonstrated by further molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed synthetic route should facilitate production of a large number of derivatives based on the imidazopyridine scaffold of <bold>6</bold> to explore SAR and improve the drug-likeness of this series.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S19"><title>Chemistry</title><p id="P22"><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer at 500 MHz.

A 3D structure-based pharmacophore was constructed from the tubulin-colchicine complex (1SA0) using the Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints (PLIF) application implemented in MOE.
