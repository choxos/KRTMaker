Here, we show that <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated degradation of mRNAs leads to an accumulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) relative to linear mRNAs during HSV-1 infection. Strikingly, we found that circular splicing of the long isoform (NEAT1_2) of the nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) was massively induced during HSV-1 infection. In contrast to other circRNAs, induction of the NEAT1_2 circRNA was independent of <italic>vhs</italic> and occurred while NEAT1_2 was still bound to the chromatin. This was associated with induction of linear splicing of NEAT1_2 both within and downstream of the circRNA. NEAT1_2 splicing was absent in uninfected cells but can be induced by ectopic co-expression of the HSV-1 immediate-early proteins ICP22 and ICP27. Interestingly, NEAT1_2 circular and linear splicing was also up-regulated in influenza A virus (IAV) infection but absent in stress conditions, which disrupt transcription termination similar to but not by the same mechanisms as HSV-1 and IAV infection. Large-scale analysis of published RNA-seq data uncovered induction of NEAT1_2 splicing in cancer cells upon inhibition or knockdown of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) or the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex phosphorylated by CDK7. Finally, CDK7 inhibition also disrupted transcription termination, highlighting a possible link between disruption of transcription termination and NEAT1_2 splicing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is one of nine herpesviruses known to infect humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It is most commonly known for causing cold sores but can also result in life-threatening diseases. A key role in HSV-1 lytic infections is played by the virion host shut-off (<italic>vhs</italic>) protein, which is delivered to the infected cell by the incoming virus particles and rapidly starts cleaving both cellular and viral mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. <italic>Vhs</italic> target recognition occurs during translation initiation and requires binding of <italic>vhs</italic> to components of the cap-binding complex eIF4F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. <italic>Vhs</italic> can also cleave circular RNAs (circRNAs), but only if they contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. CircRNAs form closed RNA-loops and are naturally generated during the splicing process either by “back-splicing” of exons out of their linear order (resulting in non-colinear 3’–5’ junctions) or stabilization of intron lariats with 2’–5’ junctions joining the 5’ and branchpoint nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Previously considered to occur only rarely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], recent large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies revealed the existence of thousands of circRNAs in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Due to the absence of a 5’ cap or poly(A) tail and their resistance to exonucleases, circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. While a function as miRNA sponge has been reported for a small number of circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], this is now nevertheless thought to be rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Other functions reported for individual circRNAs involve regulation of transcription, alternative splicing and translation and some may even serve as templates for protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. However, for most circRNAs their function remains elusive.</p><p id="P3">Recently, Shi <italic>et al</italic>. reported on dysregulation of circRNAs during HSV-1 infection, with 188 circRNAs being significantly up-regulated at 48 h post infection (p.i.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Considering the specific targeting of <italic>vhs</italic> to translated mRNAs, we hypothesized that up-regulation of circRNAs may simply be a consequence of circRNAs escaping <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated RNA decay. We previously performed 4-thiouridine-(4sU)-tagging followed by sequencing (4sU-seq) to characterize <italic>de novo</italic> transcription in hourly intervals during the first 8 h of lytic wild-type (WT) HSV-1 strain 17 infection of primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) and combined this with total RNA-seq in two-hourly steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig a</xref>, n=2 replicates). More recently, we applied the same experimental set-up to Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection to study <italic>vhs</italic>-dependent gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig a</xref>). In this study, we explore these data to show a general accumulation of circRNAs in a <italic>vhs</italic>-dependent manner during HSV-1 infection.</p><p id="P4">Strikingly, this analysis also revealed induction of both circular and novel linear splicing of the long non-coding (linc)RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) during HSV-1 infection. In contrast to other circRNAs, this induction was independent of <italic>vhs</italic>. The nuclear lincRNA NEAT1 is one of the most highly expressed lincRNAs and has two isoforms with identical 5’ but distinct 3’ ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>): A short transcript (NEAT1_1, also denoted as MENε, ~3.7nt), stabilized by a poly(A) tail and expressed in a wide range of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and a long transcript (NEAT1_2, also denoted as MENβ, ~22.7 nt), stabilized by a triple helical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] but with more limited expression in particular cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The HSV-1-induced circRNA is generated from the 3’ region unique to the NEAT1_2 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). NEAT1_2 is essential for the structure of paraspeckles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], nuclear bodies located in the interchromatin space. NEAT1_2 forms a scaffold for paraspeckles by being bound by a number of proteins with functions in transcription and/or RNA processing and splicing (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]). Paraspeckles impact gene expression by nuclear retention of adenosine-to-inosine-edited mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In viral infection, NEAT1_2 plays a role in interleukin 8 (IL-8) induction by sequestering the IL-8 repressor splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) to paraspeckles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. NEAT1 is up-regulated in HIV-1, dengue, HSV-1, Hantavirus, Hepatitis D and influenza infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Expression levels of NEAT1_2 have been shown to be positively correlated with presence of paraspeckles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and HSV-1 infection induces paraspeckle formation, likely through up-regulation of NEAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The HSV-1 immediate-early proteins ICP27 and ICP22 are both known to interact with the host transcription and RNA processing machinery. ICP27 regulates splicing and polyadenylation by interacting with splicing factors and the mRNA 3’ processing factor CPSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that ICP27 is sufficient but not necessary for disruption of transcription termination in HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. ICP22 represses RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription elongation by interacting with elongation factors, such as the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and the FACT complex, and inhibits phosphorylation of the Pol II carboxyterminal domain (CTD) at Ser2 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Ser2 phosphorylation plays a key role in recruiting splicing and termination factors to Pol II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that ICP27 and/or ICP22 may play a role in induction of NEAT1_2 splicing. Indeed, we could show that combined ectopic expression of ICP27 and ICP22 is sufficient to induce both circular and linear splicing of NEAT1_2.</p><p id="P6">HSV-1 and influenza A (IAV) infection as well as cellular stresses disrupt transcription termination, leading to read-through transcription beyond poly(A) sites for tens-of-thousands of nucleotides for many but not all cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Strikingly, IAV infection, but not salt and heat stress, also induces NEAT1_2 circular and linear splicing. Moreover, selective inhibition and knockdown of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as well as knockdown of its phosphorylation target the MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] induce both NEAT1_2 splicing and read-through transcription in cancer cell lines. This highlights a possible link between read-through transcription and NEAT1_2 splicing and a potential role of CDK7 in HSV-1 or IAV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Vhs-dependent accumulation of circRNAs in HSV-1 infection</title><p id="P7">CircRNA detection from RNA-seq reads is based on identifying junction reads connecting a donor splice site of a downstream exon to the acceptor splice site of an upstream exon. Several algorithms for circRNA <italic>de novo</italic> detection are available, but due to high false positive rates combination of at least two algorithms is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We thus employed a pipeline combining circRNA_finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] and CIRI2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] for circRNA <italic>de novo</italic> detection (see methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig b</xref>) and analyzed only circRNAs that were independently discovered by both algorithms. We applied this pipeline on our total RNA-seq and 4sU-seq time-courses for the first 8 h of lytic wild-type (WT) and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig a</xref>). This identified a total of 16,463 circRNAs in the WT time-course and 7,306 in the Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection time-course. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] and the high stability of circRNAs, only a small number of circRNAs were detected in 4sU-RNA (119 and 194 in at least one sample of WT and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> 4sU-seq, respectively). Most circRNAs (&gt;97%) were only detected in total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig a,b</xref>). Almost all of the identified circRNAs (82.6% and 92.7% for the WT and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection time-courses, respectively) were already annotated in circBase, a database of circRNAs identified in large-scale RNA-seq studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Strikingly, in total RNA a substantially larger number of circRNAs was identified for WT infection than for mock and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). Since the number of reads mapping to the host genome in total RNA was comparable or higher in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection than in WT infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig b</xref>), the lower number of circRNAs identified in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection is not due to lower sequencing depth. To evaluate abundance of individual circRNAs, circRNA read counts were normalized to the total number of reads mapping to (linear) exon-exon junctions of host protein-coding genes and then averaged between replicates. We used this normalization since the fraction of (linearly) spliced host reads decreased considerably during WT infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig c</xref>). This is largely a consequence of HSV-1-induced read-through transcription. Read-through transcripts are rarely spliced downstream of the poly(A) site and are retained in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], thus escaping <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated decay. In <italic>vhs</italic> infection, the fraction of spliced reads did not decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig d</xref>) due to reduced read-through transcription and absence of <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated decay of cytosolic mRNAs. Normalized circRNA counts increased substantially with increasing duration of WT infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3 Fig a-c</xref>, red line = linear regression estimate over all circRNAs). By 8 h p.i. WT infection, circRNAs were ~6.5-fold increased in total RNA compared to uninfected cells. In contrast, Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection exhibited only a very modest ~1.3-fold increase in circRNAs by 8 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3 Fig d-f</xref>), which can likely be attributed to the global loss of host transcriptional activity in HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Since circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs, they can consequently accumulate relative to linear RNAs even in absence of <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated decay. Notably, if we normalize by the total numbers of reads mapped to the host, we also observe increased accumulation of circRNAs in WT infection compared to Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection, albeit to a lower degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P9">One factor that might negatively impact circRNA detection in the Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection time-course is the shorter read length (76 nt in the Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection time-course vs. 101 nt in the WT infection time-course, both paired-end sequencing). CIRI2 and circRNA_finder require that at least one read overlaps by at least 19 and 20 nt, respectively, on both sides of identified circular junctions. Thus, longer reads could potentially lead to identification of more circRNAs. To address this issue, we pursued two alternative approaches. First, we trimmed reads from the WT infection time-course to 76 nt and applied our <italic>de novo</italic> circRNA detection method to these trimmed reads. Second, we implemented an alternative circRNA detection method based on aligning reads against circRNA junction sequences constructed from annotated circRNAs, which allowed to reduce or increase the required overlap on either side of the junction (see methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5 Fig</xref>). In this case, false positive rates are reduced by the restriction to annotated circRNAs. Both with trimmed reads and the alignment-based pipeline with a required overlap of only 10 nt, we observed approximately the same circRNA enrichment in WT infection as with the <italic>de novo</italic> detection pipeline on full reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S7 Fig</xref>). This confirms the strong <italic>vhs</italic>-dependent accumulation of circRNAs in WT HSV-1 infection. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all results reported in the following use the alignment-based pipeline requiring an overlap of at least 10 nt on either side of the junction.</p><p id="P10">We also analyzed data from a separate RNA-seq experiment in which we obtained total RNA for mock, WT, Δ<italic>vhs</italic> and ΔICP27 infection in the same experiment as well as subcellular fractions (chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic and cytosolic RNA) (all 8 h p.i., n=2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. This revealed an accumulation of circRNAs in total RNA of WT and ΔICP27 infection, but not Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S8 Fig</xref>), Notably, although linear regression analysis over all circRNAs (red line) estimated only a 1.5- to 2-fold accumulation in WT infection, some of the most highly expressed circRNAs accumulated more strongly. We conclude that <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated degradation of mRNAs leads to an accumulation of circRNAs relative to linear mRNAs during HSV-1 infection.</p><p id="P11">CircRNA reads that do not cross circular junctions can be aligned by standard RNA-seq mapping programs and are thus counted towards circRNA “parent” genes and exons in standard differential gene expression (DGE) and differential exon usage (DEU) analyses. Consequently, genes encoding for circRNAs tend to have significantly higher fold-changes in DGE analysis of total RNA in WT infection from 6 h p.i. (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p-value &lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S9 Fig a</xref>). This was not observed in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection. Similarly, DEU analysis with DEXSeq showed differential exon usage in WT infection for many exons contained in circRNAs (multiple testing adjusted p-value ≤0.005). By 8 h p.i. WT infection, ~17% of circRNAs showed differential exon usage for at least one exon within the genomic range of the circRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>), with increased exon usage for almost all of these circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>). This effect was most pronounced for highly expressed circRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S9 Fig b</xref>). Consistent with the small degree of circRNA accumulation late in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection, 3.6% of circRNAs also showed differential exon usage by 8 h p.i. Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S9 Fig c,d</xref>). In summary, our results demonstrate that accumulation of circRNAs in WT infection biases both DGE and DEU analyses of total RNA and thus needs to be taken into account in these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Induction of NEAT1 linear and circular splicing in HSV-1 infection</title><p id="P12">Strikingly, we identified one circRNA (circBase id: hsa_circ_0003812) that increased massively (up to &gt;500-fold in total and 4sU-RNA) in HSV-1 infection. In contrast to other circRNAs, this could be observed even in absence of <italic>vhs</italic> and in 4sU-, nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S10 Fig</xref>). The latter is particularly noteworthy considering the small number of circRNAs that were recovered in these samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S11 Fig</xref>). hsa_circ_0003812 is encoded in the unique part of the long NEAT1_2 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>) and was essentially absent in mock-infected cells (0-2 reads in 4sU-RNA, total RNA and all subcellular fractions, ≤0.22 normalized circRNA count). During infection, it was induced in all samples of infected cells (with the notable exception of cytosolic RNA), in particular also in ΔICP27 and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection, albeit to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S10 Fig</xref>). No other circRNA was induced this strongly, not even in presence of <italic>vhs</italic>. From 6 h p.i., the NEAT1_2 circRNA was among the most highly expressed circRNAs in 4sU-, total, chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic RNA with an 80- to 1,590-fold enrichment in WT infection compared to mock, 7- to 21-fold enrichment in ΔICP27 infection and 11- to 108-fold enrichment in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S10 Fig</xref>). The latter shows that, in contrast to other circRNAs, the NEAT1_2 circRNA is not induced simply by <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated degradation of the linear transcript. Consistent with the nuclear localization of NEAT1, some enrichment was also observed in cytosolic RNA of WT (but not ΔICP27 and Δ<italic>vhs</italic>) infection, but absolute levels in cytosolic RNA remained low. Other NEAT1_2 circRNAs were also detected in total RNA in WT infection, but only at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). Since nucleoplasmic, chromatin-associated and 4sU-RNA represent very recently transcribed RNA, our data indicate that the hsa_circ_0003812 NEAT1_2 circRNA is synthesized at very high rates during HSV-1 infection. This again contrasts with most other circRNAs, which cannot be recovered in newly transcribed RNA.</p><p id="P13">The hsa_circ_0003812 NEAT1_2 circRNA was previously found to be enriched in RNA-seq data of human fibroblasts after treatment with the 3’-&gt;5’ RNA exonuclease RNase R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], confirming that it is a circRNA. Notably, however, NEAT1_2, is partially resistant to RNase R due to the stabilizing triple helical structure at its 3’end, similar to MALAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Thus, the linear NEAT1_2 transcript is not strongly depleted by RNase R treatment even with an improved protocol using A-tailing prior to RNase R treatment and a Li+ buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">S12 Fig a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, we identified a study of circRNAs in Akata cells, in which the linear NEAT1_2 transcript was fully depleted by RNase R treatment in total and cytoplasmic RNA, yet partially resistant in nucleoplasmic RNA, while the hsa_circ_0003812 circRNA was always retained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">S12 Fig b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed significant enrichment of the circRNA region in our total RNA-seq time-course of WT infection from 6 h p.i. compared to both up- and downstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S13 Fig a</xref>, 1.5- to 1.76-fold increase in the DEXSeq analysis, multiple testing adjusted p&lt;0.005). This effect is likely not mediated by <italic>vhs</italic> since NEAT1_2 is located in the nucleus while <italic>vhs</italic> is active in the cytosol. Furthermore, some enrichment of the circRNA region was also observed in Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection by 8 h p.i., consistent with an attenuated progression of Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S13 Fig b</xref>). Both NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2 were found to be highly unstable in mouse, with half-lives of ~30 and ~60 min, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Thus, enrichment of the NEAT1_2 circRNA in HSV-1 infection is likely due to its high stability compared to the linear transcript combined with a high synthesis rate.</p><p id="P14">The following evidence further confirms that hsa_circ_0003812 is a circRNA and not an artefact of circRNA detection. First, it was identified by three distinct algorithms for circRNA detection that employ different approaches: CIRI2, circRNA_finder and our aligment-based approach. Combination of two or more different circRNA detection methods has been reported as highly successful in removing false positive predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Second, since false positives in circRNA detection largely originate from repetitive sequences, we performed a BLAST search in the human and HSV-1 genomes for the 20 nt on either side of the circular junction. This confirmed that both sequences are unique. Third, we ran our alignment-based circRNA detection approach with a required overlap of at least 40 nt on either side of circular junctions on the WT 4sU-seq and total RNA-seq time-courses. This still identified up to 170 reads for the NEAT1_2 circRNA in total RNA and up to 44 in 4sU-RNA (17-36% of reads identified with a ≥10 nt overlap) and confirmed the strong induction of this circRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">S14 Fig a,b</xref>). Finally, we implemented a method to determine so-called “confirming read pairs”, i.e. pairs of reads where both reads could be aligned linearly to the genome within a circRNA region but only in crosswise direction not consistent with a linear transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">S14 Fig c</xref>). We selected those confirming read pairs for which their genomic distance would imply a fragment size ≥500 nt (observed on average for &lt;3.7% of fragments) if they originated from a linear transcript and the fragment size would be smaller if they originated from the circRNA. In this way, we identified up to 45 confirming read pairs per replicate for hsa_circ_0003812 in WT infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">S14 Fig b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Strikingly, NEAT1_2 circular splicing was accompanied by induction of linear splicing both within the circRNA region as well as downstream of the circRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S15 Fig</xref>). None of these linear splicing events were annotated, but some were already observed at low rates in uninfected cells. Normalization to the number of exon-intron reads crossing the corresponding acceptor and donor splice sites showed that linear splicing was indeed induced and not simply observed more frequently due to the previously reported up-regulation of NEAT1 transcription in HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). Linear splicing was also induced downstream of the identified circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S15 Fig</xref>) and several of the confirming read pairs for the hsa_circ_0003812 circRNA included these linear splice junctions. Thus, both linear and circular NEAT1_2 transcripts were further spliced in HSV-1 infection. Canonical GT-AG splice signals were used both for the circular and the most frequent linear splice junctions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref> for a diagram) and they tended to be conserved at least among primates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">S16 Fig</xref>). Splicing rates and enrichment compared to mock differed substantially between the different linear splice junctions within the circRNA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>), indicating presence of alternative splicing isoforms of the circRNA. Induction of linear splicing was also observed in 4sU-, chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic RNA and in ΔICP27 and Δ<italic>vhs</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S15 Fig</xref>), although it was less pronounced in ΔICP27 infection. In summary, both linear and circular splicing of NEAT1_2 is induced during HSV-1 infection while the RNA is still associated with the chromatin. Although ICP27 is not required for NEAT1_2 splicing, it may contribute.</p><p id="P16">Recently, we also performed total RNA-seq of infection with mock, HSV-1 strain F (WT-F) and its ΔICP22 mutant at 8 and 12 h p.i. (n=2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. We furthermore generated telomerase-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (T-HFs) that express either ICP22 in isolation (T-HFs-ICP22 cells) or in combination with ICP27 (T-HFs-ICP22/ICP27 cells) upon doxycyclin (Dox) exposure. Total RNA-seq of T-HFs-ICP22 and T-HFs-ICP22/ICP27 cells was performed both with and without Dox exposure (n=2). Strikingly, we observed that ectopic co-expression of ICP22 and ICP27 lead to induction of both circular and linear splicing of NEAT1_2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). However, ICP22 knockout did not abolish HSV-1-induced NEAT1_2 circular and linear splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">S17 Fig</xref>), thus ICP22 expression is not required. This also confirmed induction of linear and circular NEAT1_2 splicing in a different HSV-1 strain. Although circRNA reads were recovered after Dox-induced expression of ICP22, this was limited to 2 reads in one replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To investigate whether ICP27 expression alone could induce NEAT1_2 splicing, we analyzed our recently published 4sU-seq data of mock and HSV-1 strain KOS infection and of cells transfected with an ICP27-expressing plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. This confirmed induction of both linear and circular NEAT1_2 splicing in HSV-1 KOS infection but recovered only one circular read upon ICP27 overexpression in one replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). In summary, our results show that neither ICP27 nor ICP22 are required for induction of linear and circular NEAT1_2 splicing but co-expression of both proteins is sufficient. Considering the small number of circular reads recovered when expressing either one of these proteins alone, we can neither confidently confirm nor exclude that either ICP22 or ICP27 alone may be sufficient to (weakly) induce NEAT1_2 circular splicing.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Influenza A virus infection also induces NEAT1_2 splicing</title><p id="P18">Since NEAT1_2 is also up-regulated in IAV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], we investigated presence of circRNAs in previously published total RNA-seq time-courses of influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus infection (3, 6, 12 and 18 h p.i. plus time-matched controls) of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (HTBE, multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM, MOI = 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. The H5N1 HALo mutant virus is an attenuated virus generated from WT influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04. H1N1 infection of HTBE cells included 24 h p.i. and two H5N1 infection time-courses of MDM cells were performed. This revealed a strong induction of NEAT1_2 circular splicing in H5N1 infection of both cell types and H3N2 infection of MDM cells as well as a weak induction in H3N2 infection of HTBE cells and H1N1 infection of MDM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">S18 Fig</xref>). The most highly expressed circRNA was again hsa_circ_0003812 circRNA as for HSV-1 infection (marked by a blue rectangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>) and its abundance increased with the duration of infection. Notably, hsa_circ_0003812 circRNA was also detected in some of the time-matched controls, however at significantly lower levels than in infected cells (with the exception of H1N1 infection of HTBE cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">S18 Fig a</xref>). Similar trends were observed for induction of linear splicing events, both within and downstream of the circRNA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">IAV infection also induces the degradation of host RNAs via two mechanisms. Cap-snatching by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to cleavage of host RNAs downstream of the cap and is required for synthesis of viral mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. The PA-X protein produced by all IAV strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] selectively degrades RNAs transcribed by Pol II, including long non-coding RNAs, and is localized and acts predominantly in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. To exclude that induction of the NEAT1_2 circRNA is simply due to degradation of linear transcripts, we also investigated overall accumulation of circRNAs in IAV infections using linear regression analysis on all circRNAs. This indeed showed an accumulation of circRNAs by up to 1.4-fold in H1N1 infection, 6.8-fold in H3N2 infection and 4.6-fold for H5N1 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">S19 Fig a-g</xref>). It also revealed induction beyond this overall accumulation for several other circRNAs, such as a circRNA of the ZC3HAV1 (zinc finger CCCH-type containing, antiviral 1) gene. ZC3HAV1 is induced during influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN/H1N1) infection and ectopic expression of ZC3HAV1 inhibits WSN replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Induction of the ZC3HAV1 circRNA thus likely results from up-regulation of ZC3HAV1 transcription and associated increased circRNA biosynthesis and is not simply a consequence of host RNA degradation. We compared fold-changes in normalized circRNA counts between infection and time-matched controls for 7077 well-expressed circRNAs (normalized circRNA count &gt;1 in at least one condition), which showed that the hsa_circ_0003812 NEAT1_2 circRNA was among the 1% most increased circRNAs in H3N2 and H5N1 infection of MDM cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">S19 Fig h</xref>). Occasionally, it was even more up-regulated than the ZC3HAV1 circRNA. Moreover, splicing of linear NEAT1_2 transcripts, which should not escape host mRNA degradation in IAV infections, is also induced during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that – at least in H3N2 and H5N1 infection – induction of NEAT1_2 circular splicing is not only a consequence of IAV-induced degradation of host mRNAs.</p><p id="P20">Since both HSV-1 and IAV infection disrupt transcription termination, we also evaluated read-through for IAV infection to correlate this to the extent of induction of NEAT1_2 splicing. Paralleling NEAT1_2 induction, read-through was higher in MDM cells than in HTBE cells and higher in H5N1 infection than in H3N2 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD20">S20 Fig</xref>), while H1N1 infection led to the lowest extent of read-through. Disruption of transcription termination in IAV infection is mediated by the viral NS1 protein via inhibition of the CPSF30 subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Our results are consistent with previous reports that the NS1 protein of A/California/04/09 H1N1 virus cannot bind and inhibit CPSF30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], while NS1 of the H3N2 and H5N1 strains can [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. However, a recent report indicated that the NS1-CPSF30 interaction is not necessary for disruption of transcription termination in IAV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. This could explain why read-through is still observed in H1N1 infection. A similar observation can be made in HSV-1 infection. Although HSV-1-induced disruption of transcription termination is mediated by ICP27 via interaction with CPSF subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], reduced but significant read-through is also observed in ΔICP27 infection likely as a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Due to this correlation between induction of NEAT1_2 splicing and read-through, we also analyzed our previously published 4sU-seq data of 1 and 2 h salt and heat stress regarding NEAT1_2 splicing. However, neither circular nor linear NEAT1_2 splicing was induced in either of the two stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CDK7 inhibition induces NEAT1_2 splicing and disrupts transcription termination in cancer cell lines</title><p id="P21">To shed additional light on the molecular mechanism(s) governing NEAT1_2 splicing, we searched the recount3 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] using Snaptron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] for presence of the novel linear NEAT1_2 splicing events. Recount3 provides read coverage data for &gt;700,000 publicly available human and mouse RNA-seq samples from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Snaptron allows rapidly searching samples in recount3 for (linear) splice junctions within specific genomic regions. Our Snaptron query recovered 6,391 human samples in which at least one of the four most frequent NEAT1_2 linear splice junctions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>) induced in HSV-1 infection was covered by ≥10 reads. This included our HSV-1 RNA-seq experiments, several other studies on HSV-1 infection, the IAV infection time-courses, 62 studies focusing on circRNAs and 21 using RNase R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">S21 Fig a</xref>). The latter provides further support for the association of linear and circular splicing of NEAT1_2. Strikingly, particularly high abundance of NEAT1_2 splice junctions was found in samples of blood cells, such as platelets, erythrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), erythroleukemia (K562) cells, and more (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">S21 Fig a</xref>). Consistently, one of these studies reported that circRNAs are strongly enriched in platelets and erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], which both lack a cell nucleus and thus <italic>de novo</italic> transcription. In absence of <italic>de novo</italic> transcription, the high stability of circRNAs leads to their accumulation.</p><p id="P22">Application of our circRNA alignment pipeline to two RNA-seq experiments for platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] and erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] identified multiple NEAT1_2 circRNAs including the hsa_circ_0003812 circRNA induced by HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">S21 Fig b</xref>). Interestingly, almost no expression was detected in the ~4 kb between the 3’end of the NEAT1_1 transcript and the 5’end of hsa_circ_0003812, however, expression extended beyond hsa_circ_0003812. This either implied novel linear transcripts beginning near the 5’end of hsa_circ_0003812 or a novel circRNA not included in circBase. Indeed, our <italic>de novo</italic> circRNA detection pipeline identified a novel circular junction connecting the 5’ end of hsa_circ_0003812 with the 3’end of the downstream expressed region. This confirms that only circular, but not linear, NEAT1_2 transcripts were present in these cells and that these circRNAs are also linearly spliced. It also shows that NEAT1_2 circRNAs naturally occur in uninfected cells, however at such low levels that they only become detectable upon degradation of linear transcripts. Since NEAT1_2 has been shown to be up-regulated in HSV-1 and IAV infection by RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], induction of NEAT1_2 circular splicing in HSV-1 and IAV infection cannot be explained by loss of <italic>de novo</italic> transcription followed by degradation of linear transcripts. However, this partly explains the presence of NEAT1_2 circular and linear junctions in uninfected cells from the IAV infection time-courses as MDM cells were obtained from blood.</p><p id="P23">Interestingly, the Snaptron search also identified induction of NEAT1_2 linear splicing after inhibition of CDK7 by THZ1 in multiple cancer cell lines. CDK7 is an essential part of the TFIIH transcription factor complex, phosphorylates Pol II CTD at Ser5 residues and plays key roles in maintenance of promoter-proximal Poll II pausing and the regulation of transcription elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Overexpression of CDK7 has been associated with a number of cancers and correlated to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. THZ1 is a highly selective covalent inhibitor of CDK7 with anti-tumor activity against multiple different types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], but also inhibits CDK12 and CDK13 at higher concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Experiments identified with the Snaptron search cover prostate cancer (VCaP, LNCaP and DU145 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], bladder cancer (HCV-29 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TE7 and KYSE510 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>], nasopharyngeal carcinoma (C666-1, HK1 and HNE1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>], pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (BxPC3, MiaPaCa-2 and PANC1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>] and chordoma (UM-Chor1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Further literature search identified a second study of chordoma cells (UM-Chor1 and CH22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>] with up to 24 h THZ1 treatment and a study on THZ1 treatment of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cells (Nalm6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. Realignment of corresponding samples confirmed linear splicing in all cell lines apart from DU145 and showed that induction increased with the duration and dosage of THZ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">S22 Fig a</xref>). One UM-Chor1 experiment also included actinomycin D (Act-D) treatment, which inhibits transcription but not via inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>]. Act-D treatment, while leading to a similar relative increase in the abundance of NEAT1_2 compared to NEAT1_1 as THZ1 treatment, did not induce NEAT1_2 splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">S22 Fig a</xref>). In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK7 in VCaP and LNCaP cells also induced NEAT1_2 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>), including many more novel splicing events that extended into the NEAT1_1 region. This indicates that indeed inhibition of CDK7, and not of other CDKs, induces NEAT1_2 splicing. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the MED1 component of the Mediator complex in VCaP and LNCaP cells had the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>). CDK7 directly phosphorylates MED1 at Threonine 1457 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], which together with a phosphorylation at Threonine 1032 promotes MED1 association with the Mediator complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. Mediator is responsible for communicating regulatory signals from gene-specific transcription factors to Pol II and in this way impacts transcription at multiple stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. Our results suggest that the effect of CDK7 inhibition on NEAT1_2 splicing may follow from the loss of MED1 phosphorylation and thus loss of MED1 association with Mediator.</p><p id="P24">Surprisingly, considering the previously observed strong association between linear and circular NEAT1_2 splicing, no NEAT1_2 circRNAs were recovered for any of these samples neither with our alignment-based nor our <italic>de novo</italic> circRNA discovery pipeline. However, in all cases almost no circRNAs (maximum 105 circRNAs, mean 18) were recovered at all, not even the most ubiquitous circRNAs such as HIPK3, CORO1C or ASXL1. As read length was ≥75 nt for all samples, this cannot be explained by short read length. It rather suggests that circRNAs were generally not or only poorly recovered in all these studies. While a literature search identified no other studies for specific CDK7 inhibition without poly(A) selection, the Snaptron search also recovered induction of linear NEAT1_2 splicing in chromatin-associated RNA of HEK293 cells upon 2 h treatment with DRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. DRB inhibits CDK7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>] but also the CDK9 kinase component of the positive P-TEFb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>] and other kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. DRB treatment indeed led to induction of the hsa_circ_0003812 NEAT1_2 circRNA induced by HSV-1 and IAV infection, but not any of the other NEAT1_2 circRNAs present in platelets and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">S22 Fig b</xref>). This provides some evidence that CDK7 inhibition induces NEAT1_2 circular splicing. In any case, identification of linear splicing in absence of circRNAs shows that the linear NEAT1_2 isoform is spliced upon CDK7 inhibition.</p><p id="P25">Interestingly, CDK7 inhibition also induced read-through transcription albeit to a lesser degree than HSV-1 or H5N1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>, example genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD23">S23 Fig</xref>). Read-through transcription after THZ1 treatment was comparable to H1N1 or H3N2 infection of HTBE cells, most pronounced in THZ1-treated Nalm6 cells and increased with the duration and dosage of THZ1 treatment in UM-Chor1 cells. In addition, both CDK7 and MED1 knockdown induced read-through at levels comparable to THZ1-treated Nalm6 cells. Interestingly, THZ1 treatment also resulted in extended antisense transcription at promoters, explaining the upstream transcription seen in the non-strand-specific RNA-seq for Nalm6 cells after THZ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD23">S23 Fig c,d</xref>). In summary, our results show that CDK7 inhibition impacts RNA transcription and processing at multiple levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">In this study, we report on novel circular and linear splicing of the long NEAT1_2 isoform induced in both HSV-1 and IAV infection. We focused on NEAT1_2 in this study for three reasons: (i) The NEAT1_2 circRNA was the only circRNA not simply enriched by <italic>vhs</italic>-mediated degradation of linear RNAs. (ii) It is one of the few circRNAs observed at high levels in newly transcribed 4sU-, nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated RNA during HSV-1 infection, indicating high levels of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. In contrast to these other few circRNAs, however, it is not or rarely produced in uninfected cells. (iii) NEAT1_2 has not previously been documented to be spliced either in a circular or linear fashion except for one linear splicing event towards the 3’end of NEAT1_2. This splicing event represented a shorter 793 nt version of the last “intron” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref> with the same 3’ but a different 5’ splice site and was recently reported to increase extractability of NEAT1_2 from the protein phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. Although it was also induced in HSV-1 and IAV infection, it was not among the most frequent splicing events. Re-alignment of the RNA-seq data by Chujo <italic>et al</italic>. confirmed this splicing event as well as splicing of the full last “intron” with very few reads (≤3), but no other splicing.</p><p id="P27">As NEAT1_2 participates in many RNA-protein interactions in paraspeckles, its unspliced form can only be poorly extracted from the protein phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. Similar observations were made for other architectural RNAs (arcRNAs) of nuclear bodies. As genomic deletion of the 793 nt intron identified by Chujo <italic>et al</italic>. did not significantly affect extractability, splicing itself appeared to be responsible for increased extractability. Chujo <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that NEAT1_2 as well as other arcRNAs must remain unspliced to allow formation of corresponding nuclear bodies. They hypothesized that competition by protein components of paraspeckles for binding of NEAT1_2 normally prevents association of splicing factors with NEAT1_2 and thus NEAT1_2 splicing. This raises the possibility that NEAT1_2 splicing during HSV-1 and IAV infection may simply be a by-product of up-regulation and thus increased availability of NEAT1_2 and consequently reduced competition between splicing factors and paraspeckle protein components. In HSV-1 infection, NEAT1_2 binds to serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) and is required for association of SRSF2 with promoters of the HSV-1 genes ICP0 and thymidine kinase (TK), which are upregulated by SRSF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>]. However, the SRSF2 binding sites in NEAT1_2 that are enriched upon HSV-1 infection are upstream of the HSV-1-induced circRNA. Thus, binding between SRSF2 and NEAT1_2 is likely not responsible for NEAT1_2 splicing. Moreover, this means that the linear NEAT1_2 transcript is required for SRSF2 association.</p><p id="P28">We demonstrated that the two immediate-early HSV-1 proteins ICP22 and ICP27 were sufficient to induce NEAT1_2 circular and linear splicing. However, neither of these two proteins were required nor sufficient on their own for (significant) induction of NEAT1_2 splicing. A possible explanation for this observation could be that NEAT1 was upregulated upon ectopic co-expression of ICP22 and ICP27 (2.2-fold, p&lt;10<sup>−11</sup>) and in ΔICP22 (2.1-fold, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) and ΔICP27 (4.9-fold, p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>) infection, but not upon expression of either ICP22 or ICP27 alone. Thus, up-regulation of NEAT1_2 could be the trigger for NEAT1_2 splicing rather than specific functions of ICP22 and ICP27. One line of evidence arguing against NEAT1_2 splicing being only a by-product of NEAT1_2 up-regulation is the absence of NEAT1_2 circular or linear splicing in heat stress despite NEAT1_2 also being up-regulated in the heat shock response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>].</p><p id="P29">Previously, NEAT1_2 knockdown in HeLa cells was shown to reduce HSV-1 glycoprotein density and intensity and inhibit plaque formation, an indicator of mature virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The vital role of NEAT1_2 for HSV-1 infection was also confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> as a thermosensitive gel containing NEAT1_2 siRNA could heal HSV-1-induced skin lesions in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This siRNA targeted the first “exon” within the circRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>), which is contained in both linear and circular spliced and unspliced NEAT1_2 transcripts. Interestingly, eCLIP data from ENCODE for the two core paraspeckle proteins SFPQ and NONO shows enriched binding of these proteins in NEAT1_2 within the two most frequently spliced “introns” (1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>), the “exon” between them, upstream of the circRNA 5’ end and towards the 3’end of NEAT1_2, but not in the first two “exons” and “intron” 3. Since NEAT1_2 circular splicing destroys linear transcripts and splicing of the linear NEAT1_2 transcript removes parts important for binding of paraspeckle proteins, up-regulation of NEAT1_2 splicing by unknown mechanisms could thus also be part of the immune response against HSV-1. Finally, SFPQ and NONO have recently been reported to bind around circRNA loci, and SFPQ depletion led to reduced expression of a subset of circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. Thus, these paraspeckle proteins itself could be involved in NEAT1_2 splicing.</p><p id="P30">Linear NEAT1_2 splicing, but likely also circular splicing, is also induced upon CDK7 inhibition in cancer cell lines and NEAT1_2 circRNAs are abundantly observed in various blood cells in absence of <italic>de novo</italic> transcription. However, the induction of NEAT1_2 splicing in HSV-1 and IAV infection and upon CDK7 inhibition is not simply due to loss of transcriptional activity as NEAT1 is up-regulated in HSV-1 and IAV infection and transcription inhibition by Act-D does not induce NEAT1_2 splicing. Interestingly, we found that selective CDK7 inhibition by THZ1 also disrupts transcription termination in cancer cell lines, albeit less strongly than HSV-1 and H5N1 infection. This was surprising considering a recent report that 1 h THZ1 treatment suppresses Pol II read-through at gene 3’ends in acute myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. It is, however, consistent with earlier reports of impaired transcription termination and 3’-end processing of an snRNA, a polyadenylated mRNA and a histone RNA upon CDK7 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. Our results thus demonstrate for the first time widespread disruption of transcription termination upon CDK7 inhibition. A possible explanation for the discrepancy to the study by Sampathi <italic>et al</italic>. is that more extensive CDK7 inhibition is necessary to sufficiently disrupt transcription termination as we observed significant read-through only after several hours of THZ1 treatment or CDK7 knockdown. Interestingly, CDK7 inhibition also leads to increased expression of the non-polyadenylated NEAT1_2 isoform relative to the polyadenylated NEAT1_1 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">S22 Fig a</xref>). This was also observed in HSV-1 and IAV infection, although not consistently, and raises the possibility that read-through transcription of the NEAT1_1 poly(A) site may be involved in induction of NEAT1_2 splicing by increasing abundance of NEAT1_2. Although salt and heat stress did not induce NEAT1_2 splicing, this does not exclude a role of read-through transcription. While there are strong overlaps between the genes affected by read-through in HSV-1 infection and stress conditions, there are also clear context- and condition-specific differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying disruption of transcription termination in stress conditions remain elusive. This contrasts with HSV-1 and IAV infection, where the HSV-1 ICP27 protein and the IAV NS1 protein have been shown to disrupt transcription termination via interaction with CPSF subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. It is important to note that our analyses of NEAT1_2 splicing and read-through upon CDK7 inhibition were performed in cancer cell lines, which are particularly susceptible to CDK7 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Dysregulation of alternative polyadenylation, often associated with wide-spread shortening of 3’UTRs, is common in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>]. NEAT1 also plays different roles in cancer development and both NEAT1 isoforms have been proposed as cancer biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>], with NEAT1_2 considered a tumor suppressor and NEAT1_1 considered to be oncogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. Thus, read-through, relative increase of NEAT1_2 expression, or NEAT1_2 splicing upon CDK7 inhibition could be linked to susceptibility of cancer cell lines to CDK7 inhibition.</p><p id="P31">This study identified several parallels between HSV-1 and IAV infection, on the one hand, and CDK7 inhibition, on the other hand. This not only includes read-through transcription and NEAT1_2 splicing, but also induction of antisense transcription upon CDK7 inhibition. We previously reported on widespread activation of antisense transcription in HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. Moreover, widespread loss of promoter-proximal pausing was recently reported both upon CDK7 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>] and HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>]. Previously, LDC4297A, a different selective inhibitor of CDK7, has been shown to have strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 as well as other herpesviruses (but only low efficacy against H1N1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>] and CDK7 has been found to be a target of CDK inhibitors inhibiting HSV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. Both studies confirm a role of CDK7 in HSV-1 infection. It is tempting to speculate that recruitment of CDK7-containing complexes, similar to recruitment of elongation factors like FACT by ICP22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>], to the HSV-1 genome may lead to a depletion of CDK7 on host genes, thus mimicking the effects of CDK7 inhibition. In summary, our findings highlight potential important roles of NEAT1_2 splicing and CDK7 in HSV-1 and/or IAV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>RNA-seq data</title><p id="P32">All RNA-seq data analyzed in this study were downloaded from the SRA.
