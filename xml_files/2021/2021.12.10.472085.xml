Specifically, immuno- and colorimetric-histochemical analysis of livers revealed markedly less periductal fibrosis surrounding the flukes and less fibrosis globally within the hepatobiliary tract during infection with <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> genotype worms, minimal biliary epithelial cell proliferation, and significantly fewer mutations of <italic>TP53</italic> in biliary epithelial cells.

Infection with <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic> is endemic in Thailand and Laos, where ~10 million people are infected with the parasite. Opisthorchiasis is associated with hepatobiliary diseases including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), bile duct cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Northeast Thailand reports the world’s highest incidence of CCA, &gt; 80 per 100,000 in some provinces. Indeed, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization classifies infection with <italic>O. viverrini</italic> as a Group 1 carcinogen, i.e. definitely carcinogenic in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Which features or consequences of parasitism by the liver fluke definitely initiate malignant transformation to CCA have yet to be ascertained notwithstanding that opisthorchiasis is the principal risk factor for CCA in regions where this neglected tropical disease remains endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Some factors can be expected to more important than others and the impact of these factors should be quantifiable. Different worm burdens play a role, based on rodent models of liver fluke infection associated CCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), as does concurrent exposure to nitrosamines in fermented foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) that are culturally important dietary staples in countries of the Lower Mekong River basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Moreover, dose-dependent, synergistic effects of the liver fluke and nitroso-compounds have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). To survive within the host, parasitic helminths actively release excretory/secretory (ES) proteins and other mediators with diverse effects and roles at the host-parasite interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This interaction is considered to manipulate host cellular homeostasis and, moreover, to underpin malignant transformation during chronic opisthorchiasis, but the molecular mechanisms by which these processes remain inadequately understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Focusing on the contribution of liver fluke ES to carcinogenesis, we targeted the <italic>O. viverrini</italic> granulin-like growth factor, <italic>Ov</italic>-GRN-1, a prominent component of the ES complement that we had determined previously induces phenotypic hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). <italic>Ov</italic>-GRN-1 and other ES components including extracellular vesicles enter cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells that line the biliary tract, and drive cellular signaling that promotes carcinogenesis, including cellular proliferation and migration, angiogenesis and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We have confirmed the role of <italic>Ov</italic>-GRN-1 in driving proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) by genetic manipulation of its expression in the liver fluke both by RNA interference and RNA-guided gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that infection of hamsters with the gene edited, infectious stage of the live fluke was feasible and that proliferation of biliary epithelia is markedly suppressed during infection with the <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> (<italic>Ov-grn-1-/-</italic>) flukes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P4">There is an established and instructive model of the pathogenesis of CCA in experimentally infected hamsters, <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> that is thought to replicate the epidemiology and pathogenesis of chronic human opisthorchiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In this model, malignancy manifests within a few months following infection with metacercariae of the parasite and concurrent exposure to otherwise sub-carcinogenic levels of dietary nitrosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In the hamster, chronic opisthorchiasis provokes periductal fibrosis, which, coincident with exposure to the nitric oxide carcinogen facilitates cholangiocyte proliferation, epithelial hyperplasia, DNA damage, and allied biliary tract lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), which can culminate in CCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Using this model, here we investigated the outcome of infection of hamsters with gene-edited <italic>O. viverrini</italic> liver flukes in relation to fluke-induced periductal fibrosis and malignant transformation. For this investigation, hamsters were infected with juvenile flukes that had been genetically modified using CRISPR before infection. Specifically, following up on our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) which focused on knockout of the <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> gene, here we included as comparators juvenile flukes gene-edited for a second virulence factor, tetraspanin (<italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), which also networks at the host-parasite interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and, as controls, flukes subjected to CRISPR transfection by an irrelevant (non-targeting) guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Immuno- and colorimetric-histochemical analysis of thin sections of liver revealed markedly less fibrosis during infection with <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> worms, reduced proliferation of cholangiocytes, substantially less expression of mutant forms of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and, overall, diminished malignancy of the liver. The clinically relevant, pathophysiological phenotype confirmed a role for <italic>Ov</italic>-GRN-1 in morbidity and malignancy during opisthorchiasis. Moreover, these findings underscored the utility and tractability of CRISPR-based genome editing for addressing gene function, essentiality, and pathogenesis in parasitic helminths generally.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Hamster model of malignant transformation during infection with gene-edited <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic></title><p id="P6">To investigate the effect of programmed gene knockout (KO) in <italic>O. viverrini</italic>, two experiments were undertaken in which hamsters were infected with newly excysted juveniles (NEJs) of <italic>O. viverrini</italic> that had been subjected to programmed KO. The CRISPR/Cas systems were delivered by electroporation of plasmids encoding guide RNAs specific for <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic>, <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> and an irrelevant (control) guide RNA. All groups received plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates the experimental approach and timelines, the findings from which we present below. Initially, juvenile flukes were subjected to transfection after which reduction in transcription of the targeted genes, <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> and <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic>, was verified. Subsequently, following successful KO of transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>, additional juvenile <italic>O. viverrini</italic> were transfected before infection of hamsters. The goal of Experiment 1 was to assess impact of KO on the worm burden. At necropsy14 weeks after infection, the entire liver was examined, the worms were recovered and counted, and transcriptional changes were investigated in the worms. With Experiment 2, the primary goal was establishment and assessment of disease burden including malignant transformation during infection. Given that livers from the hamsters in Experiment 2 were fixed at necropsy, worm burdens could not be established directly because recovery of the flukes is a process that damaged the liver and biliary tract and, accordingly, was incompatible with histological examination of infection-associated disease. Consequently, only a small number flukes were available from Experiment 2 and these that were available were collected incidentally during preparation of the liver lobes for fixation. Nonetheless, this sample of the flukes from each of the three groups was sufficient to assess the performance and level of programmed KO although total worm burden was unavailable. Nonetheless, the findings from Experiment 2 provided the first description of gene-edited flukes in chronically-infected hamsters, i.e., with duration of infection beyond eight weeks and, additionally, the first time programmed mutation of the liver fluke genome has been combined with exposure to dietary nitrosamine in the hamster-liver fluke model of human CCA.</p><p id="P7">Changes in transcription of the targeted genes induced by programmed mutations were monitored by RT-qPCR in newly excysted juveniles (NEJs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Control (irrelevant gRNA) group flukes was used to normalize expression level from 100% (no change) to 0% (complete ablation of expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). For the <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> group, <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> was used as an off-target gene control, and <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> was used as an off-target control for the <italic>ΔOv-tsp-2</italic> group. Relative to the control group, <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> transcript levels were substantially reduced in the <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> flukes (bootstrapped average, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.4%, 61.8-63.1%) whereas the transcription of <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> increased marginally (&lt; 20% change) in the <italic>ΔOv-grn-1</italic> flukes (117.8%, 95% CI: 110.2-127.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transcription of <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> was substantially reduced in the <italic>ΔOv-tsp-2</italic> flukes (37.9%, 95% CI: 36.7-39.1%). Levels of <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> transcripts (102.1%, 95% CI: 101.8-102.5%) were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This outcome revealed gene-specific, on-target knockout at the <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> and <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> loci. Gene expression analyses were restricted to the two targeted genes and hence we cannot conclude that off-target mutations did not occur.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Differential outcomes for adult flukes following knockout of <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> and <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic></title><p id="P8">In Experiment 1, feces were sampled at both weeks 10 and 12 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Significant differences in fecal egg counts (EPG) were not apparent among the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Hamsters were euthanized and necropsied at week 14 to investigate the numbers of adult <italic>O. viverrini</italic>. There were 60.0±3.46 (mean ± SEM), 36.7±3.48, and 21.3±2.96 worms in the control, <italic>ΔOv</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic>, and <italic>ΔOv-tsp-</italic>2 groups, respectively, reflecting reductions of 38.9% for <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> and 64.5% for <italic>Ov-tsp-</italic>2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). A trend was apparent toward increased egg burdens in hamsters with higher worm burdens but the correlation not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Of the worms recovered in Experiment 1, gene transcript levels relative to the control flukes were assessed for 10-13 flukes from each of the three hamsters in each group. Transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) of both genes expressed by the control parasites clustered around 100% of wild-type fluke expression levels with bootstrap averages of 114.1% (95% CI: 104.2-126.5%) and 103.2% (95% CI: 98.4-107.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Transcript levels for <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> ranged broadly in the <italic>ΔOv</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> flukes from no change (~100%) to complete ablation (~0%) and, overall, were substantially reduced at 11.8% (95% CI: 4.5-28.8%) of levels seen in wild-type flukes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This phenotypic range, no change to ablation of transcripts in <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1,</italic> was similar to our previous findings. In contrast to the juvenile flukes, where there was substantial knockdown of <italic>Ov-tsp</italic>-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), transcript levels were not markedly reduced in adult <italic>ΔOv-tsp</italic>-2 flukes (82.5%, 95% CI: 73.6-91.5%) compared to the controls (103.2%, 95% CI: 98.4-103.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, most flukes in the <italic>ΔOv-tsp</italic>-2 group were unchanged with only two individual flukes exhibiting &gt; 50% reduction in <italic>Ov-tsp</italic>-2 expression. We posit that this marked difference, in comparison to transcript levels for <italic>Ov-tsp</italic>-2 in juvenile flukes, i.e. reduced by 62.1%, in addition to the 65% reduction of worms recovered at necropsy, <italic>Ov-tsp-2</italic> KO led to a lethal phenotype and that flukes of this genotype failed to survive <italic>in vivo</italic>. This contrasted with <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> KO where the majority of flukes of the <italic>ΔOv</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> genotype survived even though transcription of <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> was not detected in four of 36 flukes, and 10 of 36 exhibited <italic>Ov</italic>-<italic>grn-1</italic> transcript levels &lt; 5% of levels expressed by the control worms.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Parasitological impact of gene knockout</title><p id="P9">Quantitative assessment by histopathological and histochemical analysis of hepatobiliary disease at 24 weeks of infection was a primary goal for Experiment 2.

Nonetheless, we collected a sample of the resident <italic>O. viverrini</italic> flukes before formalin fixation of the liver for molecular screening to assess the efficacy of programmed gene knockout. As an accepted correlate of the number of worms parasitizing each hamster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), fecal egg counts (as eggs per gram of feces, EPG) were determined at the time of necropsy. EPG values ranged broadly among the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), with feces of the control fluke infected hamsters displaying the highest EPG values, median of 11,062 EPG (95% CI: 4,814-26,536), the <italic>ΔOv</italic>-<italic>grn</italic>-<italic>1</italic> group, 5,267 EPG (95% CI: 2,695-8535), and the <italic>ΔOv-tsp-2 group,</italic> 4,530 EPG (95% CI: 518-10,227) in the same rank order in numbers of worms recovered from these groups in Experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

summary</title></caption><p>Infection with the human liver flukes, <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>, <italic>O. felineus</italic> and <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> remains a public health concern in regions where these parasites are endemic. <italic>O. viverrini</italic> is endemic in the Mekong River drainage countries of including Thailand and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Infection follows the consumption of undercooked freshwater fish harboring the parasite. Liver fluke infection, opisthorchiasis, is associated with diseases of the liver and bile ducts including cancer of the biliary tract, cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer with a poor prognosis. This report characterizes for the first time experimental infection with gene-edited <italic>O. viverrini</italic> liver flukes during concurrent exposure to nitrosamine in a rodent model of liver fluke infection-associated cancer. Cancer development was slowed in hamsters infected with the parasite following CRISPR-based knock-out mutation and loss of a parasite gene known to stimulate growth of cells lining the bile ducts. These findings describe a new model for investigation of risk factors for infection-associated cholangiocarcinoma and to assess efficacy of anti-infection/anti-cancer vaccines.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the experimental design.</title><p>Hamsters were infected with juvenile Opisthorchis viverrini worms that had been subjected to gene knockout. Two experiments were conducted. (<bold>A</bold>). The goal of experiment 1 was to assess the impact of CRISPR/Cas9 editing on fluke survival. The goal of experiment 2 was to assess the influence of gene knockout on pathogenesis and malignant transformation. Groups of hamsters were infected with flukes transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids targeting either Ov-grn-1 (red, ΔOv-grn-1), Ov-tsp-2 (green, ΔOv-tsp-2), or irrelevant guide RNA (blue, control) and exposed to dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN) in the drinking water. At timepoints indicated for each experiment, fecal egg numbers were measured as eggs per gram of feces (EPG). Experiment 1: From the livers of euthanized hamsters, all the flukes were recovered and transcript levels assessed. Experiment 2: Liver lobes were sectioned and stained for histochemical analysis. Flukes incidentally released from bile ducts were collected and assessed for gene knockout. Before infection, transcript levels of Ov-grn-1 (<bold>B</bold>) and Ov-tsp-2 (<bold>C</bold>) were assessed in juvenile flukes. Transcript levels established by qPCR were plotted relative to average control transcript levels from 2-4 biological replicates; average shown with colored bar and with 95% confidence interval error bars.
