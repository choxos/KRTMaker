Tightly controlled ECM homeostasis is essential for healthy connective tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Tissue repair after injury entails a cascade of inflammation, repair and ultimately resolution. Tissue resident macrophages can sense ECM composition. Signals from damaged tissue initiate a dynamic process that involves the recruitment of immune cells, which help to induce fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, which in turn deposit ECM to repair the tissue. Finally, myofibroblasts are eliminated and the ECM is degraded and remodeled, in order to resolve the repair process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Fibrosis is an abnormal reparative process that is characterized by excessive ECM deposition without reciprocal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This progressive accumulation of ECM results in remodeling of the tissue architecture and can lead to organ failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The fibrotic scar consists predominantly of fibrillar collagens (types I and III), fibronectin and basement-membrane proteins such as type IV collagen and laminin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Complex cellular and molecular processes drive fibrosis, with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family proteins playing a central role by stimulating the synthesis of ECM proteins by effector cells such as myofibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a prototypical immune-mediated fibrotic disease, characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The etiology of SSc is largely unknown and patients can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, resulting in high morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Typically, immune cell infiltration into skin and internal organs occurs early in the disease, prior to the onset of fibrosis. Immune mediators such as TGFβ - namely TGFβ2, type I interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), IL-6 and type 2 cytokines (including IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) are considered central to the pathogenesis of SSc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, the chemokine CXCL4 is increased in the circulation and skin of SSc patients and correlates with the presence and progression of complications such as lung fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">ECM proteins interact with different cell types through cell surface receptors, including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and immunoglobulin-like receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Leukocyte associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1; CD305) is an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM)-bearing inhibitory receptor for collagen, broadly expressed on most immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Activation of LAIR-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> potently inhibits diverse immune cells such as T cells, NK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. LAIR-1 inhibitory function can be regulated at the membrane expression level and by the natural agonists soluble-LAIR-1 (sLAIR-1), a shed form of LAIR-1, and LAIR-2. LAIR-2 is a soluble protein, homologous to human LAIR-1, lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domain, with a higher affinity for collagens than LAIR-1, thereby blocking LAIR-1 ligation to collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">LAIR-1 is expressed on immune cells in healthy skin, where it can interact with collagens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It recognizes multiple collagens and collagen-domain containing proteins. Collagens have multiple functional binding sites for LAIR-1, the glycine-proline-hydroxyproline content of collagen domains appears to be the dominant determinant for LAIR-1 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In fibrotic tissues such as those in SSc patients, there should be abundant amounts of collagen to be sensed by LAIR-1 on tissue immune cells, yet inflammation continues. We here questioned whether in SSc, impaired LAIR-1-collagen interaction is contributing to the ongoing inflammation and fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LAIR-1 expression and its intrinsic function is normal in SSc patients</title><p id="P8">We first investigated whether the function of LAIR-1 is impaired in patients with SSc. We determined LAIR-1 expression on circulating immune cells from SSc patients and healthy controls (HC) by flow cytometry. LAIR-1 expression at the cell surface was comparable between SSc patients and HC on type-2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells and B cells and on most monocyte subsets. In classical monocytes, LAIR-1 expression was significantly increased in SSc patients compared to HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, LAIR-1 was not expressed on type-1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) (data not shown).</p><p id="P9">In affected skin of SSc patients, available profiling data by array [GSE95065] show that <italic>LAIR1</italic> gene expression was increased in the skin of SSc patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>), probably reflecting an increase in immune cells, given the strong correlation between <italic>LAIR1</italic> expression and <italic>PTPRC</italic> (gene encoding CD45) and moderate correlation with the macrophage marker <italic>CD68</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). By immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that LAIR-1 was expressed in skin from HC and SSc patients, both in affected and non-affected skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, LAIR-1 is expressed on circulating immune cells and skin of patients with SSc.</p><p id="P10">We next investigated whether LAIR-1 on immune cells from SSc patients retains its capacity to inhibit cellular activation. Monocytes and pDC from HC and SSc patients were stimulated with TLR ligands together with an antibody that acts as a LAIR-1 agonist. LAIR-1 activation in both groups caused a similar inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-α production by monocytes and IFN-α production by pDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the intrinsic inhibitory function of LAIR-1 is preserved in SSc patients.</p><p id="P11">We further explored whether soluble mediators in the circulation of SSc patients could block collagen interaction with cellular LAIR-1. For this purpose, labelled collagen was incubated with serum from SSc patients or HC after which collagen binding to a LAIR-1 overexpressing line was determined by flow cytometry. Serum from SSc patients and HC blocked collagen binding to LAIR-1 to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this finding, circulating concentrations of sLAIR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and LAIR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) were not different between SSc patients and HC. Altogether, these experiments indicate that LAIR-1 is normally expressed, has preserved inhibitory capacity, and does not encounter higher levels of known LAIR-1 antagonists in SSc patients compared to HC.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LAIR-1 binds to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> fibrotic ECM</title><p id="P12">We have previously shown that LAIR-1 is able to bind to collagen in healthy skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The fibrotic collagen present in the skin of SSc patients is structurally different from that found in healthy skin, with dense, aligned dermal collagen bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, which potentially could affect LAIR-1 binding. However, we observed that LAIR-1 binding to both HC and SSc skin samples was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Fibroblasts in the skin of SSc patients are constantly exposed to inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors, such as TGFβ and CXCL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We mimicked these circumstances <italic>in vitro</italic> by culturing dermal fibroblasts obtained from HC and SSc patients in the presence of TGFβ or CXCL4 and visualized collagen I deposition by immunofluorescence. TGFβ treatment induced enhanced collagen I production compared to untreated (medium) cultures, and collagen was deposited in characteristic aligned fibers, both in cultures of fibroblasts from SSc patients and from HC. In contrast, CXCL4 stimulation resulted in more disorganized collagen I, particularly in fibroblasts from SSc patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We assessed LAIR-1 binding to the deposited ECM using a hLAIR-1-IgG fusion protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We observed that LAIR-1 efficiently bound to the ECM produced by fibroblasts from both HC and SSc patients, both in non-stimulated and stimulated conditions. However, when compared to HC, SSc dermal fibroblasts stimulated with CXCL4 produced an increased amount of dense, non-fibrillar shaped structures that bound LAIR-1 but did not bind collagen I antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, SSc fibroblasts stimulated with CXCL4, produce an ECM structure that is not recognized by collagen I antibodies and binds LAIR-1.</p><p id="P14">We next determined whether HC dermal fibroblasts stimulated with the potent pro-fibrotic combination of TGFβ and CXCL4 induced similar LAIR-1 binding structures as observed in SSc fibroblasts treated with CXCL4 only. Indeed, after stimulation with TGFβ and CXCL4, HC fibroblasts deposited similar dense structures binding LAIR-1 but not collagen I antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The deposition of these structures increased evidently over time and was preferentially localized to decellularized areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-staining of the ECM with a pan-collagen mix of antibodies (recognizing collagen I, II, III, IV and V) revealed these structures as collagen, even though they did not have a typical fibrillar collagen conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that these structures do not bind to human Signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (hSIRL-1), a protein with homology to LAIR-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To study these fibrotic collagen structures at the nanoscale, fibroblasts were stimulated with TGFβ2 and CXCL4 for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High-resolution TEM images showed that the ECM of the non-stimulated (medium) condition was composed mostly of aligned collagen fibers that were homogenously interspaced and run parallel to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, collagen fibers in the ECM produced by fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ2 and CXCL4 were more frequently disorganized, had unidirectional orientation, and sometimes formed dense bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>-black arrows and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4A-B</xref>). The disrupted organization of collagen fibers upon TGFβ2 and CXCL4 treatment can possibly be a consequence of the degradation of collagen fibers or collagen associated proteins responsible for their organization.</p><p id="P16">Since degraded and fragmented collagen triple helices may become unstable and spontaneously unfold, leaving denatured collagen fragments, we next assessed whether the LAIR-1 binding structures correspond to denatured collagen. We used a collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP), which specifically binds to denatured collagen strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. CHP did bind in cell-dense areas where collagen is actively produced but did not co-localize with the LAIR-1-binding collagen structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that the collagen triple helical conformation is intact in the degraded fibers, in agreement for a need of a triple helical conformation for LAIR-1 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ and CXCL4 deposit dense structures consisting of degraded triple helical collagen in decellularized areas that specifically bind LAIR-1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PDGF receptor signaling and Matrix Metalloproteinases are required for deposition of fibrotic LAIR-1 binding structures</title><p id="P17">The areas where the LAIR-1-binding dense collagen structures were deposited in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures were devoid of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). By live cell imaging, we observed that the combination of TGFβ with CXCL4 drastically altered the motility of both HC and SSc dermal fibroblasts. Instead of forming an intact cellular monolayer, fibroblasts became highly motile, losing contact inhibition and forming multicellular layers, while leaving behind large decellularized areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental video 1-2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Since PDGF signaling regulates proliferation and cell motility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we next assessed whether this pathway could be involved in the production of the fibrotic LAIR-1 binding structures. Indeed, PDGF receptor inhibition in fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ plus CXCL4 reduced cell motility and prevented the formation of multicellular layers of fibroblasts and the occurrence of decellularized areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental video 3-6</xref>), as well as of the deposition of LAIR-1-binding structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, PDGF-mediated fibroblast activation is required for the formation of these fibrotic collagen structures.</p><p id="P19">Next, we tested whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were involved in the generation of the fibrotic LAIR-1-binding structures. Inhibition of MMP activity in HC dermal fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ plus CXCL4 reduced the amount of LAIR-1-binding ECM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), and decreased cell motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental video 7-10</xref>). Thus, the deposition of the LAIR-1-binding fibrotic structures requires cell motility and loss of cell contact inhibition mediated by PDGF receptor signaling and collagen degradation by MMPs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fibrotic collagen products have impaired capacity to activate LAIR-1</title><p id="P20">While the fibrotic collagen structures that we identified bind to hLAIR-1-IgG, we wondered whether they are functional ligands that can activate cellular LAIR-1. To investigate the effect of degraded collagen on LAIR-1 activation, we first used gelatin, which is a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen, resulting in small collagen fragments.</p><p id="P21">hLAIR-1-IgG bound in a dose dependent manner to plate-bound purified collagen I and, to a lesser extent to gelatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, to assess the capacity of gelatin to activate LAIR-1, we used a NFAT-GFP reporter cell line transfected with LAIR-1-CD3ζ, which expresses Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) when LAIR-1 is activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Optimal LAIR-1-CD3ζ-induced GFP production was achieved at ~6 µg/mL of immobilized collagen I, while lower concentrations or higher concentrations resulted in a lower percentage of GFP expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, gelatin did not induce GFP production at any of the concentrations tested, even at concentrations where hLAIR-1-hIg effectively bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). These results suggest that collagen degraded by partial hydrolysis can bind LAIR-1 but cannot activate LAIR-1.</p><p id="P22">To investigate whether the fibrotic ECM structures that we identified are functional ligands for LAIR-1, we performed the same reporter cell assay on ECM produced by fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ and CXCL4. We were able to trigger GFP expression in approximately 24% of LAIR-1-CD3ζ reporter cells using purified human collagen immobilized in the same culture vessel used in our ECM culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). ECM produced by unstimulated fibroblasts triggered GFP expression in 16.25±3.07% of the LAIR-1-CD3ζ reporter cells. However, ECM produced by TGFβ plus CXCL4 stimulated cells only resulted in 7.54±1.27% of GFP+ LAIR-1-CD3ζ reporter cells, which is a 54% reduction in the capacity to activate LAIR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). We additionally performed a live reporter cell assay on ECM produced by fibroblasts from HC and SSc patients after stimulation with TGFβ plus CXCL4. After 70 hours of culture, GFP positive reporter cells were detected in areas where intact collagen structures were present. In contrast, in the decellularized regions, where degraded hLAIR-1-IgG binding collagen structures are deposited, LAIR-1-CD3ζ reporter cells were not induced to express GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental video 11-14</xref>). This indicates that, despite having the capacity to bind LAIR-1, these degraded collagen structures did not activate LAIR-1. The production of degraded collagen in fibrotic conditions such as SSc could thus lead to incapacitated LAIR-1 inhibitory function and immune cell control.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Absence of LAIR-1 leads to increased bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis in the SSc mouse model</title><p id="P23">To investigate if the absence of functional LAIR-1 signaling would indeed lead to enhanced fibrosis, we subjected <italic>Lair1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to the bleomycin-induced fibrosis model. This is a well-established mouse model of SSc, in which daily subcutaneous injections of bleomycin are used to induce skin fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

LAIR-1 function can be obstructed by the production of decoy ligands in fibrotic tissue, potentially perpetuating the fibrotic process in diseases like SSc.</p><p id="P28">LAIR-1 expression and intrinsic function was comparable in cells from SSc patients and HC, which is in line with our previous findings, that under inflammatory conditions LAIR-1 is expressed and upon ligation still efficiently reduces cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, the concentration of soluble LAIR-1 antagonists in the circulation of SSc patients is similar to HC, in contrast to the increased concentration of sLAIR-1 and LAIR-2 observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients and in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Despite normal LAIR-1 expression and function in cells from SSc patients, an inadequate ligand might undermine its inhibitory function. Collagen synthesis is highly upregulated in SSc tissues, leading to compensatory collagen degradation mechanisms. Several MMPs, including MMP7, MMP9 and MMP12, are increased in SSc patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, translating to increased concentrations of collagen degradation products in the circulation and in the skin, suggesting a high collagen turnover in this disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, despite increased collagen degradation, excessive collagen production still results in an imbalance and enormous accumulation of collagen in tissues and organs of these patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">We now report that even though LAIR-1 can bind to the fibrotic skin of SSc patients and to the ECM deposited by fibroblasts under pro-fibrotic conditions, it cannot be functionally activated by the collagen products that are formed. Thus, these structures may act as decoy ligands and compete with intact collagen to prevent inhibitory signaling by LAIR-1. In contrast, larger collagen fragments, ranging from 30-75 kDa, have the ability to prevent the formation of osteoclasts and to inhibit T cell response through a LAIR-1-dependent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">Conversely, smaller fragments do not exhibit this inhibitory effect on osteoclast formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. This suggests that the length of the fragment plays a critical role in activating LAIR-1, and that potentially small collagen fragments could act as decoy molecules. Interestingly, gelatin, which is a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by the partial hydrolysis of collagen consists of small collagen fragments and also has the capacity to bind LAIR-1 but not to activate it. We previously found that LAIR-1 binding to trimeric collagen peptides is influenced by glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) content of collagen, and recently it was shown that citrullinated collagen binds LAIR-1, but does not signal, resulting in inactive LAIR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, although other factors contribute to the interaction as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, we identified a collagen peptide (II-17) that binds to LAIR-1 but is unable to induce LAIR-1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, biochemical and structural alterations of collagen determine the LAIR-1 functional response.</p><p id="P32">The inadequate activation of LAIR-1 by fibrotic collagen could be partly explained by the lack receptor clustering in analogy to glycoprotein VI (GPVI). GPVI is a collagen activating receptor on platelets and the collagen-binding domain is homologous of LAIR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The proximity of GPVI dimer-binding sites on the collagen fiber surface enables clustering of GPVI dimers, increasing avidity and bringing together the necessary components to initiate receptor signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> LAIR-1 may have similar requirements for signaling. While short collagen degradation products may be sufficient for LAIR-1 binding, signaling may require longer collagen fibers containing a greater number of binding sites for LAIR-1 clustering inducing a downstream signaling cascade.</p><p id="P33">The production of the fibrotic collagen products in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system upon repeated exposure to TGFβ and CXCL4 is dependent on PDGF receptor signaling and MMP activity. PDGF family members are potent mitogenic factors and are involved in chemotaxis and cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Both PDGFs and PDGFRs are upregulated in skin lesions of SSc patients and this pathway promotes myofibroblast activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, PDGF proteins, particularly PDGF-D, upregulate the expression of multiple MMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and are consequently implicated in collagen degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Collagen fragments, particularly 3/4 length collagen fragments, in turn enhance PDGF migratory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, which may contribute to the increased motility we observed upon TGFβ plus CXCL4 stimulation. Indeed, MMP inhibition reduced cell motility, in agreement with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">The presence of collagen degradation products in SSc, as result of MMP activity and PDGF signaling as our data indicate, may lead to an inefficient LAIR-1 inhibitory signal in immune cells and thus perpetuate inflammation and consequent fibrosis in these patients.</p><p id="P35">In mice, the absence of LAIR-1 resulted in an increased presence of αSMA<sup>+</sup> myofibroblast and increased collagen deposition and dermal thickness, not only in response to the fibrosis-promoting agent bleomycin, but also in response to the repetitive skin injury caused by the control injections. Thus, LAIR-1 deficient mice are more sensitive to developing fibrosis upon injury. This finding was consistent throughout experiments, although we did observe variability in the extension of the increased skin fibrosis in LAIR-1 deficient mice, reflected either by skin caliper, collagen content or histology, which may have been due to differences in the efficacy of bleomycin inducing skin fibrosis as well as different operators performing the model in different experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">Since LAIR-1 can regulate a large variety of immune cells, it is possible that the exacerbated fibrotic phenotypic observed in LAIR-1 deficient mice is driven by multiple immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, DCs, T cells and B cells. In particular, inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages highly express LAIR-1 and are key regulators that maintain tissue homeostasis and are important for both driving and resolving tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Further studies are needed to determine which cell types are essential for LAIR-1 mediated regulation of fibrosis.</p><p id="P37">Taken together, we identified a crucial role for LAIR-1 in the regulation of tissue repair using LAIR-1 deficient mice and show that in response to soluble factors that drive inflammation and fibrosis in SSc, human fibroblasts generate large amounts of degraded collagen, with impaired capacity to induce LAIR-1 signaling. Our data may explain how dysregulation can occur in fibrosis resulting in a vicious cycle: LAIR-1 normally senses collagen thus providing negative feedback to further collagen production, while collagen fragments, presumably generated during injury, prevent the negative feedback so that new collagen can be made to replace degraded collagen. However, collagen fragments produced under inflammatory conditions can remove this negative feedback even when there is excess collagen present in fibrotic tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). Thus, a circuit designed to maintain homeostasis has a vulnerability to dysregulation resulting in fibrosis.</p><p id="P38">Since LAIR-1 is expressed and intrinsically functional in SSc patients, our study opens novel avenues for the treatment of SSc and perhaps other fibrotic diseases by harnessing the LAIR-1 feedback loop to halt the cascade of inflammation and fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p id="P39">Blood from SSc patients was obtained from the University Medical Center Utrecht and Maasstad Hospital Rotterdam.
