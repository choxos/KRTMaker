<abstract>
<p id="P1">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) continue to wreak havoc across the globe. Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> <italic>in vitro</italic>. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta- variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future. This report characterized the therapeutic antibodies specific to the tip of spike against SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlights the potential clinical applications as well as for developing vaccine and cocktail therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Since the first Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) case was diagnosed at the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200 million confirmed infections and 4.5 million deaths in the following eighteen months, with no sign of stopping (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus</ext-link>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. The hope-placed distribution of vaccines once appeared effectively controlling the virus spread. However, the antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the spike (S) protein associated with receptor binding, alters the viral immunogenicity facilitating the virus’s immune escape and crossing transmission barriers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S protein is a determinant that mediates the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD were proved to be effective<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Correspondingly, substitutions on RBD may reduce neutralizing efficacy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Several variants, listed as Variant of Concern (VOC), featured with RBD substitutions and non-RBD mutations showed to have higher transmissibility and led to more severe illness<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, which has been causing great global dissemination concern. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha) was first identified in United Kingdom in late summer of 2020 and rapidly became the dominant variant. This variant has nine mutations in the S protein, one of which is N501Y in RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Alpha variant possesses a comparative transmission advantage, with a reproductive number 50% to 100% higher than other non-VOC lineages<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses were shown to be at risk of being desensitized by Alpha<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta) has three substitutions in RBD, i.e., K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Incorporation of E484K empowers variants possible being completely resistant to plasma neutralization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Mutations E484K together with K417N and N501Y largely contribute to the escape of Beta variant from convalescent and vaccine-induced sera<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (Gamma) shares three identical site-mutations in RBD with Beta variant, and their differences are that the substitution of K417 is threonine in Gamma variant, while is asparagine in Beta variant. Similarly, Gamma variant notably reduced susceptibility to antibody treatment and vaccine protection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) was first reported in India and quickly spread globally in the first half of 2021. This strain has more than ten S protein mutations and two of them, L452R and T478K, are in RBD. Delta variant exhibits more extensive immunologic resistance than Alpha, escaping from many S protein antibodies targeting RBD and non-RBD epitopes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Individuals who recovered from Beta and Gamma variants are more susceptible to be infected with Delta<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. In addition to these VOCs, potential outbreaks of several variants have raised public concern, such as the recently rapidly spreading variant C.37 (Lambda)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup> and the new variant B.1.621 (Mu)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. The emergence of these variants, even possible hybrid variants, raises the risk of compromising the therapeutic effectiveness of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies that were previously developed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Here we report our efforts on discovering neutralizing antibodies that provide extensive protection against the variants with global impact, especially the VOCs. We isolated RBD positive single B cells from convalescent individuals and cloned monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) within. After a series of programmed screening, several antibodies with remarkable neutralizing effect were panned out from the candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). One of these antibodies, designated as 2G1, efficiently neutralized all VOCs including widely spread Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta variants and Cluster 5, a variant with Y453F substitution once caused public concern due to the zoonotic characteristics. The antibody 2G1 was subsequently fully characterized physic-chemically and biologically, as well as evaluated in potential in clinical applications.</p>

<p id="P5">We collected blood samples from 20 convalescent individuals who were infected by SARSCoV-2 in February 2020. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched and sorted with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (WA1/2020) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Over 1200 B cells were isolated and more than 500 pairs of IgG antibody genes were cloned by single-cell PCR. Of which, 375 are kappa subtype and 174 are lambda subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). 143 RBD binders were obtained after the ELISA-based preliminary screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In the following pseudovirus-based screening, three molecules, including 2G1, displayed ultra-potent neutralization with IC<sub>50</sub> less than 0.01 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Antibody 2G1 stood out from these candidates after further investigation despite the binding and ACE2 blocking abilities were not remarkable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S1a-b</xref>). In the germline analysis of 33 candidates, 23 heavy chains were from IGHV3 and 18 light chains were from IGKV1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S2</xref>). Six heavy chains, including 2G1, were from IGHV3-53, which was reported having short complementarity-determining region and with minimal affinity but high efficacy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">WA1/2020 RBD-mFc and S trimer proteins and pseudovirus were employed to further confirm the antigen-binding and neutralizing ability of 2G1. Antibody 2G1 bound to RBD-mFc and S trimer with EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.016 μg/mL and 0.135 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>) and neutralized WA1/2020 pseudovirus with IC<sub>50</sub> 0.0031 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), in line with the results of previous screening. Affinity of monovalent 2G1 (Fab) to RBD was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Relatively moderate dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 2G1 to WA1/2020 RBD was determined as 1.05 × 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The rapid binding of 2G1 with association constant K<sub>a</sub> = 2.55 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ms<sup>-1</sup> offered a sub-nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) value of 0.41 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Next, the antibody 2G1 was moved to further characterization including <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activities as well as structural and mechanism investigation.</p>

<p id="P7">With the continuing spread of mutations, combating SARS-CoV-2 variants has become a crucial task. We explored the effects of 2G1 on the mutations at several important sites such as N439K, Y453F, E484K and N501Y in terms of blocking the ACE2-RBD interaction. The IC<sub>50</sub> of 2G1 blocking WA1/2020 RBD, N439K, Y453F, E484K and N501Y interacting with ACE2 were 0.1504, 0.1050, 0.2225, 0.1951 and 0.1672 μg/mL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To further study the S mutants of VOCs influence on blocking ability of 2G1, mutant trimeric S proteins of VOCs were used in ACE2 blocking experiment. The IC<sub>50</sub> of 2G1 were 0.0821, 0.1066, 0.1074, 0.1047, and 0.7973 μg/mL, corresponding to WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We determined the affinities of 2G1 with various S trimers using SPR. 2G1 Fab bound to S trimers with nanomolar affinities. K<sub>D</sub> of its binding to WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, and Delta were 1.02, 0.86, 2.77, 2.30, 1.04, and 15.30 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The dissociation rate of 2G1/Delta (K<sub>d</sub> = 4.27 × 10<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) was increased as compared with WA1/2020 (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.05 × 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), which leads to the decrease in affinity.</p>
<p id="P8">In pseudovirus neutralization assays, we found that antibody 2G1 robustly neutralized all pseudoviruses, including D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Cluster 5 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S3</xref>) with low IC<sub>50</sub>, especially 0.0005 μg/mL against Gamma and 0.0002 μg/mL against Cluster 5. Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay results were consistent with those from experiments using pseudoviruses. Antibody 2G1 neutralized WA1/2020 live virus with IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0240 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) while it was more inclined to neutralize Alpha, Beta, and Gamma live virus, with IC<sub>50</sub> decrease about 1.7-fold (0.0138 μg/mL), 5.2-fold (0.0046 μg/mL), and 3.0-fold (0.0079 μg/mL). In this assay, 2G1 had the same neutralizing activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.0240 μg/mL) against Delta and WA1/2020.</p>

<italic>In vivo</italic> protection in animal models</title>
<p id="P9">To evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral efficacy of 2G1 against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, we performed viral clearance assay employing both ACE2 transgenic mouse and rhesus macaque models. In the transgenic mouse study, animals were challenged with high copies of 100 times of half lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Beta, or Delta at day 0, followed by three different 2G1 dose treatments (20, 6.7 or 2.2 mg/kg) or vehicle injection (PBS). Four days post infection (dpi), four mice in each group including vehicle and differentially treated groups were euthanized, and lungs and brains were collected for the titration of viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Mice treated with vehicle developed an acute wasting syndrome and quickly met the designed endpoint at 5 dpi. In contrast, WA1/2020 and Beta virus-infected mice that received 20, 6.7 or 2.2 mg/kg treatments survived without losing any weight or revealing any obvious signs of illness throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-d</xref>). Delta virus-infected mice in the 20 mg/kg group all survived throughout the trial period and had a good clinical wellbeing score. In the same study, 55.6% mice in the 6.7 mg/kg group and 10% mice in the 2.2 mg/kg group recovered back to healthy physiological condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-d</xref>) from the virus challenge. The results indicated that at the range of 6.7 - 20 mg/kg 2G1 antibody treatment was effective for animals to recover from the viral infection.</p>
<p id="P10">In the study of rhesus macaque animal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), the animals were infected with 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV-WIV04) per animal and randomly divided into control (vehicle injection), low-dose (10 mg/kg of 2G1), and high-dose (50 mg/kg of 2G1) groups, with one male and one female in each group. Drugs were intravenously given 24 h post infection. All animals in the two therapy groups had a high viral load of 10<sup>6</sup> copies/mL in the throat swab at 1 dpi. After the drug injection, the viral titer was gradually decreased. The throat virus was cleared at 3 dpi in one of the high-dose animals and at 4 dpi in the remaining treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). One animal in the control group had an elevated viral titer in the anal swab at 5 dpi, but no animals in the antibody treated groups showed this trend until 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). In addition, we checked the viral distribution in lung, trachea, and bronchus tissues. The virus was detectable in most areas of the lungs, in the tracheas, and bronchi of the control animals. In the group treated with high-dose of the antibody, the virus was present in right-middle, left-middle, and left-lower of the lungs, as well as left-bronchi. In the low-dose group, the virus was only found in tracheas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Results from both transgenic mouse and rhesus macaque studies showed a promising protective efficacy of 2G1, in consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization results.</p>
<p id="P11">We further investigated the Fc effector function of 2G1. Results showed that 2G1 had no obvious antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect (not shown) but moderate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) up to 35% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S4a</xref>). We hypothesize that the moderate ADCP may help the antigen presentation of SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacokinetics (PK) study revealed the half-life of 2G1 in mice was 11.1 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S4b</xref>), similar to many therapeutic antibodies. Mice treated with 15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 60 mg/kg showed no statistical changes in body weight, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S4c-g</xref>). Mice received 2G1 treatment had no evident pathological changes in hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S5</xref>). Currently, Investigational New Drug-directed systematic safety assessment is ongoing to support the pre-clinical safety of using 2G1 in human clinical trials. Toxicology study in non-human primate showed that 2G1 was well tolerated at the maximum experimented dosage of 200 mg/kg.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the complex between 2G1 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein</title>
<p id="P12">To investigate the binding mode of antibody 2G1 on S trimer, we solved the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 2G1 in complex with S trimer at 2.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information, Fig. S6-7</xref>). Yet, the cryo-EM map density on the interface between RBD and 2G1 were smeared. So, we performed local refinement and improved the antibody-antigen interface resolution to 3.2Å, enabling reliable analysis of the interactions between the RBD and 2G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In the S/2G1 complex, three solved Fabs bound to trimeric S with all RBDs in the “down” position and the S protein in a locked conformation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). There is an additional density in RBD domain of the structure, which was reported as free fatty acid linoleic acid (LA) in a locked conformation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P13">For detailed analysis of the interface, antibody 2G1 binds to tip area of RBD of S trimer, overlapping with the ACE2 binding site on RBD and offset from the major mutational hotspots in VOCs. The heavy chain of 2G1 interacts with RBD mainly through three complementarity-determining regions, named CDRH1 (residues 30 to 35), CDRH2 (residues 50 to 65), and CDRH3 (residues 98 to 111). The light chain of 2G1 participates interaction mainly through two CDRs, CDRL1 (residues 23 to 36) and CDRL3 (residues 91 to 100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b-e</xref>). The interface between RBD and 2G1 is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic interaction network. Phe486 on the RBD top loop interacts with Tyr33, Tyr52 on heavy chain and Tyr34, Tyr93, Trp99 on light chain through hydrophobic and/or π-π interactions simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). CDRH1 and CDRH3 of the 2G1 heavy chain were positioned above the LA binding pocket in the adjacent RBD’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b and 7e</xref>). We further compared 2G1 with three antibodies (S2E12, B1-182.1 and REGN10933), which have similar patterns of epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a-c</xref>). Structural comparison reveals that the epitope for 2G1 partially overlaps with these three antibodies (S2E12, B1-182.1 and REGN10933), but they have different binding directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Besides, 2G1 has a relative narrow binding epitope which may result less probability of losing neutralizing activity due to viral mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>).</p>

<title>Potential escape risk evaluation</title>
<p id="P14">To address the potential virus escape issue, we collected the high-frequency mutation sites near the 2G1 binding epitope from GISAID database as of August 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9a</xref>), and constructed a series of S protein sequences containing these mutations. The change in binding ability of 2G1 was reflected by the normalized mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) relative to the wild-type S protein in flow cytometry. Mutants 484K, 477N/484Q/490S, and 477R/478K/484K distinctly reduced 2G1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>). Mutants 477N/490S, 477R/490S, 478K/484Q, and 484K/490S remarkably enhanced 2G1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>). The 484K substitution is featured in variants Beta and Gamma. Although 484K alone leads to a decreased binding ability of 2G1, trimeric S harbor all mutation sites only slightly influenced the affinity of 2G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The 484K substitution leads to the loss of salt bridge between Glu484 and ACE2 Lys31, resulting in the reduced affinity of ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. It may be one of the reasons why the activity of 2G1 even slightly improved in neutralizing Beta and Gamma mutants. Another substitution in residue 484 with Gln (484Q) only slightly weakened the binding of 2G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant possesses the T478K substitution, which is a contact residue with 2G1. The single point mutation with T478K has mildly decreased the 2G1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>), which is consistent with the SPR data.</p>
<p id="P15">We also directly mutated the key interacting residues between RBD and 2G1 by alanine substitution, though they are not high-frequency mutation sites. Only moderate decline in 2G1 interaction was found in several mutations, including 486A, 489A, 477A/487A, and 477A/489A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9c</xref>). These results suggest that 2G1 could potentially be effective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P16">SARS-CoV-2 has no sign of stopping its transmission since the outbreak, and the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility and capability of surveillance escape has assisted its continued existence. Recently, the variant Delta has become an intensively concerned strain due to its unparalleled transmissibility, which is embodied in the 1000 times higher viral load than the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. The high-frequency mutation nature of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the development of therapies with breadth<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. We screened antibodies with broad spectrum of neutralizing effects from convalescent subjects. One of which, 2G1, showed excellent and extensive neutralization to both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 and VOCs at sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> level. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, transgenic mice infected by the WA1/2020- and Beta- were cured by antibody 2G1 at a dose as low as 2.2 mg/kg, as well as fully protected from Delta infection in the range from 6.7 to 20 mg/kg, even when animals were challenged with 100 times LD<sub>50</sub> of viral load. These results indicate that 2G1 is a potent therapeutic antibody against the broad spectrum of variants currently being concerned.</p>
<p id="P17">The cryo-EM structure of 2G1 in complex with the S protein revealed that 2G1 binds to the tip of S trimer through small interface but strong hydrophobic effect. The strong hydrophobic effect provides high affinity for 2G1, and the K<sub>D</sub> of interaction with S trimers of SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs ranges from 0.86 nM to 15.3 nM. SARS-CoV-2 variants Beta and Gamma possess E484K and N501Y substitutions, which are adjacent to the epitope of 2G1. We correspondingly detected a slight decrease in the affinity of 2G1, from 1.02 nM for WA1/2020 to 2.77 nM for Beta and 2.30 nM for Gamma. Surprisingly, 2G1 showed no compromise in activity against Beta and Gamma in both pseudo- and live- viruses, and both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The dose of 2.2 mg/kg of 2G1 completely cleared the viral load in Beta virus challenged transgenic mice, and the efficacy of which was as good as for WA1/2020 virus challenged mice. The IC<sub>50</sub> even improved in the <italic>in vitro</italic> live virus test, decreased from 0.0240 μg/mL against WA1/2020 to 0.0046 μg/mL against Beta and 0.0079 μg/mL against Gamma. These results suggest that changes in affinity may not ultimately determine the therapeutic effect of neutralizing antibodies, and various other factors could be involved<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the small binding epitope reduces the probability of interference between 2G1 and other RBD antibodies so that 2G1 can cooperatively work with those antibodies to achieve a synergistic effect, for better responding to immunologic evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
<p id="P18">Furthermore, the specific 2G1 antibody epitope of RBD tip is offset from mutational hot spots and increases neutralization breadth covering new-onset VOCs. Variants Lambda comprising L452Q/F490S and Mu comprising E484K/N501Y in RBD have recently raised concerns<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Although residue 490 is nearing 2G1 epitope, our results suggested that F490S did not cause significant affinity alteration. The E484K/N501Y substitution in variant Mu is also seen in Beta and Gamma. In view of the good binding and neutralization of 2G1 against Beta and Gamma, we believe that 2G1 will likely be comparatively effective against Mu. In addition, we directly mutated the amino acid residues adjacent to the epitope on RBD by 2G1, as well as several residues that directly interact with 2G1, and found that only few mutation groups may cause a significant weakening of the 2G1 binding ability. Collectively, the model of 2G1 binding to the tip of S trimer provides a good reference for developing vaccines and optimizing a better combination therapy.</p>
<p id="P19">The neutralizing antibody 2G1 has been manufactured under cGMP to support the Investigational New Drug application. We would believe that antibody treatment with 2G1 will bring clinical benefit to COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p id="P35">This recombinant S protein was overexpressed using the HEK 293F mammalian cells (Invitrogen) at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a Multitron-Pro shaker (Infors, 130 rpm). For secreted S protein production, about 1.5 mg of the plasmid was premixed with 3 mg of polyethylenimines (PEIs) (Polysciences) in 50 mL of fresh medium for 15 mins before adding to cell culture, and transiently transfected into the cells, when the cell density reached 2.0 ×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 4000×g for 15 mins and cell culture supernatant was collected sixty hours after transfection. The secreted S proteins were purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma Aldrich). After loading two times, the anti-FLAG M2 resin was washed with the wash buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with the wash buffer plus 0.2 mg/mL flag peptide. The eluent was then concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were collected and concentrated to incubate with mAb. The purified S protein was mixed with the 2G1 at a molar ratio of about 1:5 for one hour, respectively.
