<abstract>
<p id="P1">Therapeutic inhibition of critical viral functions is important for curtailing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to identify antiviral targets through genome-wide characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are crucial for viral pathogenesis and that cause harmful cytopathic effects. All twenty-nine viral proteins were tested in a fission yeast cell-based system using inducible gene expression. Twelve proteins including eight non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and four accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) were identified that altered cellular proliferation and integrity, and induced cell death. Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the twelve proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis, and caused activation of pro-inflammatory response with production of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β1, possibly through the activation of NF-κB. To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, △G188. Compared to wild type ORF3a, the △GI88 variant yielded more robust activation of cellular oxidative stress, cell death, and innate immune response. Since cellular oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to cell death and tissue damage linked to the severity of COVID-19, our findings suggest that ORF3a is a promising, novel therapeutic target against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is unprecedented in its rapid spread, persistence, and high fatality. Although current vaccines are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, breakthrough infections are not uncommon. Moreover, the emergence of new viral variants could undermine the effectiveness of current vaccines. Antiviral drugs are an alternative, potentially effective means to curtail COVID-19 but currently such drugs are limited. The discovery of new antiviral agents is hampered by limited knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus and of which viral protein(s) should be targeted. There is an urgent need to identify the viral proteins that cause harmful cytopathic effects, tissue damage, and cytokine storm, in order to advance the rational design of anti-COVID-19 therapies.</p>
<p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to sarbecoviruses, a subgenus of β-coronaviridae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). It is one of the 7 human coronaviruses (hCoVs) that cause human diseases that range from the common cold to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Like other hCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense (+), single-stranded RNA virus with an average genome size of 29.7kb. Upon viral entry into a host cell, the (+)ssRNA viral genome is released into the cytoplasm where the two overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a and ORF1b) are translated to produce two polyproteins, which are further processed by viral proteases to generate a total of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins including 4 structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1 - NSP16), and 9 accessary ORFs (3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b,9c and 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Among them, ORF3a, ORF8, ORF9c and ORF10 are unique to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">We carried out a genome-wide functional screening of CoV-2 proteins to identify viral targets that can be used for antiviral drug discovery and testing. We reasoned that SARS-CoV-2 protein therapeutic targets: i) should be essential for virus survival; ii) should contribute to virus pathogenesis; iii) should confer measurable cytopathic effects that could be used as endpoints for high-throughput drug screening; iv) could be either an established or a novel antiviral drug target. We adapted a unique integrated approach, <italic>viz.,</italic> a well-established fission yeast cell-based system to conduct genome-wide and functional analyses of the viral proteins, with the goal of identifying proteins that cause harmful cytopathic effects. Fission yeast <italic>(Schizosaccharomyces pombe)</italic> is a haploid single-cell eukaryotic organism that has been used extensively as a model to study human cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Fission yeast is a well-tested model system for the study of highly conserved cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) such as the cytopathic effects caused by viral proteins, including inhibition of cell proliferation, interruption of cell structural integrity, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Fission yeast cell-based systems also have been shown to be suitable for antiviral drug testing and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">A total of 29 viral ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) representing the entire viral genome were cloned into the fission yeast gene expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Expression of each viral ORF was under the control of an inducible <italic>nmt</italic>1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), allowing all SARS-CoV-2-specific viral protein effects to be measured specifically by gene induction <italic>vs.</italic> without gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Using this unique integrated strategy, we report the identification of multiple possible viral therapeutic targets with a detailed description, as a proof-of-concept, of ORF3a. We demonstrate the potential of ORF3a to serve as a therapeutic target for the discovery and testing of antiviral drugs against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Identification of SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins that prevent cellular proliferation and colony formation of fission yeast</title>
<p id="P6">A total of 29 viral ORFs representing all viral proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were expressed using inducible <italic>nmt</italic>1 promoter-mediated transcription in a wild type fission yeast strain SP223. Fission yeast cells expressing an empty cloning plasmid pYZ1N were used as a cloning vector (Vec) control. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 protein expression on the ability of fission yeast to form colonies, an indication of cell proliferation, was measured on minimal selective agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). All cells with viral genes repressed (<italic>gene</italic>-off) formed normal size colonies on the agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). In contrast, 8 non-structural viral protein-producing fission yeast cells (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and 4 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) showed either complete inhibition or near complete inhibition of yeast colony formation on minimal selective agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In each case, either no colony or very small colonies were observed under viral gene-inducing conditions, consistent with cellular growth inhibition. With the Vec control, normal size colonies were observed on both gene-suppressing (<italic>gene</italic>-off) and gene-inducing (<italic>gene</italic>-on) plates, confirming the specificity of the viral protein effect observed. We named the 12 viral proteins the “cytopathic proteins”. Production of the remaining 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins showed either no effect or reduced effect on the fission yeast colony formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">To verify the effect of the 12 cytopathic proteins on cell proliferation, we measured the growth kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2-carrying fission yeast cells. Fission yeast cells were grown under the <italic>gene</italic>-off and <italic>gene</italic>-on conditions in the liquid minimal and selective EMM medium. Cellular growth was measured by the change in cell concentration over 48 h after gene induction <italic>(agi)</italic> using optical density (OD<sub>650</sub>)-based measurements. In the Vec only control cultures, two indistinguishable growth curves with typical logarithmic kinetics were observed in the <italic>gene</italic>-off and <italic>gene</italic>-on pYZ1N-carrying yeast cells. In contrast, expression of NSP1, NSP4, NSP6, NSP13, ORF3a, ORF6, or ORF7a completely blocked cellular growth, whereas expression of NSP3, NSP5, NSP14, NSP15 or ORF7b significantly suppressed cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). During the first 24 h <italic>agi</italic>, both the SARS-CoV-2 <italic>gene</italic>-off and <italic>gene</italic>-on cells grew at about the same rate, consistent with 16 h being required to fully produce a protein after induction of genes under control of the <italic>nmt</italic>1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, thereafter, growth of cells expressing the 12 viral proteins stopped or slowed compared to that of cells without viral gene expression. Consistent with the data on colony formation, the production of the remaining 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins showed either no effect or reduced effect on fission yeast cellular growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins induce fission yeast cell morphologic changes and hypertrophy</title>
<p id="P8">Changes in cell morphology such as hypertrophy are linked to SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in human airway epithelial cells and myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). To determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins affect cell morphogenesis, we compared microscopic cell morphologies between fission yeast cells with or without viral protein production. Control cells containing the Vec-carrying plasmid appeared normal under both gene-suppressing and gene-inducing conditions. Cells were typical rod-shaped with diameters of 3–4 μM and lengths of 7–14 μM. They were shiny on the edges, a sign of healthy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Normal cell morphologies also were observed in cells that carried the 12 cytopathic protein-encoding plasmids under the gene-suppressing conditions. In contrast, expression of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins under the gene-inducing conditions resulted in various degrees of hypertrophic morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom rows of each panel). The common features of the abnormal cell morphologies included cell elongation and enlargement. We further analyzed the overall changes in cell morphology caused by the 12 cytopathic proteins. Both the forward-scattered light (FSC) and side-scattered light (SSC) were measured for each cell population of 10,000 cells using flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The FSC is relative to the cell surface area, and thus measures cell size. The SSC is related to cell granularity, and thus determines intracellular complexity. Combined analysis of FSC and SSC provide an overall architectures of cell shapes in a heterogeneous cell population. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, there were significant differences in the cells’ overall architectures between the <italic>gene</italic>-off and <italic>gene</italic>-on cultures of cells with cytopathic proteins. In contrast, there were no clear differences between the gene-inducing and gene-repressing Vec-carrying fission yeast cells, suggesting the observed morphological changes were SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific. The production of all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins did not induce clear cellular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). Together, our observations suggested that the 12 cytopathic proteins cause various degrees of cellular hypertrophy.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Correlation of SARS-COV-2 protein-induced cell death and induction of cellular oxidative stress in fission yeast</title>
<p id="P9">Since all 12 cytopathic proteins reduce or prevent cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and cause cellular morphologic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), these effects could be lethal. We tested whether the cytopathic proteins cause cell death. Inducible production of each viral protein was carried out as described above. Forty-eight hours <italic>agi</italic>, cell death was detected by Trypan blue, a vital diazo dye that specifically detects dead cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, all cytopathic proteins induced cell death in the range of 10–60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, blue bars). In contrast, most of the other SARS-CoV-2 proteins did not kill cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">We explored the mechanism of cell death caused by the cytopathic proteins. Because a cellular oxidative stress response can trigger cell death and is known to play an important role in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), we tested for intracellular oxidative stress by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A ROS-specific dye, dihydroethidium (DHE) that produces red fluorescence in the presence of ROS, was used to measure the presence of ROS 48 h <italic>agi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Except NSP14, other cytopathic proteins triggered the induction of ROS as quantified and shown by the red bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These observations suggest that cell death induced by the cytopathic proteins, with the exception of NSP14, was at least partially attributable to the induction of intracellular oxidative stress.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are associated with the activation of mammalian cellular oxidative stress and immune pro-inflammatory responses</title>
<p id="P11">Of the identified cytopathic proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study because it plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and its activities are linked to lung tissue damage and a cytokine storm in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Since we found that ORF3a-induced cell death was associated with the induction of cellular oxidative stress in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), we tested whether a similar ORF3a effect is produced in mammalian cells, including human pulmonary epithelial A549, Calu-3 and kidney epithelial 293T cell lines. After transfection of the <italic>ORF3a</italic>-carrying plasmid into A549 and 293T cells, cell growth over time was measured, and cell viability and cell death were evaluated by the MTT method and trypan blue exclusion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>, the expression of <italic>ORF3a</italic> in either the A549 or the 293T cells significantly reduced cell growth, decreased cell viability, and increased cell death in comparison with the mock and the vector controls (Ctr). Possible effects of ORF3a-induced cell death <italic>via</italic> apoptosis or necrosis were evaluated by a RealTime Glo Annexin V Apoptosis and Necrosis assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-a-b</xref>, ORF3a-induced cell death involved both necrosis and apoptosis. ORF3a-induced apoptosis was mediated at least in part through the cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-c</xref>). In addition, the expression of <italic>ORF3a</italic> triggered a cellular oxidative stress response, as measured by DHE staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Our results suggest that ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis in mammalian cells are associated at least in part with the induction of a cellular oxidative stress response.</p>
<p id="P12">To test whether the induction of apoptosis and necrosis by ORF3a are related to a host cellular immune response, we measured the production of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their regulator, NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The mRNA levels of each gene target were measured over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Gene transcription of both TNF-α and IL-6 increased moderately in Calu-3 and 293T cells 72 h post-transfection (<italic>hpt</italic>). The level of NF-κB also increased slightly over time. These data suggest that ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis could also contribute to the activation of a cellular pro-inflammatory response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are affected by natural and artificial gene mutations</title>
<p id="P13">To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we tested the mutational effect of ORF3a on the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. A natural mutant variant (Q57H) that is associated with the ongoing Beta variant, and deletion of a highly conserved guanine residue (△G188) were tested. The △GI88 mutant was chosen because the amino acid (a.a.) 188 is highly conserved among sarbecoviruses, a subgenus of β-coronaviruses. G188 may be structurally important as it is one of the two guanidine resides that separate two antiparallel β4 and β5 sheets, and both residues are in the proximity of two homodimers of ORF3a and are within the inner cavity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The same methods as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) were used to measure cell growth, cell viability and apoptosis and necrosis with the ORF3a mutants. In comparison with wildtype ORF3a, the △G188 mutant showed significant differences in its effects including markedly reduced cellular growth, viability and increased cell death over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-a-c</xref>, red bars). In contract, the Q57H mutant showed slightly improved cellular growth, viability and reduced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-a-c</xref>, blue bars). Overall, the effects of the two ORF3a mutants on cellular growth and viability were inversely correlated with the effects on overall cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-c</xref>), apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Compared to wildtype ORF3a, the △G188 mutant markedly increased apoptosis and necrosis, whereas the Q57H mutant showed reduced apoptosis and necrosis. Consistent with the idea that ORF3a-induced cell death is mediated through the induction of cellular oxidative stress, a positive correlation also was seen between the wildtype and mutant ORF3a in the production of ROS (<bold>Fig. 6</bold>). Based on these observations, ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are likely mediated through the induction of cellular oxidative stress, and the overall structure of the ORF3a protein appears to be important for the induction of cell death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are correlated with the level of cellular pro-inflammatory response</title>
<p id="P14">Since ORF3a-induced cell death is associated with the activation of host cell pro-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), we tested whether the level of ORF3a-induced cell death is correlated with the level of the cellular pro-inflammatory response. Both Q57H and △G188 mutants were tested in comparison with the wildtype ORF3a. While the Q57H mutant showed a similar immune expression profile as the wildtype ORF3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-a</xref>, blue bars), sharp increases in TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB were observed with the △G188 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-a</xref>, red bars), suggesting a strong correlation between the level of apoptosis and necrosis induced by the △G188 mutant and the level of TNF-α, IL-6, or NF-κB. To further test whether other cytokines or pattern recognition receptors that recognize dsRNA virus also respond to the expression of ORF3a, we measure gene transcription of type I interferon beta-1 (IFN-β1), Toll-Like receptors 4 (TLR4) and Toll-Like receptors 3 (TLR3). Similar or slightly reduced activation of IFN-β1, TLR4 and TLR3 was observed in the Q57H mutant compared with the wildtype ORF3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-b</xref>), whereas sharp increases of IFN-β1, TLR4 and TLR3 were observed with the △G188 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-b</xref>). Interestingly, there were temporal differences in the activation of the various cytokines and regulators. The increase in TNF-α began as early as at 24 <italic>hpt</italic> and was significantly reduced at 72 <italic>hpt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-a</xref>). In contrast, no significant increase of signals of NF-κB or TLR4 or TLR3 was seen at 24 <italic>hpt,</italic> but mRNA production gradually increased from 48 to 72 <italic>hpt,</italic> suggesting these might be late events. The two type I interferons, IFN-β1 and IL-6, showed a significant spike at 48 <italic>hpt</italic>. These observations suggest that there is an active interaction between the expression of ORF3a and the host cellular innate immune responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">The goal of this study was to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral targets that can be used in high throughput drug screening and antiviral drug discovery. Our criteria for appropriate targets were that the viral protein must contribute to viral pathogenesis and cause measurable cytopathic effect that can be used in large-scale drug screening. Twelve viral proteins were identified that included 8 non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and 4 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b). Overall, they all inhibited cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), caused cellular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Two major types of viral proteins were identified, viral enzymes and viral proteins that participate in viral replication or transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Among the viral enzymes, NSP5 encodes the major 3C-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), NSP3 produces a minor papain-like protease (PL2<sup>pro</sup>), NSP13 encodes a viral helicase that unwinds duplex RNA or DNA with a 5’→3’ polarity, and NSP14 is a dual function enzyme with N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) and C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. All these viral enzymes are highly conserved among coronaviruses and are essential for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Therefore, they might be ideal targets for antiviral drug discovery. Notably, viral proteases are proven antiviral targets against HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Some of the FDA-approved HIV-1 and HCV protease inhibitor drugs inhibit 3CL<sup>pro</sup> or PL2<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Although no clinical benefit has yet been shown from using those repurposed drugs, they nevertheless indicate the potential of using protease inhibitor drugs in treating COVID-19. The successful development of the first protease inhibitor antiviral drug Paxlovid (PF-07321332) against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) attests this possibility. The fission yeast 3CL<sup>pro</sup> or PL2<sup>pro</sup> cell-based assays described here could conceivably be used for high-throughput screening and testing of future SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors. This is certainly feasible because our early study shows that all FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitor drugs suppress HIV-1 protease in the fission yeast cell-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). NSP13 also shows dNTPase and RNA 5’-triphosphatase activities besides its helicase activity. NSP13 is the most conserved coronaviral protein and it is essential for viral RNA transcription and replication. Therefore, it is another promising viral target for antiviral drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Three of the identified viral candidates (NSP3, NSP4 and NSP6) form a core protein complex that is responsible for the formation of virus-induced double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). DMVs are part of the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells that drives replication and transcription for virus reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The RTC formed by NSP3/4/6 in SARS-CoVs links the cytoplasmic membrane with the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to induce membrane curvature and form unique DMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In addition, NSP3/4/6 interacts with E, M and N proteins to facilitate viral assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Thus, interruption of the NSP3/4/6 protein complex and DMV formation could potentially be a critical viral target to inhibit viral replication and transcription.</p>
<p id="P18">ORF3a was chosen for mechanistic studies because it fulfills the pre-defined criteria as a potential therapeutic target. ORF3a is a multifunctional protein that has 275 a.a. (~31 kD) and presents as a homodimer or tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). It has 3 transmembrane regions that span halfway across the membrane and cytosol that are linked to multifunctionalities including virulence, infectivity, ion channel formation, and virus release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). ORF3a plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2-mediated viral pathogenesis, including induction of the inflammasome in damaged lung tissue, and initiation of cytokine storm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). High titers of anti-ORF3a antibody were found in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, suggesting its clinic significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Deletion or transcription knockdown of <italic>ORF3a</italic> from the SARS-CoV viral genome results in a major reduction of virus growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a is essential for viral replication in the absence of the E protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Consistent with our findings from the fission yeast studies, ORF3a prevented cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>), in part through the induction of cellular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). ORF3a-induced apoptosis has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). However, oxidative stress-induced cell death had not been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the viral protein(s) responsible for inducing cellular oxidative stress had not been identified. Here, we report for the first time that ORF3a not only induces ROS production leading to cellular oxidative stress, but this cellular stress response appears to be a common feature of all the viral proteins except NSP14 that link to cell death in fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, shown by arrows). Whether the activation of cellular oxidative stress also contributes to the death of human cells caused by other viral proteins besides ORF3a remains to be elucidated. Oxidative stress is a common cellular response to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Sustained viral infection leads to accumulation of the ROS in cells or tissues that may result in tissue damage and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that excessive ROS production is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage and contributes to the severity of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Therefore, targeting these viral targets could potentially help ease COVID-19. It is unclear at present why NSP14-induced cell death did not trigger a cellular oxidative stress response. One possible explanation is that it functions as an enzyme that is part of normal cellular activity.</p>
<p id="P20">ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis might also be attributed in part to the activation of a cellular pro-inflammatory response, as three of the common pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β1, were all elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Clinical studies suggest that high serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels are strong, independent predictors of patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), and that hyper-inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19 are a major cause of disease severity and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis might be one of the viral factors that contributes to the elevation of IL-6 and TNF-α observed in these patients. Our data show that elevated production of IL-6 and TNF-α could be mediated through NF-κB, a well-recognized master regulator that mediates cellular pro-inflammatory responses to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). In addition, TLR3 and TLR4 might also be involved in these elevations, as they are also activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Both TLR3 and TLR4 recognize dsRNA viruses and trigger antiviral production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 is a cell membrane receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and TLR3 resides on the endosomal membrane in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). TLR3 induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production through TRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>); whereas TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production is likely through NF-κB. Both TLR3 and TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the severity of the COVID-19. TLR4-mediated production of IL-6 and TNF-α is associated with the severity of COVID-19 in patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Inhibition of TLR3 by famotidine decreases IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) and reduces the risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and alleviates symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Both cellular inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the severity of the COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). In addition, ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are a highly conserved cellular response among yeast (this study), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Therefore, targeting ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis could be a promising antiviral strategy to fight against COVID-19. Fission yeast could potentially be used as a surrogate system for large-scale drug screening and testing of anti-ORF3a inhibitors.</p>
<p id="P21">The △G188 mutant triggered much stronger activation of the cellular oxidative stress and innate immune responses compared to wildtype ORF3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Early protein structural analysis suggests the G188 residue may be structurally important, as it is one of the two highly conserved guanidine resides among sarbecoviruses that separate two antiparallel β4 and β5 sheets, and both residues are in the proximity of two homodimers of ORF3a and are within the inner cavity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The △G188 mutant may interrupt the structure of the two antiparallel β4 and β5 sheets at the C-terminal end or the inner cavity where it affects ion channel activity or interaction of ORF3a with host cellular proteins. Structurally, the ORF3a activity has been linked to seven sequence motifs from the signal peptide (a.a. 1–15) of the N-terminus to a di-acidic motif (a.a. 171–173) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This is the first demonstration of the functional relevance of the G188 residue at the β4/β5 junction of the C-terminus of ORF3a in the activation of cellular stress, innate immune response, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Additional mutagenesis studies are needed to confirm our findings. One possible explanation for the stronger effect of the △G188 mutant comparted to wildtype is that the wildtype ORF3a effect might be restricted by a host restriction cellular protein(s) through direct protein-protein interaction as shown in other viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). If this is indeed the case, interruption of the ORF3a protein with the host restriction factor(s) by the △G188 mutation could releases the ORF3a resulting enhanced triggering of host cellular stress and innate immune response leading to stronger cell death. This scenario is further suggested by the fact that the wildtype ORF3a completely kills fission yeast cells but only partially kills human cells. Note that ORF3a-induced cell killing in fission yeast is not an artifact caused by protein overproduction, as viral proteins with similar molecular weight such as NSP8 and 17 other viral proteins did not cause cell killing, nor do they induce the ROS under the same experimental conditions. It would be of interest to identify the binding partner(s) of the ORF3a in human cells.</p>
<p id="P22">ORF3a mutations are associated with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and high mortality in patients with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). The Q57H mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) recently was found in the emerging Beta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), and the Q57H variant was suspected of contributing to a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Our data show that the Q57H mutant activities are comparable to the wildtype ORF3a regarding the induction of cellular oxidative stress, innate immune responses, and apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, our data cannot rule out the possibility that the Q57H mutant may have other effects on viral pathogenesis. For example, the Q57H mutant was predicted to bind S protein, whereas the wildtype does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). It would be of interest to test whether the Q57H mutant contributes to viral entry. A number of new ORF3a mutations were found to associate with the emergence of the new viral variants. It would be necessary to test the effect of those natural ORF3a variants on their interactions with host cellular stress and innate immune responses to better understand the role of ORF3a in COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P23">In summary, through genome-wide characterization, twelve viral proteins were identified to exert cytopathic effects. Since these viral proteins are essential for viral survival and contribute to viral pathogenesis, they could serve as therapeutic targets for future antiviral drug discovery. In accord with this, we demonstrated here that ORF3a induces apoptosis and necrosis through the activation of cellular oxidative stress and host innate immune pro-inflammatory responses. Since these ORF3a activities are linked to viral pathogenesis, disease progression and severity of COVID-19, it would be desirable to develop a fission yeast cell-based high throughput system to identify anti-ORF3a drugs to battle COVID-19.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
</caption>
<p>The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has claimed over 5 million lives with more than 250 million people infected world-wide. While vaccines are effective, the emergence of new viral variants could jeopardize vaccine protection. Antiviral drugs provide an alternative to battle against COVID-19. Our goal was to identify viral therapeutic targets that can be used in antiviral drug discovery. Utilizing a genome-wide functional analysis in a fission yeast cell-based system, we identified twelve viral candidates, including ORF3a, which cause cellular oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and necrosis that contribute to COVID-19. Our findings indicate that antiviral agents targeting ORF3a could greatly impact COVID-19.</p>

<p>Effect of SARS-CoV-2 expression on fission yeast colony formation. (<bold>A</bold>), cellular growth (<bold>B</bold>) and summary of the relative cellular growth (15%, red; 25% blue) of each of the SARS-CoV-2 protein-expressing cells (<bold>C</bold>). The name of each SARS-CoV-2 protein is labeled above each agar plate. An empty pYZ1N vector (Ctr) was used as a control. Gene-off, no SARS-CoV-2 protein production; gene-on, the specific SARS-CoV-2 protein production was induced by triggering the <italic>nmt</italic>1 promoter-mediated gene transcription. Fission yeast colony formation was measured by growing SARS-CoV-2 proteinexpressing fission yeast cells on the selective EMM agar plates and incubated at 30°C for 3–5 days before the pictures were taken. Cell proliferation analysis was carried out by comparing cellular growth between the SARS-CoV-2 protein-producing cells and the SARS-CoV-2 protein-suppressing cells over time. Cell growth was measured by spectrophotometry (OD<sub>650</sub>). Only the effect of those SARS-CoV-2 proteins that showed complete (NSP1, NSP4, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14, ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7a) or nearly complete (NSP3, NSP5 and NSP15) inhibition of yeast colony formation is shown in (<bold>A</bold>) and thereafter. Complete data on cell proliferation are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>.
