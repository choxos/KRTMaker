<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">Cellular global translation is often measured using ribosome profiling or quantitative mass spectrometry, but these methods do not provide direct information at the level of elongating nascent polypeptide chains (NPCs) and associated co-translational events. Here we describe pSNAP, a method for proteome-wide profiling of NPCs by affinity enrichment of puromycin- and stable isotope-labeled polypeptides. pSNAP does not require ribosome purification and/or chemical reaction, and captures <italic>bona fide</italic> NPCs that characteristically exhibit protein N-terminus-biased positions. We applied pSNAP to evaluate the effect of silmitasertib, a potential molecular therapy for cancer and COVID-19 patients, and revealed acute translational repression through casein kinase II and mTOR pathways. We also characterized modifications on NPCs and demonstrated that the combination of different types of modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of histone H1.5, can modulate interactions with ribosome-associated factors. Thus, pSNAP provides a framework for dissecting co-translational regulations on a proteome-wide scale.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Co-translational regulation, such as modifications of nascent polypeptide chains (NPCs) during translation, drives many aspects of cellular proteostasis, including protein folding, processing, subcellular targeting, and translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Collart and Weiss, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Schwarz and Beck, 2019</xref>). Therefore, monitoring co-translational events at the NPC level is crucial for understanding cellular proteome dynamics at the moment a peptide is born.</p>
<p id="P3">Current approaches for systematically profiling the newly synthesized proteome are mainly based on the capture of proteins metabolically labeled with stable isotope-labeled (SILAC) amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Klann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schwanhäusser et al., 2009</xref>) or bioorthogonal amino acids such as azidohomoalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eichelbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McShane et al., 2016</xref>). These methods allow us to profile mainly fully translated products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eichelbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McShane et al., 2016</xref>), but cannot enrich NPCs actively being elongated by ribosomes in action. In contrast, puromycin is an aminoacylated tRNA analog that can be incorporated at the C-termini of elongating NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aviner, 2020</xref>). Hence, puromycin labeling has been extensively used to monitor protein synthesis in many applications, including imaging and immunoblotting, and in various systems ranging from cell-free translation to cultured cells and whole animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aviner, 2020</xref>). However, the utility of puromycin or its derivatives for proteome-wide analysis of NPCs has been limited due to the need for complicated procedures, including ribosome purification by ultracentrifugation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aviner et al., 2013</xref>) and/or chemical labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Uchiyama et al., 2020</xref>) prior to affinity purification of NPCs. Furthermore, reliable detection of NPCs is often hampered by non-specific binding of high background pre-existing proteins to beads or resin during affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eichelbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Howden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">To overcome these limitations, we have developed a method that combines quantitative proteomics and dual pulse labeling with puromycin and SILAC amino acids, termed Puromycin- and SILAC labeling-based NAscent Polypeptidome profiling (pSNAP). We demonstrate the broad utility of the method by applying it to both HeLa cells and primary cells to characterize rapid translational changes as well as co-translational modifications such as protein N-terminal acetylation.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>pSNAP enables global profiling of nascent polypeptide chains</title>
<p id="P5">We reasoned that NPCs incorporating puromycin could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-puromycin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), thereby allowing for proteome-wide analysis of NPCs by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). We first confirmed that puromycin incorporation into proteins was translation-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and that no marked degradation of the puromycin-labeled proteins occurred during 2 hr treatment of HeLa cells with 10 μM puromycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We then tested a monoclonal antibody against puromycin (clone 12D10) and found that puromycylated proteins could be effectively immunoprecipitated when appropriate amounts of the antibody and input protein were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Based on these results, we used 15 μg antibodies per 250 μg protein input for subsequent immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments.</p>
<p id="P6">We next sought to profile individual NPCs with LC/MS/MS. For proof-of-concept, HeLa cells were pulse-labeled with a combination of puromycin and ‘heavy (H)’ amino acids (Arg’10’ and Lys’8’) for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As a control, cells were treated with only ‘medium-heavy (M)’ amino acids (Arg’4’ and Lys’4’) and puromycin was omitted. The use of ‘M’ and ‘H’ labeling enabled us to distinguish <italic>bona fide</italic> NPCs (H-labeled) from non-specific proteins [light (L)- or M-labeled]. As expected, H-labeled proteins were highly enriched in the IP sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c top</xref>) while pre-existing proteins were predominantly observed in the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c bottom</xref>). Overall, we observed high H/M ratios (≧2) for 70% of 2,619 quantified proteins with good reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), demonstrating that pSNAP can profile thousands of NPCs. In contrast, we observed low H/L ratios (&lt;1) for 62 % of the quantified proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>) due to the high background resulting from non-specific binding of pre-existing proteins (L) to beads. These results highlight the importance of pulse labeling with SILAC amino acids to differentiate NPCs and pre-existing proteins.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Proteins captured by pSNAP exhibit a signature of elongating nascent polypeptides</title>
<p id="P7">Ribosomes elongate NPCs from their amino (N-) terminal end to their carboxy (C-) terminal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e top</xref>). In line with this directionality, the positions of peptides with H/M≧2 clearly showed a bias towards the N-termini of the corresponding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e bottom</xref>), further supporting the enrichment of elongating NPCs. Notably, such a trend was not observed for less enriched peptides (i.e., H/M&lt;2) or input cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e bottom</xref>). In addition to HeLa cells, we applied pSNAP to mouse primary cortical cultures, which contains a mixture of brain cell types but are highly enriched for neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). pSNAP revealed the strong enrichment of peptides near the N-termini of proteins. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2b, c</xref>) and achieved highly sensitive detection of NPCs, including neuronal markers; NCAM1, FOXG1, and DCX, supporting the validity of the results in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We also quantified the differential NPC profiles between 5 and 14 days in vitro (DIV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2d-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), which overall reflected the known proteome dynamics during the neuronal development in vitro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Frese et al., 2017</xref>). For example, nascent proteins related to ‘synaptic vesicle cycle’ were overrepresented in DIV14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), consistent with the occurrence of synapse formation and maintenance after development. Collectively, these results indicate that pSNAP captures genuine NPCs and enables quantitative nascent proteome analysis.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Quantifying translational responses induced by a kinase inhibition</title>
<p id="P8">The ability to capture and quantify NPCs proteome-wide with high accuracy enables quantitative measurements of acute translational changes that allow cells to respond to specific stimuli. To illustrate this, we next applied pSNAP to characterize the global impact of a kinase inhibitor on cellular translation. We focused on casein kinase 2 (CK2) as it is ubiquitously expressed in all cells, and has been implicated in translational control through phosphorylation of specific eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gandin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lamper et al., 2020</xref>). However, the protein targets of translational regulation by CK2 remain unknown. Therefore, HeLa cells were pre-incubated with either DMSO or a specific CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib (also known as CX4945) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Siddiqui-Jain et al., 2010</xref>) for 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and then pulse-labeled with puromycin and SILAC amino acids for 2 hr in the presence of DMSO or silmitasertib, and processed as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>. H/M ratios in MS spectra represent the difference in production of NPCs between the two conditions (silmitasertib and DMSO treatments). We first confirmed that NPCs could be enriched: H- and M-labeled peptides both exhibited the trend of protein N-terminus-biased positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To understand the gene expression networks at the NPC level, we first asked whether in vitro CK2 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>) might be regulated translationally but found no evidence for that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). On the one hand, we found that CK2 inhibition led to marked repression of NPCs with a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif in their mRNAs (p = 5.7e-16), encoding for components of the translational machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). TOP mRNAs are well-known targets that are subject to selective translation through mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, CK2 may regulate the translation of TOP mRNAs in concert with mTORC1, in line with a previous report that CK2 enhances mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gandin et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, pSNAP revealed that the translation of specific subsets of proteins (e.g., RCOR1, RAE1, and RNPS1) was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Thus, our analysis uncovered acute translational responses to silmitasertib via the CK2 and mTOR pathways, which may contribute to further understanding of the mechanism of action of silmitasertib, a promising molecular therapy for several types of cancers (phase II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Siddiqui-Jain et al., 2010</xref>) as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bouhaddou et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Profiling modifications on nascent proteins</title>
<p id="P10">The present method not only enables the global profiling of NPCs, but also highlights the co-translationally regulated modifications of NPCs. Conventional proteomic approaches cannot resolve post- and co-translational modifications, and so the distribution of the two types of modifications within a protein goes undetected; yet the timing of modifications can be important for protein processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aksnes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Varland et al., 2015</xref>) such as folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Keshwani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kii et al., 2016</xref>). By detecting NPCs with their modification states, pSNAP can be particularly useful in revealing co-translational modifications. In the silmitasertib treatment experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), we found that CK2 inhibition led to decreased phosphorylation levels on nascent forms of known CK2 substrates, such as G3BP1 pS149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Reineke et al., 2017</xref>), HSP90AA1 pS231, and HSP90AB1 pS226, pS255 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mollapour and Neckers, 2012</xref>), while no marked change was observed at the NPC level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Hence, CK2 may act in close proximity to the ribosome to co-translationally phosphorylate nascent proteins, possibly regulating protein stability through phosphorylation of newly made proteins, as observed for XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>) and CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pankow et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Protein N-terminal (Nt) acetylation is one well-studied ‘co-translational’ modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aksnes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yeom et al., 2017</xref>); however, recent studies have revealed ‘post-translational’ Nt-acetylation on many transmembrane proteins and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yeom et al., 2017</xref>). While earlier N-terminomics studies identified thousands of protein Nt-acetylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Choudhary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yeom et al., 2017</xref>), it remains unclear whether these sites are co- or post-translationally modified. We thus sought to apply pSNAP to pinpoint co-translational Nt-acetylation sites with high accuracy. For this purpose, HeLa cells were treated with either CHX or DMSO for 2 hr in the presence of puromycin and corresponding SILAC amino acid pairs. By combining pSNAP with low pH strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Helbig et al., 2010</xref>), we enriched Nt-acetylated peptides that were eluted in the flow-through fraction and early in SCX fractionation due to the loss of positive charge at their N-terminal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We confirmed that the NPCs could be enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) and identified 298 unique protein Nt-acetylated sites that exhibited H/M (DMSO/CHX) ≧2 in at least one of the three replicates. Of note, beta-actin’s Nt-acetylation showed H/M&lt;1 in all replicates, indicating that it occurs post-translationally, in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drazic et al., 2018</xref>). To better understand acceptor sites for co-translational Nt-acetylation, we focused on amino acids at the second residue [next to the initiator methionine (iMet)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In accordance with the substrate specificity of major N-terminal acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aksnes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yeom et al., 2017</xref>), we observed a high prevalence of alanine and serine for Nt-acetylated NPCs whose iMet was cleaved (p&lt;0.01, v.s. amino acid frequency at the second residue of the human proteome), while the acidic amino acids (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) and phenylalanine were overrepresented in the iMet-retained and Nt-acetylated NPCs (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Hence, these specific amino acids at the N-termini might be key determinants in regulating a protein’s life and function at birth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Timms et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein N-terminal modifications on a nascent protein can modulate binding partners</title>
<p id="P12">Protein N-termini are hotspots for modifications during translation and thus can regulate co-translational events such as folding and degradation through interactions with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Collart and Weiss, 2020</xref>). We next sought to discover cross-talk between protein Nt-acetylation and other modifications on NPCs as the combination of different types of modifications confers additional specificity and combinatorial logic to protein interactions. We searched our dataset focusing on phosphorylation, which can function as a versatile switch to modulate protein interactions. We identified 134 phosphorylated peptides in the Nt-acetylation-enriched samples. Among them, we focused on phosphorylation at Ser19 of histone H1.5 (H1.5) co-occurring with protein Nt-acetylation within the same peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Peptide-level quantification of H-labeled peptides indicated that the Nt-acetylated form is a major nascent proteoform of H1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Such highly stoichiometric patterns of nascent Nt-acetylation were also seen for the 13 sites whose Nt-acetylated and its counterpart (unmodified) peptides were both quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), in marked contrast to the very low (median 0.02%) stoichiometry of lysine acetylation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To understand the role of the nascent modifications and their impacts on protein interactions, we performed peptide-based pulldown experiments on HeLa cell lysate using three distinct peptide probes that mimic 1) Nt-unmodified, 2) Nt-acetylated, or 3) Nt-acetylated and phosphorylated forms of H1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The peptide-based screen revealed proteins that differentially interacted with the specific peptide probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). One prominent example is a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (KLHL13, KLHL22, CUL3, BIRC6) that showed a robust interaction with the unmodified peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> left). Thus, Nt-unmodified H1.5 is likely to be degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which may explain why the Nt-unmodified H1.5 was markedly less abundant than the acetylated forms in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Accordingly, protein Nt-acetylation of H1.3 is protective against protein degradation, in line with the idea that Nt-acetylated mitochondrial proteins bearing inhibitor of apoptosis binding (IAP) motifs are shielded from the IAP family of E3 ubiquitin ligases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mueller et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the Nt-acetylated and phosphorylated version of the peptide preferentially bound a co-translational quality control factor PELOTA while disfavoring the interaction with a molecular chaperone HSPA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> right). PELOTA was shown to promote the dissociation of stalled ribosomes and the release of intact peptidyl-tRNA for ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pisareva et al., 2011</xref>); Thus, the nascent H1.5 phosphorylation in the N-terminal region may represent an additional ‘modification code’ to recruit PELOTA and to repel HSPA6 as a surveillance mechanism for aberrant nascent H1.5. In summary, pSNAP enables us to uncover modifications on NPCs that may represent a new layer of translational control, i.e., one shaped by nascent protein modifications.</p>

<title>Limitations of the method</title>
<p id="P14">While puromycin or its analogue has been used to analyze protein synthesis in many cell lines and model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aviner, 2020</xref>), it may also cause a secondary effect on cellular translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Marciano et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we therefore used a relatively low concentration of puromycin that did not affect cell viability or degradation of puromycylated proteins at least in HeLa cells, but further investigations would be required to characterize the mode of action of puromycin in detail. We demonstrated that pSNAP can be readily applicable to a cell line and primary-cultured cells, though further development will be needed for its application to in vivo systems. For example, the direct enrichment and proteomic analysis of puromycylated peptides digested from NPCs provides a signature of genuine NPCs, and would not require pulse SILAC labeling, which is not generally feasible in animals.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P15">The pSNAP approach presented here offers multiple advantages over currently available methods for capturing NPCs with co-translational modifications, a hidden layer in understanding translational regulations in cell biology, but are inaccessible by conventional ribosome profiling or proteomic approaches. The advantage of pSNAP lies in the use of dual pulse labeling. The incorporation of puromycin facilitates the enrichment of NPCs from a complex background, and in turn, the use of pulsed SILAC enables both protein quantification and the ability to discriminate nascent from pre-existing proteins. Moreover, the experimental workflow is simple in contrast to existing methods that involve ribosome purification using ultracentrifugation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aviner et al., 2013</xref>) and/or chemical labeling steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Uchiyama et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the method does not require special puromycin derivatives such as biotin-puromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aviner et al., 2013</xref>) or clickable puromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"> Forester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Uchiyama et al., 2020</xref>). Our results show that pSNAP can quantify changes in NPC levels in response to environmental cues, and is useful for characterizing co-translational modifications. It might also be employed in combination with biochemical enrichment techniques for specific modified forms of peptides/proteins. In addition, this method could be applied to identify the NPC interactome during translation since some proteins appear to form homo- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bertolini et al., 2021</xref>) or hetero- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kamenova et al., 2019</xref>) complexes in a co-translational manner.</p>

<title>HeLa cell culture and pulse labeling with puromycin and SILAC amino acids</title>
<p id="P16">HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) (FUJIFILM Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were grown to approximately 70–80% confluence and then used for experiments. For pulse labeling experiments, the cell culture medium was switched to arginine- and lysine-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 μM puromycin (FUJIFILM Wako), either “heavy” amino acids [0.398 mM L-(<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>)-arginine (Arg”10”) and 0.798 mM L-(<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>)-lysine (Lys”8”)] or “medium” amino acids [0.398 mM L-(<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>)-arginine (Arg”4”) and 0.798 mM L-(D<sub>4</sub>)-lysine (Lys”4”)] (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), and incubated for 2 hr as previously described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Imami et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Uchiyama et al., 2020</xref>). For the proof-of-concept experiment (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), HeLa cells were pulse-labeled with a combination of 10 μM puromycin and ‘heavy’ amino acids (Arg’10’ and Lys’8’) for 2 hr, while as control, cells were treated with only ‘medium-heavy’ amino acids (Arg’4’ and Lys’4’) and puromycin was omitted. To examine the degradation of puromycylated NPCs during puromycin labeling (related to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), HeLa cells were treated with 10 μM puromycin and either DMSO, 10 μM MG-132 (Chemscene) or 1 μM bortezomib (FUJIFILM Wako) for 15 min, 30 min, 60 min and 120 min. In the silmitasertib experiment (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), HeLa cells were pre-incubated with either DMSO or a CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib (MedChemExpress) (10 μM) for 10 min, and then pulse-labeled with puromycin for 2 hr in the presence of either DMSO (+;‘medium-heavy’ amino acids) or 10 μM silmitasertib (+;‘heavy’ amino acids). For the protein Nt-acetylation profiling (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), HeLa cells were pulse-labeled with puromycin for 2 hr in the presence of either 100 μg/mL CHX (FUJIFILM Wako) (+;‘medium-heavy’ amino acids) or DMSO (+;‘heavy’ amino acids). After pulse-labeling, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. Three independent experiments were performed in all proteomic studies. All cells were maintained in an incubator at 37°C under humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.</p>

<p id="P17">Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared as described with a few modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). In brief, cortices were dissected from postnatal day 0 (P0) mice. Cortical neurons were dissociated using neuron dissociation solutions (FUJIFILM Wako) and plated on 35 mm (DIV7 neuron pulse labeling) or 60 mm (DIV5 and DIV14 neuron pulse labelling) dishes coated with poly-L-lysine (Merck) at a density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> and 2x10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, in MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6% D-glucose (Merck), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Nacalai Tesque) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three hours after plating, the media was replaced by growth media consisting of Neurobasal-A medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B-27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Neurons were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO<sup>2</sup> until experiments. For pulse labeling experiments at 7 days in vitro (related to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and experiments to assess differential translations between 5 and 14 days in vitro (related to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), the cell culture medium was switched to arginine- and lysine-free Neurobasal-A medium (Research Institute for the Functional Peptides) supplemented with B-27 supplement, GlutaMAX, penicillin-streptomycin and either “heavy” amino acids or “medium-heavy” amino acids, and processed as described above. After pulse labeling, cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and directly lysed by using lysis buffer [100 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Merck)] and further centrifuged at 21,500 x g for 5 min at 4°C to get rid of the cell debris.

The protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 250 μg (in 250 μL) protein per sample was used for the following IP. For the silmitasertib treatment experiments (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), 125 μg protein inputs from ‘medium-heavy’- and ‘heavy’-labeled cells were combined (total 250 μg proteins). 62.6 μg Dynabeads<sup>™</sup> Protein G Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 15 μg anti-puromycin antibody (clone 12D10, Merck Millipore) per IP experiment were mixed in PBS-0.02% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with a conjugation buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl). To crosslink the beads and the antibodies, the beads were suspended in 5 mM bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, disodium salt (BS<sup>3</sup>, Wako FUJIFILM) in the conjugation buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. To quench the reaction, 50 mM (final concentration) Tris-HCl pH 7.5 was added and incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature. The antibody-conjugated beads were then rinsed with 0.02% PBS-T, PBS, and the lysis buffer. The antibody-conjugated beads were incubated with 250 μg protein input for 1 hr at 4°C with slow rotation. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the beads were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 850 mM NaCl. Puromycylated NPCs were eluted from the beads with 100 μL 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (FUJIFILM Wako), and the elution was repeated once more.

<title>Profiling nascent polypeptide chains by pSNAP.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>, Principle of the enrichment of NPCs with the pSNAP. <bold>b</bold>, Schematic representation of pSNAP workflow. HeLa cells are pulse labeled for 2 hr with a combination of 10 μM puromycin and heavy amino acids or with only medium-heavy amino acids. After IP of NPCs with anti-puromycin antibodies, NPCs are eluted with 0.15% TFA and digested into tryptic peptides. The resulting peptide sample is analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Heavy-to-medium (H/M) ratios represent the degree of enrichment of NPCs. <bold>c</bold>, Exemplary MS spectra for AAALEFLNR (STIP1) obtained with (top) and without (bottom) enrichment. The isotope clusters of the L, M, and H peaks correspond to non-specific proteins from the pre-existing proteome pool and from the ‘medium’-labeled proteins and ‘heavy’-labeled NPCs, respectively. <bold>d</bold>, Multi-scatter plots of log<sub>2</sub> H/M ratios from three independent experiments. <bold>e</bold>, pSNAP can enrich NPCs. (top) The ribosome elongates an NPC from its N-terminal end to the C-terminal end. Thus, positions of NPC-derived tryptic peptides are biased towards the N-termini of proteins. (bottom) Relative starting positions of identified peptides within proteins. The bars represent averaged values from three independent experiments.</p>

<title>Quantitative analysis of translational responses and co-translational phosphorylation.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>, Experimental design for global analysis of translational changes induced by a CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib (10 μM). <bold>b</bold>, A histogram of log<sub>2</sub> fold changes [H/M (silmitasertib/DMSO) ratios] of protein synthesis induced by silmitasertib. Averaged H/M ratios based on proteins quantified in at least two of the three replicates are shown. Results from individual replicates are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>. A subset of proteins whose mRNAs contain a TOP motif is shown in dark blue. CK2 substrates determined by an in vitro kinase reaction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>) are shown in orange. All quantified proteins are shown in black. The dashed lines indicate median values of the three groups (all, TOP motif, and CK2 substrates) The p-value was computed using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. <bold>c</bold>, Change of NPC and phosphorylation levels due to silmitasertib treatment versus DMSO treatment. The indicated phosphorylation sites of G3BP1, HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 are known CK2 substrates. Levels of the NPCs were quantified from NPC-derived unphosphorylated peptides. The bars represent averaged values from two or three replicates.</p>

<title>Characterization of protein Nt-acetylation and phosphorylation on nascent proteins</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>, Enrichment of Nt-acetylated peptides with SCX-based fractionation. The percentage of the number of protein Nt-acetylated peptides in all peptides identified in individual fractions is shown. The bars represent averaged values from three replicates. <bold>b</bold>, The amino acid frequency at the second residue next to iMet of acetylated protein N-termini based on the absence (pink) or presence (light green) of iMet. Only nascent proteins that showed H/M&gt;2 in at least one of the three replicates were considered. For comparison, the human proteome from the SwissProt protein database is shown. The p-value was computed using Fisher’s exact test. <bold>c</bold>, Representative MS/MS spectra of Ac-SETAPAETATPAPVEK (left) and Ac-SETAPAETATPAPVEKpSPAK (right) from histone H1.5. The insets show representative MS spectra of corresponding peptides and demonstrate that the protein Nt-acetylation and adjacent phosphorylation occurred on nascent H1.5. <bold>d</bold>, The comparison of H-labeled peptide intensities from Nt-acetylated (red), Nt-acetylated and phosphorylated (orange), and Nt-unmodified (grey) forms. <bold>e</bold>, Stoichiometry (%) of protein Nt-acetylation estimated based on intensities of H-labeled peptides from Nt-acetylated and counterpart (unmodified) forms. The bars represent averaged values from two or three replicates. <bold>f</bold>, Experimental design for peptide-pulldown assays using three different peptide probes. Nt-unmodified, Nt-acetylated, or Nt-acetylated and phosphorylated biotinylated peptides corresponding to amino acid residues from 2 to 22 (SETAPAETATPAPVEKSPAKK) of H1.5 were conjugated to streptavidin agarose resins. Beads were incubated with HeLa cell lysate, and eluted for LC/MS/MS analysis. <bold>g</bold>, Volcano plots from the pulldown assays of Nt-free vs Nt-acetylated peptides (left) and Nt-acetylated vs Nt-acetylated and phosphorylated peptides (right) are shown.</p>
