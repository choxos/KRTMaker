We exposed five groups of wild vervet monkeys to a novel food to investigate innovation of processing and consuming it. We report that immigrant males innovated in two groups, and an infant innovated in one group. In two other groups, immigrant males imported the innovation from their previous groups. We compared uptake between groups with respect to the initial innovator to examine the extent to which dispersing males could introduce an innovation into groups. Uptake of the novel food was faster in groups where immigrant males ate first rather than the infant. Younger individuals were more likely overall, and faster, to subsequently acquire the novel food. We also investigated the role of muzzle contact behaviour in information seeking around the novel food. Muzzle contacts decreased in frequency over repeated exposures to the novel food. Muzzle contacts were initiated the most by naïve individuals, high rankers and juveniles; and were targeted most towards knowledgeable individuals and high rankers, and the least towards infants. We highlight the potential importance of dispersers in rapidly exploiting novel resources among populations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">To thrive in rapidly changing environments, including those induced by humans, animals must respond quickly to relevant information about their surroundings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Climate change or human induced invasions of species novel to the area, as well as the introduction of human artefacts into the environment can affect different species in myriad ways, for example, bringing new threats, disruptions, competition, or novel resource opportunities. Adaptive behavioural responses to such changes can include effectively avoiding new predators, maintaining high competitive ability and exploiting novel resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. For long-lived species, fast, learned behavioural adaptations are crucial for survival when circumstances change too rapidly for genetic adaptation to suffice. Whilst transmission mechanisms of genetic adaptation are well-understood, our understanding of how behavioural adaptations arise and spread is murky, and the role of individual heterogeneity in a group remains underexplored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Research has identified two main classes of behavioural response to novel stimuli in animals. These are neophobia and exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Neophobia refers to the avoidance of novelty, which could expose individuals to risky situations such as entering unknown home ranges of predators or ingesting toxins. Neophobia is common in response to potential novel foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Exploration, on the other hand, involves behaviours that seek information about novel stimuli. Obtaining novel information directly from the environment requires overcoming neophobia and engaging in exploration, tendencies for which may vary between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. If this information is used, it can facilitate innovation. Kummer &amp; Goodall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] defined innovation as, “a solution to a novel problem, or a novel solution to an old one”, and “a new ecological discovery such as a food item not previously part of the group”. Behavioural innovations can therefore allow species with slow generational turnover to adapt their behaviour quickly to changing circumstances, for example to exploit a novel resource introduced into the current habitat (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]). To innovate, however, it is necessary to go beyond obtaining information through exploration. Individuals must interact with the environment in novel ways, either using novel behaviours with known environmental features, or performing familiar behaviours on novel aspects of the environment, which additionally requires behavioural plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This plasticity can also be highly variable, both between individuals of a species, and within individuals across time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Given the risks associated with novelty and innovation, it is likely only beneficial to innovate when necessary; and motivation based on physiological states of individuals is likely important in variation in innovation within species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Moreover, neophobia and motivation to innovate may vary over time according to an individual’s current needs, developmental status and transient environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. For example, innovation might be more likely in juveniles who may be less neophobic due to their need to learn about their environment before adulthood, or in dispersing individuals who need to find a new home territory. Accordingly, dispersing individuals may go through a transitory exploratory behavioural syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] at the time of dispersal making them more likely to innovate during that period. Greater behavioural flexibility (“…adaptive change in the behavior of an animal, in response to changes in the external or internal environment…”, including stopping or starting a behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]) is an important requisite for innovation and is apparent in both juvenile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and dispersing male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] vervet monkeys.</p><p id="P5">On the other hand, if innovative conspecifics or individuals that uniquely possess particular knowledge are present, individuals can save energy and avoid risks by learning socially from them. Indeed, many studies of diverse species in captivity have found that observing a conspecific eating a novel food reduces neophobic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. A study on wild jackdaws found the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and similarly, wild baboons with a ‘bold’ personality handled a novel food for longer after seeing a demonstrator do so (though ‘shy’ baboons did not) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Further investigation is required in the wild, since the risk for foraging animals to ingest toxins via unknown foods can be high, whilst this risk is diminished in captivity due to human feeding with edible food only. Indeed, captivity and increased exposure to human artefacts appear to increase exploration of novel objects in vervet monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], suggesting differences in risk taking due to familiarity with human provisions. In addition, individual differences, such as age or sex, of the demonstrating conspecifics may be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and more worked is needed on the topic. Moreover, in several species, dispersing individuals have been hypothesized to import information or behavioural innovations, upon immigration, into new groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. For example, one study reports an immigrant vervet monkey providing spatial knowledge to his new group of a remaining water hole, during a drought, in a neighbouring territory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Detailed work in capuchins suggests the involvement of immigrants in both creating and spreading innovations in social and foraging domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Male Japanese macaques have been suspected to transfer stone handling patterns between troops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. While these studies show that dispersing individuals might facilitate the spread of information at the population level, experimental evidence focusing on multiple groups is sparse, resulting in a small pool of evidence.</p><p id="P6">Within wild groups, animals can use social information to guide foraging decisions. Many social learning studies in primates have focused on visual access to information (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], and see review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]). However, for Cercopithecoid monkeys, detailed olfactory information, in a foraging context, may also be acquired through muzzle contact behaviour – the act of one individual bringing their muzzle into very close proximity with another’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Indeed, previous studies found that, whilst foraging, muzzle contacts were most commonly initiated by infants and juveniles towards adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], which supports their function in information acquisition as young animals are still learning about their dietary repertoire, and adults are likely the most reliable sources of information. Nord et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] also suggest that, due to the necessary close proximity, social tolerance may constrain information transmission in this modality, which can be affected by age, sex and rank. In the presence of novel resources, muzzle contacts may be useful to adults as well as youngsters. Experimental research into this mode of information transmission in the presence of a novel resource is now required.</p><p id="P7">Vervet monkeys (<italic>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</italic>) are a species that thrive in natural, urban and agricultural habitats, and are widely distributed throughout eastern sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Their diverse habitats, including those highly modified by humans, make them an ideal species in which to investigate adaptation to novel environmental conditions. They live in multi-male multi-female troops, with philopatric females, and males dispersing multiple times during their lives. Frequently dispersing males may serve as vectors of information between groups. In addition, if dispersal triggers an increase in exploratory behaviour, necessary to seek novelty in order to leave one group to join a new one, around the dispersal period they may also become more likely innovators in novel environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], potentially facilitating behavioural adaptation to diverse habitats across their geographical range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. In a previous study by our team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], in 2018, two groups (NH, KB) of wild vervet monkeys were provided with a novel food that required extraction (peanuts in shells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) before consumption. The aim of this initial study was to test whether vervet monkeys socially learned how to extract peanuts from their shells, and from whom they did learn. The results supported social transmission of the opening techniques used to extract peanuts, based on visual attention to demonstrators and that vervet monkeys socially learned the technique that yielded the highest observed payoff and that was demonstrated by higher-ranked individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Here, we replicated the same experimental paradigm in 2019 and 2020 in three more groups (AK, BD, LT) after some males from the initially studied groups dispersed to other studied groups. The aim was to investigate whether dispersing males could trigger the uptake of an innovation in their new groups. Specifically, we took advantage of natural dispersals of males from groups already accustomed to extracting and eating peanuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] into groups that never had. This endeavour afforded us the opportunity to also observe innovation, which subsequently inspired hypotheses about the potential role of dispersal in innovation, building upon the work of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Our observations of innovation are limited in number, but further testing of the hypotheses we propose as a result of our exploratory analysis that we present, may aid our understanding of animal innovation.</p><p id="P8">The present study addressed the following questions: First, 1a) Who innovated and how did it affect the extent to which the innovation was adopted by the group? We expected, when the innovators or initiators (in case of immigrant males importing the innovation) were adults rather than juveniles or infants, greater neophobia reduction and therefore faster and more widespread uptake of the novel food, in agreement with the three phases in the ontogeny of social learning in primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Next, to further our understanding of the uptake of innovations, we assessed 1b) whether socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, rank) of group members predicted their adoption of the innovation at the first exposure, and across all four exposures after the first eating event. We expected adoption of the innovation to be more likely in younger monkeys due to previous findings that juveniles take more risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], are less neophobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] and generally tend to learn faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] than adults.</p><p id="P9">Second, we experimentally investigated the function of muzzle contact behaviour in novel food information acquisition. Specifically, we tested 2a) the effects of the amount of exposure to the food (and therefore familiarity with it) and the number of monkeys eating it on the rate of muzzle contacts. We expected that the rate of muzzle contacts would decrease as monkeys had more exposures to peanuts, if there were many monkeys eating. This would provide evidence for the function of muzzle contact in obtaining novel food information, by showing the dependence of muzzle contact rate on individuals developing their own knowledge of it through more group exposures and through eating the food. We also analysed 2b) whether individuals’ knowledge of the food, and their age, sex and rank predicted initiating and being targets of muzzle contacts. We expected an effect of knowledge, specifically for naïve monkeys to initiate more, and knowledgeable monkeys to be targeted more, with muzzle contact being a medium to obtain information about what conspecifics are eating. When referring to knowledge we are referring to the individuals’ own knowledge acquired in this specific case that peanuts are a food source. We do not invoke any more complex cognitive skills such as inference of the knowledge of others beyond what is observable of a conspecific eating the novel food. As in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], we also expected effects of age, with juveniles more likely initiators and adults more likely targets, as these are the theoretically predicted directions of social information transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], under the rationale that adults should have the most reliable information. Given the close proximity required to initiate muzzle contacts, we also expected low ranked individuals to be less likely to initiate muzzle contacts, as they are tolerated by fewer group members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">We refer to the group AK differentially as AK<sub>19</sub> and AK<sub>20</sub>, representing their status in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as 40% of the group composition changed between years due to dispersals, deaths and changes in age categories (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and detailed description in Materials and Methods).</p><p id="P11">Across the experiment, a total of 81/164 vervet monkeys in all five groups, learned to successfully extract and eat peanuts during four exposures from each group’s first eating event (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">When presented with the novel food, multiple individuals (2-16 individuals) in all groups (except BD where the knowledgeable immigrant approached the box first and immediately started eating) approached the box, looked at the peanuts, and retreated without touching any (visual inspection; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>); and at least one group member (1-7 individuals) approached and handled, sniffed or nibbled the peanuts before rejecting them and retreating from the box (contact inspection; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><label>1a)</label><title>Who innovated and how did it affect the extent to which the innovation was adopted by the group?</title><p id="P13">When tested in 2018, in NH, a naïve immigrant male, <italic>Avo</italic>, was the third monkey to approach the box, and innovated extracting and eating peanuts during the group’s first exposure to the novel food.

We found evidence of immigrant males as fast innovators, and as potential vectors of information between groups. We observed faster uptake of the innovation in groups when new immigrant males, rather than infants or juveniles, ate first. We found effects of age and rank on uptake of the food, both during the first exposure, and over four exposures, with juveniles and high-rankers eating the novel food more readily than adults and low-rankers. Furthermore, as groups had more exposures to the food, if many monkeys had started to eat peanuts and olfactory contact with novel food increased, the rate of muzzle contacts decreased. Initiating muzzle contacts was influenced by prior knowledge of the food, age and rank, and being targeted by muzzle contacts was influenced by knowledge and age. Below we discuss the contributions of these results to perspectives on the potential value of dispersing individuals in the innovation and transmission of behavioural adaptations to novel circumstances within populations.</p><sec id="S8"><label>1a)</label><title>Who innovated and how did it affect the extent to which the innovation was adopted by the group?</title><p id="P24">In the two groups where innovation occurred at the first exposure to peanuts (LT and NH), immigrant males, each with less than three months tenure in the group, were the innovators. In KB, an infant innovated, but only at their group’s third exposure to the novel food. Fast innovation (i.e. at the first exposure) to exploit a novel resource by new immigrants could be linked to a physiological state related to dispersal but we remain cautious here as our N = 2. In the first exposure in AK<sub>19</sub> there was a relatively new male, <italic>Boc</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), who had immigrated within four months, but he was very old (&gt; 12 years old) and had recently become very inactive. <italic>Boc</italic> disappeared, presumably due to natural death, two months after AK<sub>19</sub>’s exposure to peanuts. Such characteristics may counteract any effects of recent dispersal on exploratory tendencies. Indeed, very old age has been found to be related to declining boldness – a personality trait related to exploration – in big horn ewes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. In addition, the group did not show sustained interest for the peanuts, and after brief inspections of the contents of the box, started travelling away from the experiment area within five minutes from the start of the experiment.</p><p id="P25">Dispersal has previously been associated with exploration and boldness (i.e. low neophobia) in several taxa, with associated neurochemical variation, both within (ontogenetically) and between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Moreover, evidence links lower serotonergic activity with earlier dispersal in rhesus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], greater social impulsivity in vervet monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], and reduced harm avoidance in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]; all of which together relate low neophobia, or novelty seeking, with dispersal. Evidence does not however suggest that the dispersing sex in wild vervet monkeys are more bold or explorative overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], and in the present study long-term resident males did not show increased interest in the novel food. In another population, long-term resident males also showed reduced responses to novel foods compared to other age-sex classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. We suggest rather that the unique individual, social and environmental factors that prompt a male to disperse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] may trigger a transitory exploratory behavioural syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] that may subside again once males acquire more secure residency in a group. Since dispersal inherently involves heightened risk, periods of long-term residency would be well-served by a state characterised by reduced exploration and increased neophobia to balance costs of risk-taking over the lifetime. The large variation in risky predator inspection by adult male vervet monkeys, compared to adult females found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] also supports this. In the case of <italic>Boc</italic>, being likely near the end of his lifetime, this could also explain why he did not innovate, however further data are needed to understand whether this is a valid explanation or not. Future work focusing on the behaviour of dispersing individuals at multiple time points, both proximal and distal to dispersal events, in this species, and others, will help to more conclusively address this hypothesis. We highlight the need for researchers to consider the nuances of life-history characteristics beyond simply splitting by broad age-sex categories.</p><p id="P26">We found that when immigrant males were first to extract and eat a novel food in their new groups, during the first exposure to it in BD, LT and NH, and during the second exposure in AK<sub>20</sub>, other monkeys quickly followed them in doing so. As discussed above, two of these cases (LT, NH) involved innovation by the immigrant males, and in BD and AK<sub>20</sub>, the males had learned to extract and eat the food in their previous groups. In contrast, following innovation by the infant in KB at their third exposure, no other individuals followed in extracting and eating peanuts during that exposure. Over the three subsequent exposures that followed these initial eating events, very few monkeys started to extract and eat peanuts in KB, whereas in BD, LT and AK, where new immigrants ate first, large proportions of these groups learned to extract and eat peanuts. In NH however, this was not the case and is of great interest because though a new immigrant male innovated at the first exposure, he left the group before the second exposure. Closer inspection of our data revealed that only juveniles had started extracting and eating peanuts after the male in the first exposure and were thus the only knowledgeable individuals at the second exposure. Similarly, in KB, only juveniles ate after the infant innovated. Our interpretation of these results is that immigrant males were more effective in facilitating group members to overcome neophobia towards a novel food than infants or juveniles, which is in line with studies reporting age-biased social learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, in NH, more individuals did eventually start to eat during their fourth exposure, including a high-ranked adult female (after which the innovation spread rapidly, resulting in the data presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]). In NH, the juveniles eating at the beginning were older than the infants and one year old who started eating in KB. It is possible that age-bias is less strong for older juveniles since they should have more reliable knowledge than their very young counterparts. Alternatively, this difference between NH and KB could be because the juveniles eating earlier in NH were of high rank, whereas the infants and juveniles who began to eat in KB were of low rank. Indeed, rank-biased social learning has also been found in previous work in two groups (KB and NH) of this study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. It is nonetheless likely that various interactions of socioecological factors affect the influence of juveniles in overcoming food neophobia in the wild, and it still took repeated exposures before groupmates of the NH juveniles began eating.</p><p id="P27">Alternative explanations for these patterns of uptake, such as group habituation level to humans or the different experimental histories of each group (see STRANGE framework: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]), are unlikely. Indeed, in two groups with extensive experimental history (NH, AK), few individuals ate the novel food at their first exposure, whilst in the least habituated group (LT), with the most minimal experimental history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], a great proportion of individuals adopted the novel food at the first exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We hypothesise that observing new immigrants eat the novel food triggered groupmates to try it, rather than factors related to group idiosyncrasies that would be expected according to the STRANGE framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Moreover, whilst previous experiments suggested that high-ranked adult philopatric females are preferred over high-ranked adult males as models to learn from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], in the context of exploiting a novel resource, risk dynamics come into play. Adult females are likely to be the most risk averse age-sex category, due to the great potential negative impact of risks on their inclusive fitness, especially when young dependent offspring are present or whilst pregnant. This might limit their potential to discover new information that others can exploit. Under these conditions, adult males that are either in an exploratory dispersal state, or that enter a group with knowledge of resources previously unknown to the group (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]) may play important roles in generating and/or facilitating the spread of behavioural adaptations to exploit novel resources and face rapid environmental changes.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>1b)</label><title>Socio-demographic variation in the uptake of the novel food</title><p id="P29">Both, in the first exposure, and over four exposures, juveniles were more likely to eat than adults and infants. These results suggest that juveniles overcome neophobia faster, corresponding closely with results regarding risk-taking in another population of vervet monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, juvenile vervets have been found to learn faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], and work on other species suggests that juveniles are overall more exploratory and less neophobic than adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Taken together we propose that juveniles are, in general, more prone to taking risks around novelty, particularly when conspecifics provide social information. Moreover, alongside the results of section 1a, we propose that it could be adaptive that groups do not follow novel foraging information from juveniles as readily as adults (i.e. in NH), as this may limit the spread of potentially dangerous information acquired by exploratory but inexperienced juveniles. We also expect that infants were not more likely than adults to eat due to still being at least partly reliant on their mothers to learn their foraging repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] in contrast to juveniles who explore more independently.</p><p id="P30">Over four exposures, higher ranked individuals were significantly more likely to eat than lower ranked individuals, probably due to preferential access to the resource as it became more familiar and sought-after.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2a)</label><title>Muzzle contact frequency in groups</title><p id="P31">Muzzle contact rates decreased over repeated exposure to the novel food, providing some support for our hypothesis that the less muzzle contacts would occur when the food had become more familiar in each group. However, we expected this effect to be greatest when many monkeys were eating. Contrary to this, muzzle contact rates decreased more slowly when more monkeys were eating. This also makes sense, because more monkeys eating means more monkeys were in the area of the novel food, and therefore there were more opportunities to engage in muzzle contact. The steeper decrease in muzzle contact rate when fewer monkeys were eating also likely reflects that there were more muzzle contacts at the very beginning, when very few monkeys were eating, and the later exposures where very few monkeys were eating also gave rise to fewer opportunities for muzzle contacts. Cases where very few monkeys were eating in later exposures were due to KB and NH, where very few individuals started to eat over the four exposures time frame examined here, and the two exposures in BD (Expo. 4) and LT (Expo. 3) with only small portions of the group present. Nonetheless, the overall decrease in muzzle contact rate demonstrates the relevance of the behaviour in the context of an unknown foraging item, because as the monkeys became more familiar with it by eating it, they sought olfactory information from their conspecifics less frequently. This result concurs with findings from a similar study in wild olive baboons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. It could be argued that our conclusion regarding muzzle contact serving to acquire information is premature in absence of evidence that muzzle contact directly led to individuals eating. However, unlike in the context of observing and learning to use novel tools (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]), we do not expect muzzle contact to be a pre-requisite to learning to extract and eat peanuts. We argue that muzzle contacts need not be correlated with extracting peanuts in such a manner in order to support that they serve to acquire information. We provide further evidence to support this function below (section 2b).</p><p id="P32">That there were more muzzle contacts when more monkeys were eating could be interpreted that muzzle contacts are provoked by seeing conspecifics consume any food, regardless of its novelty. We have, however, used provisions of corn kernels in experiments for 10 years with this study population, and when presenting monkeys with this now familiar resource, we do not see rates of muzzle contact anywhere close to those observed during the early exposures in this experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. This is supported by the significant main effect of exposure number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2b)</label><title>Influence of knowledge of novel food and socio-demographic variation on muzzle contact behaviour</title><p id="P33">Muzzle contacts were initiated the most by individuals that had not yet extracted and eaten peanuts (hereafter, naïve individuals; opposite: knowledgeable), higher ranked individuals and juveniles. Contrastingly, muzzle contacts were targeted the most towards knowledgeable individuals, and the least towards infants. We find the most compelling evidence for our hypothesis of the function of muzzle contact in information acquisition in that naïve individuals initiated the most and knowledgeable individuals were targeted the most. We do not make claims related to knowing what others know, but rather we assume that seeing a group member eating an unknown resource prompts the initiation of muzzle contact towards that individual. Moreover, this result corroborates the finding in 2a) of decreasing muzzle contact frequency with increased exposure to and familiarity with the resource, and the overall function of muzzle contact in soliciting foraging information.</p><p id="P34">The effect of age on initiating muzzle contacts falls in line with the expected direction of information transfer from older to younger individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], with juveniles initiating the most (as also found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]). It also corroborates general findings regarding juveniles’ novelty seeking and faster learning (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]) as discussed above. However, that adults were not targeted significantly more than juveniles in this study (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]) is probably because juveniles were more likely to become knowledgeable of the novel food in this experiment (section 1b), and were therefore targeted more. This may seem contradictory to our assertion above, that individuals would adaptively not follow information from juveniles, however it is also possible that there is a critical mass effect, whereby when many individuals are already consuming a novel resource, juveniles may become valid sources of information. This is, however, beyond the scope of the present study, but requires further investigation. Furthermore, that infants were targeted the least does follow the direction of information transfer from older to younger individuals, and complements our finding that when an infant innovated, the innovation was not taken up widely in the group.</p><p id="P35">That high ranked individuals were more likely to be both initiators and targets is likely because, first, like juveniles they were far more likely to become knowledgeable, and second, because a high degree of tolerance is required by the target towards the initiator due to the close proximity in which this behaviour occurs (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]). Lower ranked individuals are not tolerated at the close proximity required to initiate muzzle contacts, especially around food resources; and they were much less likely to become knowledgeable, likely reducing their salience as targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P36">We add to the literature an experimental example of exploitation of a novel resource by multiple groups, facilitated here by dispersers. Our results provide evidence that dispersing individuals may promote the generation of new, environmentally relevant information and its spread around populations – a factor that has been largely overlooked, despite the known role of dispersal in gene flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. We urge future research to investigate what physiological mechanisms might exist underpinning a transitory dispersal syndrome characterised by heightened exploration and reduced neophobia that is triggered during, or triggers, dispersal. We studied a species with sex-biased dispersal and we open up the question of whether similar dynamics as suggested here might be at play in species where both sexes disperse, and whether dispersing females and males show similar levels of boldness during dispersal or not, due to different life-time risk mitigation strategies. Finally, we suggest further research, in diverse species, into whether dispersers transmit valuable information between groups, which can have major implications for population fitness, especially in the context of the rapid anthropogenic change that most animal populations now face. This study contributes novel insights into the roles of dispersers in wider behavioural ecology, which we hope will inspire and inform future work, spanning the disciplines of animal behaviour and cultural evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p id="P37">The study was conducted at the ‘Inkawu Vervet Project’ (IVP) in a 12000-hectares private game reserve: Mawana (28°00.327S, 031°12.348E) in KwaZulu Natal province, South Africa.

We also compared the AICs of the models with and without random effects and the lowest AICs were always those of the models with random effects, meaning that the models that fitted better to our data were those with random effects. Model assumptions were satisfied unless otherwise reported and adjustments made. Statistics were computed in R Studio (R version 4.0.3), and linear regression was done with the base R stats package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. GLMMs were done using the ‘lmerTest’ package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>].</p><p id="P55">All data and R scripts are made available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7376673">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7376673</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>All supplementary material referred to in text</label><media xlink:href="EMS150719-supplement-All_supplementary_material_referred_to_in_text.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d22aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (PP03P3_170624 and PP00P3 198913), the Branco Weiss Fellowship—Society in Science, granted to Erica van de Waal, and by the Fyssen Foundation and the Fondation des Treilles granted to Charlotte Canteloup.
