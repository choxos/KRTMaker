from ancestral 2019 SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, the ongoing pandemic is fueled by variants of concern (VOC) that threaten to escape vaccine-mediated protection. Here we show in a stringent hamster model that immunization using prototypic spike expressed from a potent YF17D viral vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) provides vigorous protection against infection with ancestral virus (B lineage) and VOC Alpha (B.1.1.7), however, is insufficient to provide maximum protection against the Beta (B.1.351) variant. To improve vaccine efficacy, we created a revised vaccine candidate that carries an evolved spike antigen. Vaccination of hamsters with this updated vaccine candidate provides full protection against intranasal challenge with all four VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) resulting in complete elimination of infectious virus from the lungs and a marked improvement in lung pathology. Vaccinated hamsters did also no longer transmit the Delta variant to non-vaccinated sentinels. Hamsters immunized with our modified vaccine candidate also mounted marked neutralizing antibody responses against the recently emerged Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, whereas the old vaccine employing prototypic spike failed to induce immunity to this antigenically distant virus. Overall, our data indicate that current first-generation COVID-19 vaccines need to be urgently updated to cover newly emerging VOCs to maintain vaccine efficacy and to impede virus spread at the community level.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>variants of concern (VOC)</kwd><kwd>vaccine efficacy</kwd><kwd>antigenic cartography</kwd><kwd>virus transmission</kwd><kwd>hamster model</kwd><kwd>second-generation vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a zoonosis likely from a limited number of spill-over events into the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Nevertheless, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is entirely driven by variants that evolved during subsequent large-scale human-to-human transmission. In particular, mutations within the viral spike protein are under continuous surveillance considering their role in viral pathogenesis and as target for virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb). Following early diversification, the D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1 lineage) became dominant in March 2020. Late 2020, Variants of Concern (VOC) emerged with increased transmissibility, potentially increased virulence and evidence for escape from naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This involved four VOCs harboring a unique set of partially convergent, partially unique spike mutations as compared to prototypic (Wuhan) or early European D614G (B.1) lineages of SARS-CoV-2, namely VOCs Alpha (B.1.1.7; N501Y D614G), Beta (B.1.351; K417N E484K N501Y D614G), Gamma (P.1; K417T E484K N501Y D614G) and Delta (B.1.617.2; K417T L452R T478K D614G P681R)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). N501Y was first detected in VOC Alpha and has been linked to an enhanced transmissibility due to an increased affinity for the human ACE-2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Subsequent emergence of E484K within this lineage hampers the activity of nAb suggestive for immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Likewise, a combination of K417N and E484K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) may explain a marked reduction in vaccine efficacy (VE) of some vaccines such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria) in clinical trials in South Africa during high prevalence of VOC Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Similarly, sera from vaccinees immunized with first-generation mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech, Cormirnaty; Moderna, mRNA-1273) or nanoparticle subunit vaccines (Novavax) showed a substantial drop in neutralizing capacity for VOC Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Furthermore, VOC Gamma harboring K417T and E484K emerged in regions of Brazil with high seroprevalence, so despite naturally acquired immunity against prototypic SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). VOC Delta was first identified in October 2020 in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage worldwide in 2021, driven by a substantially increased transmissibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In late November 2021, a new VOC Omicron (B.1.1.529) was discovered in southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and is since then spreading globally; displacing other strains at unprecedented speed. Omicron carries by far the largest number (&gt;32) of mutations, deletions, and insertions in its spike protein described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), including a combination of substitutions previously linked to increased human-to-human transmission (N501Y D614G P681H) as well as escape from antibody-mediated immunity (K417N E484A) acquired by natural exposure or elicited current vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). While the intrinsic pathogenic potential of Omicron remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), its antigenic divergence leads to a loss of activity of most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and failure of current first-generation vaccines to protect from infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The maintenance of some cross-protective nAb levels may require repeated booster dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine candidates in advanced clinical development are based on antigen sequences of early SARS-CoV-2 isolates that emerged in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We reported on a YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate using prototypic spike as vaccine antigen (YF-S0; S0) that had an outstanding preclinical efficacy against homologous challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, in the current study we demonstrate to what extent VE of S0, and hence first-generation spike vaccines in general, may decline when trialed against VOC in a stringent hamster model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Therefore, we designed a second-generation vaccine candidate (YF-S0*) by (<italic>i</italic>) modifying its antigen sequence to keep in pace with the evolving spike variant spectrum, in combination with (<italic>ii</italic>) a further stabilized protein conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This new S0* vaccine candidate provides full protection against all current VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Since Omicron does not cause a productive infection nor apparent pathology in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), levels of nAb which increased markedly after vaccination with S0* serve as proxy for an improved VE. Finally, hamsters vaccinated with S0* do no longer transmit the virus to non-vaccinated sentinels during close contact, even under conditions of prolonged co-housing and exposure to a high infectious dose of VOC Delta.</p><p id="P5">It is a challenging task to develop a universal vaccine that follows the evolution of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Omicron that carry increasingly complex combinations of old and new driver mutations responsible for both nAb escape (e.g., E484K/A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and enhanced transmission (e.g., N501Y; P681R/H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). However, our findings provide strong experimental support that first-generation COVID-19 vaccines need to be urgently adapted for VE against current and future VOCs fueling the ongoing pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>No change regarding VOC Alpha, yet markedly reduced efficacy of first-generation spike vaccine against VOC Beta</title><p id="P6">To assess VE of prototypic spike antigen against VOCs, hamsters were vaccinated twice with each 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of YF-S0 (S0) or sham at day 0 and 7 via the intraperitoneal route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Serological analysis at day 21 confirmed that 30/32 (94%) vaccinated hamsters had seroconverted to high levels of nAbs against prototypic SARS-CoV-2 with geometric mean titre (GMT) of 2.3 log<sub>10</sub> (95% CI 2.0-2.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Next, animals were challenged intranasally with 1x10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of either prototypic SARS-CoV-2, VOC Alpha or Beta as established and characterized before in the hamster model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). At day four after infection (4 dpi), viral replication was determined in lung tissue by qPCR and virus titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). In line with what was originally described for S0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), a marked reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus loads down to undetectable levels (up to 6 log10 reduction) was observed in the majority of animals challenged with either prototypic SARS-CoV-2 (8/10; 86% VE) or VOC Alpha (9/10; 88% VE). In those animals (2/10 and 1/10, respectively) that were not completely protected, virus loads were at least 100 times lower than in infected sham controls. By contrast and despite full immunization, S0 vaccination proved to be less effective against VOC Beta, with only 4/12 hamsters without detectable infectious virus (60% VE). Nonetheless, in the remaining 8/12 animals with breakthrough infection by VOC Beta, viral replication was tempered as vaccination still resulted in a 10 to 100-fold reduction in infectious virus titres relative to sham.</p><p id="P7">Logistic regression used to define immune correlates of protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) confirmed that comparable nAb levels were required for protection against prototypic SARS-CoV-2 (1.5 log<sub>10</sub> for 50% and 2.9 log<sub>10</sub> for 90% protection) and VOC Alpha (1.2 log<sub>10</sub> for 50% and 2.5 log<sub>10</sub> for 90% protection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Intriguingly, for VOC Beta a markedly (up to 25x) higher nAb threshold (2.6 log<sub>10</sub>) was required for 50% protection. Importantly, no 90% protective nAb threshold could be defined anymore for VOC Beta infection, considering the high number of S0-vaccinated animals with viral breakthrough (&gt;10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/100mg lung tissue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that first-generation vaccines employing prototypic spike as antigen may generally suffer from a markedly reduced efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as VOC Beta.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Updated spike antigen offers complete protection against full range of VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta</title><p id="P8">Although prototype S0 showed induction of high titres of nAb against prototypic SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and protective immunity against prototypic SARS-CoV-2 and VOC Alpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>), the prototypic spike antigen failed to induce consistent nAb responses against remaining VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Most importantly, YF-S0 vaccination resulted only in poor seroconversion and low nAb titres against VOC Beta (seroconversion rate 15/32; GMT 1.0 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI of 0.6-1.3;) and Gamma (19/32; GMT 1.3 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI 0.9-1.8). Intriguingly, human convalescent plasma used as benchmark (WHO standard NIBSC 20/130) originating from 2020 prior to the surge of VOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) showed a similar loss of activity against VOC Beta, in line with what we observed in our hamster sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">It is not clear if the full spectrum of antigenic variability of current VOCs and emerging variants can be covered by a COVID-19 vaccine that is based on a single antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In an attempt to generate a more universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (YF-S0*, S0*), we adapted the spike sequence in our original YF-S0 construct to include the full amino acid spectrum from VOC Gamma, plus three extra proline residues (A892P, A942P and V987P) to stabilize spike in a conformation favorable for immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). YF-S0* proved to be highly immunogenic against prototypic SARS-CoV-2, with nAb levels reaching GMT of 2.2 log<sub>10</sub> (95% CI 1.8-2.6) and a seroconversion rate of 21/24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), comparable to original YF-S0 (GMT 2.3 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI 2.0-2.6; 30/32 seroconversion rate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Also, for both constructs, seroconversion rates and nAb levels against VOC Delta were equally high (YF-S0: 30/32; GMT 2.0 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI 1.7-2.2; YF-S0*: 22/24; GMT 2.0 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI 1.6-2.3). Notably, for YF-S0*, nAb levels and seroconversion rates against VOC Beta (GMT 2.9 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI 2.6-3.2; seroconversion rate 23/24) and Gamma (GMT 3.0 log10, 95% CI 2.8-3.2; seroconversion rate 24/24) were markedly increased (by 50 to 80-fold for GMT; 1.7 to 2-times more frequent seroconversion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">S0*-vaccinated animals were subsequently challenged with each 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of either of the four VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta, and sacrificed 4 dpi for assessment of viral loads in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>) and associated lung pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). In S0*-vaccinated hamsters, viral RNA loads were uniformly reduced compared to matched sham controls by ~3 (VoC Delta) up to ~6 log<sub>10</sub> (VoC Gamma) depending on the respective challenge virus under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Importantly, no infectious virus could be detected anymore (~6 log<sub>10</sub> reduction) in any of the animals vaccinated with S0*, irrespective of which VOC they had been exposed to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), confirming 100% VE conferred by S0* against all four VOCs.</p><p id="P11">Protection from infection also translated in a markedly reduced pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). Non-vaccinated sham animals developed characteristic signs of bronchopneumonia with perivascular and peribronchial infiltrations, edema and consolidation of lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In contrast, lungs of S0*-vaccinated hamsters remained markedly less affected with a clear reduction in overall histological scores, irrespectively of the VOC used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). In conclusion, second-generation YF-S0* expressing an updated S0* antigen induced consistently high levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) which translated into efficient protection from lower respiratory tract infection and COVID-19-like pathology by a large spectrum of VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). VE of S0* covered VOCs Beta and Gamma, i.e. variants harbouring key mutations K417N/T and E484K escaping original spike-specific nAb activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), and may therefore also offer better protection against other emerging variants such as VOI Mu (E484K), or more recently VOC Omicron with similar signatures.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Blocking of VOC Delta transmission by single dose vaccination</title><p id="P12">VOC Delta is characterized by a particular efficient human-to-human transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). An added benefit of vaccination at the population level would hence be an efficient reduction in viral shedding and transmission by vaccinated people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), ideally from single-dose vaccination. For experimental assessment, two groups of hamsters (N=6 each) were either vaccinated once with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of S0* or sham (Sanchez-Felipe et al., 2021), and were intranasally infected three weeks later with a high dose comprising 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of VOC Delta to serve as index (donor) animals for direct contact transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). At 2 dpi, i.e. at onset of increasing viral loads and shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), index animals were each co-housed with one non-vaccinated sentinel for two consecutive days. At 4 dpi, index hamsters were sacrificed, and lungs were assessed for viral RNA, infectious virus and histopathology.

Importantly, only very low levels of viral RNA and no infectious virus was observed in non-vaccinated sentinels that had been co-housed with S0*-vaccinated donors. Also, lung pathology was reduced significantly in vaccinated index and co-housed sentinels as compared to sham vaccinated index and respective co-housed sentinels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). To our knowledge, this constitutes the first experimental evidence for full protection from SARS-CoV-2 transmission by any vaccine. The block conferred by S0* appears to be more complete than that observed in humans by current vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increased potency of new vaccine candidate S0* against Omicron variant</title><p id="P14">Immunogenicity of S0 and S0* was tested in parallel against VOC Omicron. Sera from hamsters vaccinated with updated S0* resulted in 60% (19/32) seroconversion to nAbs as compared to 4% (2/44) in those vaccinated with the prototypic S0 construct. Both vaccine candidates S0 and S0* were equally active against prototype (Kruskal- Wallis multiple groups; <italic>p</italic>= 0.79). Quantitatively, S0* resulted in a marked ~15-fold increase (p&lt;0.0001) in nAbs with activity against Omicron to log10 GMT of 1.2 (IQR 0-2.06), compared to S0 which resulted in hardly any nAb against Omicron (log<sub>10</sub> GMT of 0.09 log<sub>10</sub> IQR 0-0.09), confirming the substantial gain in immunogenicity for S0* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">This change in cross-reactivity of the sera raised by the original (YF-S0) and updated (YF-S0*) vaccine antigen against five different virus variants (prototype; VOCs Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron) was further studied using antigenic cartography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). VOC Alpha was not considered since it did not differ from the prototype virus, neither regarding VE of S0 nor nAb titre as correlate protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Specifically, we constructed a two-dimensional projection that geometrically maps median serum neutralization titres (SNT<sub>50</sub>) between sera and respective antigens as antigenic distances. This revealed a pattern of antigenic diversification between prototype virus on the one hand and VOCs Beta and Gamma on the other hand, with VOC Delta being mapped closer to the prototype virus as compared to Beta and Gamma. This is consistent with recently described patterns of convergent evolution in spike for VOCs Beta and Gamma, and Delta climbing a different fitness peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

Intriguingly, however, this obvious antigenic drift did not reduce the overall higher potency of S0*, which included equally strong humoral responses to prototypic spike and VOC Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, D</xref>). Likewise, despite being antigenically still largely divergent from other VOC (mean range: 0.8-3.3 units), antigenic distances regarding VOC Omicron were significantly shorter (t-test; p&lt;0.0001) for S0* sera compared to S0 sera (respectively mean ± SD; 5.5 ± 0.7 and 6.4 5 ± 0.5), in further support for the marked gain in Omicron-specific humoral immunity by S0* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Overall, these findings support the general observation that vaccines employing prototypic spike as antigen are losing serological coverage, in particular towards those VOCs (Beta, Gamma and Omicron) linked to escape from antibody-mediated immunity. We further demonstrate how vaccine potency and induction of cross-reacting nAb can be markedly enhanced by alternative spike antigen choice and design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Little experimental support exists on how well current first-generation vaccines protect against the full spectrum of VOCs. While likely protecting from severe COVID-19 caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, a clear drop in VE was observed during clinical trials conducted in regions with high circulation of VOC Beta as paradigm of an E484K Spike variant and others known to escape nAb recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Experimentally, such a drop in protective immunity is confirmed by higher viral loads in macaques vaccinated with an Adenovirus-vectored prototype spike antigen (Ad26.COV2.S) and challenged with VOC Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Likewise, in the more stringent hamster model, immunity acquired during previous SARS-CoV-2 (prototype) infection, or by Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, led only to partial suppression of heterologous VOC Beta replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In the latter case, replicative viral RNA was still detectable two weeks after challenge (&lt; 2 log<sub>10</sub> reduction compared to sham), which is completely in line with the observed failure of prototypic YF-S0 to confer full protection against VOC Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-H</xref>). By contrast, viral replication was reduced to undetectable levels for all four VOCs by YF-S0* vaccination using an updated spike antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Finally, S0* blocked transmission of VOC Delta, for which a single dose vaccination was sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The stringent hamster model is generally well suited to assess both aspects of preclinical VE, individual protection and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). An obvious shortcoming of our current study is the limited infectivity of VOC Omicron in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and that VE of YF-S0*against Omicron can hence not directly be assessed in this gold standard model. However, considering (<italic>i</italic>) that VOC Omicron is poorly, if at all, covered by current vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and (<italic>ii</italic>) nAbs are strongly correlated with VE, the gain in Omicron-specific nAb achieved by YF-S0* vaccination is remarkable. Successful testing in complementary animal models (e.g. human ACE2- transgenic hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) will warrant further development of YF-S0* as a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate with broader coverage of relevant virus strains.</p><p id="P18">In more general terms, our findings strongly suggest that first-generation COVID-19 vaccines will need to be adapted to keep up with the evolution of variants driving the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as a result of their critical combinations of driver mutations responsible for both nAb escape and enhanced transmission.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Viruses and animals</title><p id="P19">All virus-related work was conducted in the high-containment BSL3 facilities of the KU Leuven Rega Institute (3CAPS) under licenses AMV 30112018 SBB 219 2018 0892 and AMV 23102017 SBB 219 2017 0589 according to institutional guidelines.

induced by current first-generation vaccines. There is hence an urgent need for universal vaccines that cover variants of concern (VOC). In this paper we show that an adapted version of our vaccine candidate YF-S0* provides full protection from infection, virus transmission and disease by VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and also results in markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against recently emerged Omicron VOC in a stringent hamster model. Our findings underline the necessity to update COVID-19 vaccines to curb the pandemic, providing experimental proof on how to maintain vaccine efficacy in view of an evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of first-generation Spike vaccine against prototype SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs Alpha and Beta</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Vaccination scheme with prototypic YF17D-based vaccine candidate YF-S0 (S0).
