In this work, we evaluated the immunomodulation effect caused by <italic>Candida intermedia</italic> in mice vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2. We conducted preliminary tests using murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) stimulated with viable and heat-killed yeast cells, culture supernatant, and DNA, using qPCR to detect the mRNA transcription. Next, mice were supplemented with <italic>C. intermedia</italic> before each dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and then antibody production was measured by ELISA. The probiotic strain <italic>S. boulardii</italic> CNCM I-745 was used as a control. We also explored the differences in fecal microbiomes between the non-supplemented and supplemented groups. Live cells of <italic>C. intermedia</italic> increased the transcription of <italic>IL-4</italic>, <italic>IL-13</italic>, and <italic>STAT3</italic> by macrophages RAW 264.7, while heat-killed cells up-regulated <italic>TNFα</italic> and <italic>Bcl6</italic>, and the culture supernatant positively impacted <italic>TLR2</italic> transcription. Concanavalin, zymosan, and lipopolysaccharide were used to stimulate splenocytes from <italic>C. intermedia</italic>-supplemented animals, which showed increased transcription of <italic>TNFα</italic>, <italic>IFNγ</italic>, <italic>IL-4</italic>, <italic>Bcl6</italic>, and <italic>STAT3</italic>. Sera from these animals showed enhanced levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, as well as IgG1 and IgM isotypes, and sIgA in fecal samples. The microbiome of the <italic>C. intermedia</italic>-supplemented group showed a higher abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. and <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp., impacting the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes balance. We concluded that <italic>C. intermedia</italic> and <italic>S. boulardii</italic> could stimulate and impact the gene expression of cells important for innate immunity, influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and primarily boost the humoral response after vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>probiotics</kwd><kwd>non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic></kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The definition of probiotics, which refers to live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], has been established for years. This definition was mainly based on the observation of the beneficial effect on the host that certain microorganisms cause in the prevention and treatment of pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. However, knowledge of the influence on the general physiology of the organism, such as the modulation of immunological homeostasis, activation of mucosal immunity mechanisms, and modulation of adaptative immune functions, confers the aggregation of “immunobiotics” to the definition of these microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Bacteria of different genera, such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp., comprise most of the probiotics characterized so far, however, the possibility of horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance genes between probiotic and pathogenic bacteria makes their application limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Yeasts are naturally antibiotic-resistant, but they are not capable of transmitting this resistance to other yeasts or bacteria because the genes involved in this role are present in their chromosomes, and not in bacterial plasmids, as occurs in tetracycline resistance genes, which can be shared between bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> has been commercialized and studied since the 1950s and is currently the best-characterized yeast in terms of its probiotic activity, safety, and application in the treatment of chronic gastrointestinal diseases and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Different strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are also studied for their probiotic mechanisms of adhesion to intestinal cells, antagonism to bacteria, and immunomodulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], however, other non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts emerge as possible new probiotics with a beneficial effect equal to or greater than those observed for <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Antagonism to pathogenic microorganisms, production of killer toxins, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) tolerance, and other characteristics that characterize probiotic microorganisms are also observed in yeasts of genera such as <italic>Candida, Hanseniaspora, Pichia, Kluyveromyces, Issatchenkia</italic>, <italic>Torulaspora</italic>, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Microorganisms with probiotic functions can also impact the GIT microbiota. Researchers suggest that this impact is related to the effect on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota, mainly by maintaining the stability of the microbial community, modulating metabolic functions, or favoring the presence of determined bacteria, fungi, and archaea taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Besides that, these probiotics positively impact intestinal surface integrity, producing antimicrobial compounds and metabolites that hinder pathogens’ growth and compete for binding sites in the intestinal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The administration of probiotic yeasts has already been linked to positive changes in the microbiota of fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], among others. Since these changes in the microbiota composition can benefit and improve the immune response of hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], this is another aspect that should be studied in the use of probiotics.</p><p id="P5">Recent studies developed by our research group with wild yeasts isolated from the environment in the region of Pelotas (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], demonstrated the potential of probiotic activity of the yeasts <italic>Hanseniaspora uvarum</italic> (PIT001), <italic>Pichia kluyveri</italic> (LAR001) and <italic>Candida intermedia</italic> (ORQ001), as well as the ability to participate in fermentation processes of beverages. These non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts were able to tolerate conditions similar to the GIT <italic>in vitro</italic>, in addition to showing antimicrobial activity to foodborne pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> among others. Strains of these three yeasts are generally associated with their presence in the microbiome, fermentative profile, and sensory contribution in fermented products such as wine, beer, and cocoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and they currently arouse interest regarding their antagonism activity to other competitive or contaminant microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Some strains of <italic>C. intermedia</italic> have demonstrated the ability to decrease or suppress the growth of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], in addition to being responsible for the production of antimicrobial peptides that affect other yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. This yeast had its genome recently sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], but its presence in fermented dairy foods was already described 30 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], we identified <italic>in vitro</italic> some potential probiotic characteristics in the isolate <italic>C. intermedia</italic> ORQ001, such as high levels of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with pathogenic Gram– and Gram+ bacteria, and a low decrease in cell viability after exposure to GIT conditions. Based on these results, we focused on the development of new studies regarding the probiotic potential of this yeast.</p><p id="P7">Although there are several studies evaluating the probiotic activity of specific strains, information regarding their administration and behavior <italic>in vivo</italic> is scarce, as well as knowledge of pathways and roles of action in GIT performance. The mechanisms of action of the immunomodulatory effect are still not completely elucidated, mainly for non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts, however, there is enough evidence that suggests the need for a deep investigation into it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. As highlighted for yeasts like <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and by our group for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. boulardii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], the evaluation of immune system modulation and ability to control pathogens <italic>in vivo</italic> represent important and expressive results in the search for probiotic characteristics in these microorganisms. When these yeasts are administered as supplements, it is possible to observe the improvement of specific immune responses to vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], immunostimulatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], reduction of pathogen concentration in experimentally infected animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], or even the prevention of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Recently, researchers have linked the immunostimulatory effect of probiotics to the potentiation of the immune response to different vaccines and antigens, suggesting a great relevance in the treatment and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Previous studies developed by our research group using an experimental vaccine composed of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] demonstrated that the vaccine stimulated humoral and cellular immune responses, which it is believed can be potentiated by the administration of probiotics.

Santos <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>] observed in PBMCs from animals supplemented with <italic>S. boulardii</italic> CNCM I-745 an increased mRNA transcription of <italic>IL-2, IFNγ, and Bcl6</italic> when stimulated by ConcA or <italic>Clostridium chauvoei</italic>. In our study, macrophages from animals supplemented with <italic>S. boulardii</italic> also showed an increase in <italic>IFNγ</italic> (after Zymosan and LPS stimuli) and <italic>Bcl6</italic> (ConcA and LPS) levels. Chou <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>] also demonstrated an up-regulation of IFNγ expression in spleen cells from animals supplemented with an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> fermentation product, showing that live cells plus their active secreted metabolites are important for the immunomodulatory effects of the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeast.</p><p id="P49">Zymosan, ConcA, and LPS are well-known immune response stimulants with different origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>], so comparing splenocyte responses after stimulation with these molecules permits the prediction of and helps identify the influence of yeast administration on animals’ immune systems in different scenarios. Based on our findings, <italic>C. intermedia</italic> was suggested as a microorganism with potent immunomodulation effects in cytokine transcription by splenocytes, even superior to <italic>S. boulardii</italic>, which was observed in <italic>TNFα, IFNγ, IL-4,</italic> and <italic>IL-12</italic> mRNA transcription. IFNγ is one of the most potent macrophage activators, and together with TNFα and IL-12, it is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. Besides inducing an up-regulation in cytokine transcription, it was also observed an increase in the mRNA levels of transcription factors, of which STAT3 transcription was consistently up-regulated no matter what the stimulus. Since our work was the first to explore the immunomodulatory activity of <italic>C. intermedia</italic> and its application <italic>in vivo</italic>, more data is necessary to better understand all the immunological signals and pathways involved after its administration to animals.</p><p id="P50">When dealing with the <italic>Candida</italic> genus, it is always important to highlight that safety is crucial to determining the possibility of yeast usage as a tool to promote health, since even non-<italic>albicans</italic> species may cause infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. Most of the infections (63-70%) related to <italic>Candida</italic> spp. are caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and the rest are associated with other 18-30 species classified in <italic>Candida</italic> genus (non-<italic>albicans</italic>) that comprises around 200 species, such as <italic>C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. auris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. At this date, <italic>C. intermedia</italic> is not a common human pathogen; it is described in the literature only in 3 cases associated with infections involving immunosuppressed individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. Nevertheless, a presumption of safety for use of <italic>C. intermedia</italic> in fermented food products was published in the Bulletin of the International Dairy Federation 495/2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>], and, in our study, there were no related deaths or apparent signals of yeast infection in the supplemented animals. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the safety of supplementation with <italic>C. intermedia</italic>.</p><p id="P51">Modulation of vaccine response by <italic>C. intermedia</italic> and <italic>S. boulardii</italic> ingestion was evaluated in our study associated with an experimental vaccine composed of inactivated SARS-CoV-2. The potential of <italic>S. boulardii</italic> to improve immune responses after vaccination was identified by our group in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>], and is also related in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. Our results demonstrated for the first time the possibility of supplementation with yeasts to improve the immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as well as showed non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts as potential (and promising) candidates for this application. While studies linking bacteria and their probiotic activity are more common, an unknown number of non-conventional yeasts (besides <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> spp.) are waiting to be discovered in this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. <italic>C. intermedia</italic> supplementation suggested a positive impact on the humoral response of mice vaccinated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, an aspect that confirmed the immunomodulatory role of this yeast. Although our results do not reflect confirmation of higher protection against virus infection or organism protection, they provoke interest in new studies using other vaccines (viral, bacterial, recombinant, etc.), animal models (ovine, bovine, humans, etc.), pathogen challenge, and protocols of supplementation (short-term × long-term) associated with the yeast administration.</p><p id="P52">Some authors described enhanced levels of IgG and sIgA when probiotics were administered in association with immunizations using DNA vectors, recombinant subunits, and viral vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>], which was also observed in our results for <italic>C. intermedia</italic>-supplemented animals. These findings are relevant because secretory IgA is predominant in mucosal surfaces, playing an important role in viral immunity, and it is suggested its role in an enhanced capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. Klingler <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>] also described the importance of IgA antibodies; moreover, it was found that IgG1 and IgM have a strong contribution to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. After immunization with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Ruggiero <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>] identified different IgG/IgM response patterns in vaccinated individuals, in which a coordinated response based on these two immunoglobulin classes was determined to be important to confer protection against viral infection. Here we observed that supplementation with <italic>C. intermedia</italic> increased the production of both IgG and IgM levels, a possible immune response modulation that may be a determinant to prevent or hinder viral infection.</p><p id="P53">Besides the influence on humoral and cellular responses, we investigated changes in the GIT microbiome caused by <italic>C. intermedia</italic> and <italic>S. boulardii</italic> supplementation. The intestinal microbiome, composed of several microorganisms, plays an essential role in host immunity and makes great contributions to the host’s health, including improving nutrient digestion and absorption, differentiation of the intestinal epithelium, maintenance of intestinal mucosal barrier, prevention of pathogen attachment, and impacts on the polarization of the intestinal-specific immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Supplementation of animals’ diets with <italic>S. boulardii</italic> is being studied mainly for farm animals as an alternative to antibiotics, in which its activity of shaping the gut microbiome is highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This change in microbiome composition caused by <italic>S. boulardii</italic> also impacts the decrease of obesity, fat mass, hepatic disorders, and metabolic inflammation, as demonstrated by Everard <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. While Everard <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>] and Yu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>] described in their results a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes abundance in mice supplemented with this yeast, we observed a similar Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio between the non-supplemented and <italic>S. boulardii</italic>-supplemented groups.</p><p id="P54">On the other hand, differences in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were observed in the microbiome of <italic>C. intermedia</italic> animals, with increased levels of Bacteroidetes and lowered levels of Firmicutes. The increase in Bacteroidetes abundance, especially for the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genus, may be related to the utilization of mannan available on <italic>Candida</italic> cell walls through degrading enzymes (mannanases and mannosidases) expressed by <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp., serving as a nutrient (carbon) source for the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>]. LPS derived from <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. are described as showing impaired or even inhibitory capacity to elicit an inflammatory response, and a decrease in its abundance in the gut microbiome often results in an augmented population of pro-inflammatory bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>]. The enriched presence of certain Bacteroidetes (<italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp.) with anti-inflammatory properties was linked to fewer adverse effects after vaccination and associated with the highest antibody titers in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>], correlating with our results. However, this positive association is not a consensus in the literature.</p><p id="P55">Bacterial species can take advantage of the biofilm created by <italic>Candida</italic> and adhere to it to thrive under conditions that would be harsh for them in GIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>]. It was demonstrated for <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>C. difficile</italic> that these bacteria benefit from the microenvironment and microbial interactions when co-cultured with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>], and in our study, this positive interaction between <italic>Candida-Clostridium</italic> may be the answer to enhanced levels of <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. in the microbiome of <italic>C. intermedia</italic>-supplemented animals. The abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. was lower in the microbiome of yeast-supplemented animals, which may be due to the competition between yeasts and bacteria for the same metabolic niches throughout the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]; however, further studies are needed to prove this linkage. Finally, several mechanisms affect the response to vaccines, including vaccine formulation, dose, immunization route, vaccination schedule, the host immune system, and the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. The modulation of resident microbiota by probiotics is a factor that may improve vaccine immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>], thus we suggest that the alterations detected in the microbiomes of the supplemented mice could be one of the key factors associated with the increase in the humoral response detected in these groups.</p><p id="P56">In summary, we demonstrated in this study that supplementation with the yeasts <italic>C. intermedia</italic> ORQ001 and <italic>S. boulardii</italic> CNCM I-745 could stimulate immune cells important in innate immunity, were able to regulate the expression of different genes related to immune response, influenced the GIT microbiome, and primarily boosted a specific humoral response after vaccination. Even though <italic>S. boulardii</italic> is a well-known yeast with probiotic activity, every new study is important to understand its immunomodulation effect. For the first time, <italic>C. intermedia</italic> was proposed as a microorganism that modulates the immune system, and it demonstrated a positive impact on the immune response of animals vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Our findings obtained through <italic>in vivo</italic> tests complement previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that already proposed its probiotic activity, provoking interest in further studies to investigate its safety. We also concluded that the administration of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and non-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts may have importance in vaccination schedules, representing an alternative for boosting immune responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. Dr. Fernando Spilki and his team for providing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 samples.
