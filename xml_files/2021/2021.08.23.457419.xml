<abstract>
<p id="P1">Antivirals that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 are needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and is an attractive target for antiviral development. Here we report the use of the Random nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) mRNA display on a chemically cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> dimer, which yielded several high-affinity thioether-linked cyclic peptide inhibitors of the protease. Structural analysis of M<sup>pro</sup> complexed with a selenoether analogue of the highest-affinity peptide revealed key binding interactions, including glutamine and leucine residues in sites S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, respectively, and a binding epitope straddling both protein chains in the physiological dimer. Several of these M<sup>pro</sup> peptide inhibitors possessed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> with EC<sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range. These cyclic peptides serve as a foundation for the development of much needed antivirals that specifically target SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused widespread morbidity and mortality as well as devastation to the global economy since the disease was first reported in late 2019 in Wuhan, China<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. At the time of writing there has been more than 200 million confirmed cases and 4.3 million deaths worldwide as a result of COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. There has been significant effort from the global research community to develop effective vaccines for COVID-19; this has been enormously successful, with adenoviral vectored vaccines, protein vaccines and mRNA vaccines now in widespread use across the world. Whilst vaccines will enable protective immunity in most, there will be populations where vaccine-based immunity may fail, and these individuals will be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future. It is furthermore unclear what changes will appear in the virus in contemporary SARS-CoV-2 viral variants (highlighted by the recent emergence of the delta variant B.1.617.2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, and how those variants will navigate both convalescent and vaccine immune responses. Given that this is the third coronavirus that has crossed via zoonoses, antiviral development against SARS-CoV-2, and future coronaviruses with pandemic potential, are desperately needed in addition to prophylactic vaccines.</p>
<p id="P3">While there have been significant efforts toward the discovery of effective antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority of molecules that have completed (or are currently being assessed in) clinical trials were originally developed for other infectious and inflammatory disease indications and are being repurposed for COVID-19. For example, remdesivir, originally trialled for Ebola, is currently the only antiviral drug to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19. While the molecule has been shown to possess some activity during early infection, it has shown limited to no efficacy in a number of trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>, as well as in infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Other repurposed antiviral drugs that have entered trials include the HIV combination therapy lopinavir-ritonavir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>, type I interferon treatments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, and the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>; however, these have not demonstrated improvement in disease progression over standard care. In fact, it has recently been suggested that many repurposing efforts may be compromised by experimental artefacts reflecting the physicochemical properties of certain drugs rather than specific target-based activities<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. To date, the most effective therapeutic intervention for improving COVID-19 patient outcomes in a hospital setting is the use of the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which reduces inflammation-mediated lung injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with elevated levels of C-reactive protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Based on the above, there is an urgent need for the discovery of effective antivirals for COVID-19, ideally with mechanisms of action that specifically target proteins critical in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle.</p>
<p id="P4">Infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral spike protein (S) with the host cell-surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Following receptor binding of the virus, the spike protein is activated by cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains leading to host cell entry via two distinct pathways: 1) an endocytic pathway through endosomal–lysosomal compartments with spike cleavage facilitated by lysosomal cathepsins, or 2) a cell surface pathway following activation by a serine protease such as TMPRSS2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Following proteolysis, the N-terminus of the cleaved S2 domain is embedded into the cell membrane and leads to fusion of the membranes of the virus and the host cell, followed by transfer of viral RNA into the cytoplasm <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Viral gene expression within the host cell results in the translation of two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Embedded within these polyproteins are sixteen non-structural proteins critical for viral replication, the majority of which form the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) and helicase (nsp13)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. These proteins become functional only after proteolytic release by two viral proteases. The first of these is a domain of nsp3 called the papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) which cleaves the pp1a and pp1ab at three sites, releasing nsp1, nsp2 and nsp3<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. The second is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), also called nsp5 or the chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), which cleaves pp1a and pp1ab at a minimum of 11 distinct cleavage sites to release nsp4-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, M<sup>pro</sup> has also been found to aid in immune evasion by inhibiting type I IFN production, contributing to the impaired type I IFN response that has become a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with persistent viral load and poor patient outcomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. M<sup>pro</sup> forms a catalytically active homodimer which cleaves with high specificity at Leu-Gln↓Xaa (where ↓ represents the cleavage site and Xaa can be Ser, Ala or Asn)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Such sequence specificity has not been observed for any human proteases and therefore peptide or peptidomimetic based inhibitors are predicted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with high selectivity and with minimal off-target effects in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">The key role of M<sup>pro</sup> for the replication and viability of SARS-CoV-2 has naturally led to the search for novel inhibitors of the protease. Perhaps the most promising of these are the peptidomimetic compounds developed by Pfizer, inspired by PF-00835231 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4-8 nM against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>) that was originally developed against SARS-CoV-1 M<sup>pro</sup>, which possesses high homology to the SARS-CoV-2 protease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Specifically, a phosphate prodrug of this inhibitor (PF07304814) has recently completed a phase 1b trial (clinical trials identifier NCT04535167). A second-generation orally available peptidomimetic M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor developed by Pfizer (PF-07321332, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) has also recently entered phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 (clinical trials identifier NCT04960202)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Both molecules possess a γ-lactam mimic of the glutamine (Gln) residue found at the P1 position in physiological cleavage sites and also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> via a covalent mechanism through electrophilic warheads embedded within the inhibitors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Specifically, PF-00835231 possesses a hydroxymethyl ketone moiety, while PF-07321332 contains a nitrile warhead, both of which react with the catalytic cysteine (Cys145) to inactivate the protease. In addition to these clinical candidates, a number of other peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> are currently under preclinical investigation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>, including repurposed drugs such as boceprevir, a serine protease inhibitor approved in 2011 for the treatment of hepatitis C<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>, and the feline anticoronaviral drug GC376 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Macrocyclic peptides are attractive chemotypes for medicinal chemistry efforts due to their ability to bind targets with high affinity and selectivity, whilst exhibiting greater proteolytic stability and membrane permeability than their linear counterparts <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. In this work we describe several potent cyclic peptide inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, identified through the use of the <underline>Ra</underline>ndom nonstandard <underline>P</underline>eptide <underline>I</underline>ntegrated <underline>D</underline>iscovery (RaPID) technology, which couples mRNA display with flexizyme-mediated genetic code reprogramming<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, we also report a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> dimer bound to our most potent cyclic peptide inhibitor that highlights the residues important for binding both at the catalytic site and across the dimer interface. Finally, we demonstrate that three of the cyclic peptides identified exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, with an additional peptide gaining antiviral activity upon conjugation to a cell penetrating peptide.</p>

<title>Selection against chemically cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer</title>
<p id="P8">In order to identify cyclic peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, we sought to utilize RaPID, which allows the screening of &gt;10<sup>12</sup> cyclic peptides for affinity against a protein target of interest immobilized on magnetic beads. However, functional SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> is a homodimer with relatively weak affinity between the monomers (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.5 μM), and we hypothesized that the protein may exist in a predominantly monomeric (i.e. inactive) form when immobilized on magnetic beads<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with this, we found that the catalytic activity (measured by fluorescent substrate cleavage) of C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged M<sup>pro</sup> was significantly diminished (ca. 30%) when immobilized on His Pull-down Dynabeads™ compared to that of the wild-type protein in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>); this indicated that a significant proportion of the immobilized M<sup>pro</sup> was unable to form an active homodimer. We therefore investigated the use of a chemical cross-linking strategy to covalently lock SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in the homodimeric state to ensure that RaPID resulted in selection of ligands to the catalytically active form of the protease. The presence of proximal lysine residues near the dimer interface in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (PDB: 6Y2E) prompted us to investigate a number of amine-reactive bifunctional cross-linkers of differing lengths for this purpose<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Efficient cross-linking was obtained by disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a and 2b</xref>), with subsequent mapping by LC-MS/MS revealing intermolecular cross-links between lysine residues on the different monomer chains (K97-K97*, K97-K90*). We also observed cross-links between K12 and K97, which are positioned in close proximity on different monomers of the dimer, as well as within the same monomer unit; however, in this case we could not differentiate between intermolecular or intramolecular cross-links by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Importantly, cross-linked M<sup>pro</sup> exhibited catalytic activity comparable to that of wild-type M<sup>pro</sup> (in solution), following immobilization on magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Based on these data, we moved on to RaPID selections against the cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with a view to discovering novel cyclic peptide inhibitors.</p>
<p id="P9">To select for peptide binders of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> we performed parallel display using the RaPID mRNA display technology, employing peptide libraries initiated with either <italic>N</italic>-chloroacetyl-L-tyrosine or <italic>N</italic>-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine to induce thioether macrocyclization through reaction with the side chain of a downstream cysteine residue. Tyr was chosen as the initiating amino acid due to its high translation efficiency in place of <italic>N</italic>-formyl-Met<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>, while the use of D-Tyr in addition to L-Tyr expanded the accessible chemical space of the library. For each selection, a semi-randomized DNA library of &gt;10<sup>13</sup> unique sequences were transcribed into mRNA followed by ligation to a puromycin linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Translation of the mRNA-puromycin hybrids <italic>in vitro,</italic> followed by reverse transcription, yielded a library of peptide-mRNA:cDNA conjugates that were counter-selected against His Pull-down Dynabeads™ (to remove bead-binding peptides) before an affinity selection step, in which the libraries were panned against bead-immobilized cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. PCR of the bead-bound fraction yielded an enriched DNA library that was used as the starting point for the subsequent rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Following nine iterative rounds of this process, next-generation sequencing of the final DNA library identified several peptide sequences predicted to bind to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> based on high relative abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Synthesis and <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of cyclic peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>
</title>
<p id="P10">We selected eight peptides from the enriched libraries for synthesis (five L-Tyr initiated and three D-Tyr initiated) based on their abundance in the final DNA library and diversity in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a and 3b</xref>). Peptides <bold>1</bold>–<bold>8</bold> were synthesized <italic>via</italic> Fmoc-strategy solid-phase peptide synthesis on Rink amide resin with the N-terminal L- or D-Tyr residue derivatized with chloroacetic acid to facilitate thioether cyclization with the thiol of a downstream cysteine residue. Deprotection and cleavage from resin followed by cyclization provided the target thioether-linked cyclic peptides <bold>1</bold>–<bold>8</bold> following purification by reverse-phase HPLC. The synthetic cyclic peptides were next evaluated for inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> using a previously reported fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Gratifyingly, we observed potent inhibition of proteolytic activity for six of the eight peptides in the series, with IC<sub>
<bold>50</bold>
</sub> values for peptides <bold>1</bold>–<bold>6</bold> ranging from 0.070 – 12.7 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, despite being enriched in the selection, lariat peptide <bold>7</bold> and head to tail cyclic peptide <bold>8</bold> did not show appreciable inhibition of the protease (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM). The most potent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor in the series was cyclic peptide <bold>1</bold>, which exhibited an IC50 of 70 ± 18 nM and a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> of 14 ± 3 nM against the protease. Given the superior inhibitory potency of this molecule over the other cyclic peptides that emerged from the RaPID screen (&gt;15-fold), this molecule was selected for further structure-activity investigations.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Probing the binding interaction of lead cyclic peptide 1</title>
<p id="P11">We next performed experiments to probe the key interactions of lead cyclic peptide inhibitor <bold>1</bold> with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Given the critical role dimerization plays in M<sup>pro</sup> catalytic activity, we first investigated the effect of <bold>1</bold> on the monomer-dimer equilibrium of M<sup>pro</sup> by multi-angle laser light scattering with size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALLS). Interestingly, the addition of two molar equivalents of peptide <bold>1</bold> to a solution of wild-type M<sup>pro</sup> (present in an approximately 1:1 ratio of monomer:dimer) resulted in a shift in the dimer-monomer equilibrium to afford a solution of exclusively homodimeric protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). This data indicates that cyclic peptide <bold>1</bold> stabilizes the homodimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and suggests that peptide <bold>1</bold> may bind to the active site present in the dimeric, but not monomeric forms of the protein. To corroborate this data, we used 3D NMR spectroscopy (specifically TROSY-HNCO spectra) to analyze SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> after titration with peptide <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). This revealed shifts of backbone NMR resonances of residues near the active site, consistent with binding of peptide <bold>1</bold> at this location. However, shifts were also observed for residues located far from the active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the protein responds to the binding of <bold>1</bold> with global allosteric changes. In contrast, titration of the obligate monomeric mutant R298A of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> <sup>

</sup> with peptide <bold>1</bold> led to no shifts in NMR resonances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for full assignment of monomeric M<sup>pro</sup> mutant). Notably, R298, which is mutated in the obligate monomer, is buried within the dimer interface in the structure of the wild-type protease and therefore the lack of binding of <bold>1</bold> to the monomeric protein is unlikely to be owing to a loss of interactions with this amino acid residue. Taken together, these SEC-MALLS and NMR data therefore suggest that peptide <bold>1</bold> selectively binds to and inhibits the active homodimer of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> but does not bind to the inactive monomer.</p>
<p id="P12">Cyclic peptide <bold>1</bold> includes the cleavage recognition motif of M<sup>pro</sup> found in the natural viral protein substrates, namely a Gln in the P<sub>1</sub> position and a Leu in the P<sub>2</sub> position<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. It was therefore hypothesized that this Leu-Gln motif embedded within <bold>1</bold> mimics the natural substrate and binds to the catalytic site of the protease. Importantly, this proposal is supported by the purely competitive inhibition mode observed for <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). However, this also raises the possibility that the protease may be able to cleave <bold>1</bold> next to the Gln-Leu recognition sequence. To test this, we incubated <bold>1</bold> with wild type SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and assessed cleavage by MALDI-TOF-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Peptide <bold>1</bold> exhibited notable resistance to proteolysis by M<sup>pro</sup> with negligible cleavage of peptide <bold>1</bold> observed under standard assay conditions (25 nM M<sup>pro</sup>) after 1 h. However, incubation of <bold>1</bold> with a high concentration of M<sup>pro</sup> (2.5 μM) resulted in slow cleavage of peptide <bold>1</bold>, with 30% peptide cleavage observed after 1 h. Analysis of the cleavage reaction by LC-MS/MS confirmed that proteolysis had indeed occurred between Gln3 and Tyr4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6b</xref>). We also synthesized an authentic standard of the resulting cleavage product, which was verified to be identical to M<sup>pro</sup>-cleaved <bold>1</bold> by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Finally, we assessed whether the linear peptide product resulting from M<sup>pro</sup> cleavage of <bold>1</bold> possessed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Interestingly, the peptide exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 23.2 ± 5 μM, ~330-fold higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> of 70 nM for <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). This two-orders of magnitude loss in activity upon linearization suggests that the conformation of cyclic peptide <bold>1</bold> is pre-organised for optimal interaction with the protease.</p>
<p id="P13">In order to assess the importance of each residue in <bold>1</bold> for M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity, we systematically replaced all residues in the peptide with alanine (except alkyl side chain-containing amino acids Ala5, Val6 and Leu7) and determined the inhibitory activity of the resulting mutants against M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Consistent with the known recognition sequence for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and supported by the mass spectrometry results described above, mutation of either Leu2 or Gln3 to Ala (that would be predicted to bind in the S2 and S1 recognition sites, respectively) led to more than two orders of magnitude reduction in inhibitory activity. Remarkably, mutation of Tyr4 (which would be predicted at P<sub>1</sub>') also led to a significant loss in inhibitor activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.9 μM); while this is consistent with the established importance of aromaticity in P1', small residues such as alanine are often found in substrates at this position, and the dramatic reduction in inhibitory potency was therefore unexpected <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, mutation of Arg11, which is distal from the most prominent recognition residues of the cyclic peptide, also led to a significant reduction in inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.4 μM) suggesting that this residue makes important interactions with the protease and/or serves a crucial role in the adoption of the active conformation of the cyclic peptide. In contrast, mutation of Arg8, His9, Lys10, Arg12 or Glu13 resulted in equipotent activity or only a modest reduction in inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> values = 90–390 nM).</p>

<title>Co-crystallization of peptide 1 and a selenoether analogue with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>

<p id="P14">In order to further interrogate the binding mode of inhibitor <bold>1</bold>, we used X-ray diffraction to solve the co-crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>-<bold>1</bold> complex to 3.4 Å. The limited resolution of the structure hindered the interpretation of the electron density within the active site. We therefore also solved the structure of a synthetic selenoether analogue of <bold>1</bold> (<bold>Se-1</bold>) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, in which the cysteine residue involved in thioether peptide macrocyclization was replaced with selenocysteine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>; we rationalized that the greater electron density of Se in this analogue would aid its placement in the active site. Importantly, <bold>Se-1</bold> displayed identical inhibitory activity as <bold>1</bold> (<italic>K</italic>

A crystal of this SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>-<bold>Se-1</bold> complex diffracted to 2.19 Å resolution in the same space group and with similar cell dimensions as the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>-<bold>1</bold> complex, thus providing a detailed view of the interactions between the inhibitor and the protease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The crystal dimensions and packing are unique and not observed in any of the hundreds of deposited SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> structures, with a notably long <italic>b</italic> axis. There were four protein subunits within the asymmetric unit comprising two physiological dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Although the peptide is not fully resolved in the structure, 9-13 residues were observable in various chains with good electron density; the selenoether linkage and the first 5 residues (D-Tyr1, Leu2, Gln3, Tyr4, Ala5) were very stable, with the remainder of the peptide (7-12) appearing somewhat disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). The peptide displayed a consensus binding pose across three subunits of the crystal structure. The fourth subunit displayed an alternative binding pose in which Leu2 and Gln3 were present in identical positions, but the flanking D-Tyr1 and Tyr4 residues adopted alternative conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a and 9b</xref>). Closer inspection revealed a non-Pro <italic>cis-</italic>peptide bond between Tyr4 and Ala3 in chains A, C, D, which results in a tight kink in the helix, while in chain B this bond remains in the <italic>trans</italic>-configuration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c and 9d</xref>). The Gln3 of the peptide occupies the canonical S<sub>1</sub> subsite of the protease (following the numbering by Lee <italic>et al.</italic>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup> in every peptide:protein complex, facilitated by interactions with His163, Glu166, and Asn142 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Likewise, Leu2 is always bound in the S<sub>2</sub> subsite comprised of His41, His164 and Gln189. D-Tyr1 is in the solvent-exposed S<sub>3</sub> site bordered by Gln189, Ala191 and Pro16, while the peptide twists at the selenoether/D-Tyr1 linkage, turning away from the canonical S<sub>4</sub> site to be positioned adjacent to Glu166. Tyr4 is therefore positioned in the S<sub>1</sub>' (P<sub>1</sub>') position in ¾ chains, fully consistent with the slow proteolysis between Gln3 and Tyr4 observed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). In chain B, the peptide backbone and Tyr4 have swapped positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a and 9b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">To obtain a better understanding of the interaction of the full peptide with the protein in the absence of crystal contacts, we modelled the missing residues as accurately as possible with the available density and used this structure as the starting point for triplicate 333 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup> (~1 μs total simulation time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). The results were consistent with the crystal structure, i.e. residues 1-4 were all relatively stable within their respective binding pockets within the substrate cleft of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, with the mobility of the peptide increasing on either side of these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). Notably, the simulations showed regular transient interactions between the peptide and the second chain of the physiological dimer.</p>
<p id="P17">The structure and MD simulations also provide a molecular explanation for the inhibitory activity of the alanine mutants. Specifically, the structure shows that the central interactions are formed by Leu2 and Gln3, consistent with the large reductions in activity when these positions are mutated to Ala, while D-Tyr1 and Tyr4 also form significant interactions with the protease on either side of these residues. Other positions (8, 9, 10, 12 and 13) that were observed to have little influence on inhibitory activity are either disordered or solvent-exposed. MD simulations suggest that Arg11, the mutation of which to Ala had a significant effect on inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), makes contacts across the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9e</xref>), interacting with the side chain and main chain carbonyl of Q256*. This is consistent with electron density showing Arg11 within hydrogen bonding distance of the neighbouring chain B in one dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>). These observations are consistent with the SEC-MALLS and NMR data that shows the peptide binds the dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> exclusively for its mode of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a and 4b</xref>).</p>

<title>Antiviral activity of cyclic peptide SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors</title>
<p id="P18">Given the promising inhibitory activity of cyclic peptides <bold>1</bold>–<bold>6</bold> against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, we next assessed the antiviral activity of the four most potent peptides against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, we used ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 overexpressing HEK293T cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 to assess each peptide. The latter cell line is hyper-permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection with extensive viral syncytia forming after 18 hours post viral infection. Dose-dependent sigmoidal inhibition curves can be generated through enumeration of remaining single cell nuclei using a live nuclear dye and a standard high content fluorescent microscope. In this setting, we observed a dose-dependent protection for three of the four peptides, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11.8 – 33.1 μM. However, peptide <bold>1</bold>, the most active compound in the enzyme inhibition assay, was inactive up to a concentration of 50 μM, most likely due to low cell permeability owing to the large number of polar and charged residues in this molecule. To facilitate cell entry of <bold>1</bold>, we therefore conjugated its C-terminus to penetratin, a 16 amino acid cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Antennapedia homeodomain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup> (to afford <bold>pen-1</bold>). It should be noted that during the selection process the C-terminus of the peptides is conjugated to a large mRNA:cDNA tag, and therefore addition of a CPP to the C-terminus of the peptide (to afford <bold>pen-1</bold>) was deemed unlikely to affect binding and inhibition of M<sup>pro</sup>. Pleasingly, <bold>pen-1</bold> had equivalent <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> to peptide <bold>1</bold> (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> = 9 nM for <bold>pen-1</bold> vs 14 nM for <bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) indicating that addition of a CPP to the C-terminus of the peptide did not affect binding and inhibition of the protease. We also prepared a penetratin conjugate of cyclic peptide <bold>6</bold>, the second most active peptide in the enzyme inhibition assay (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> = 360 nM). While parent cyclic peptide <bold>6</bold> showed antiviral activity in the cell-based assay (EC<sub>50</sub> of 33.1 μM), we anticipated that the conjugation to penetratin might further improve potency. We also assessed the cytotoxicity of <bold>1</bold>, <bold>pen-1</bold>, <bold>6</bold> and <bold>pen-6</bold> on HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, with none of the compounds affecting cell viability at a concentration of 50 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Pleasingly, we found that <bold>pen-1</bold> and <bold>pen-6</bold> both exhibited significantly improved antiviral activity, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 15.2 μM and 6.6 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). As expected, the marked improvement in antiviral activity of peptide <bold>1</bold> by conjugation to the penetratin CPP correlated with enhanced cellular uptake, whereby LC-MS/MS analysis showed a 5.5-fold increase in levels of <bold>pen-1</bold> compared to <bold>1</bold> in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">In summary, we discovered macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> using RaPID mRNA display technology. A protein cross-linking strategy was employed to generate a covalently locked catalytically active dimer, facilitating display selection against solid-supported SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. This enabled the discovery of potent inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>, including the 14-residue cyclic peptide <bold>1</bold> with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> of 14 nM that represents one of the most potent inhibitors reported against the protease to date. SEC-MALLS and NMR spectroscopic studies revealed that this molecule inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> by exclusively binding to the catalytic protease dimer, highlighting the importance of controlling the nature of the immobilized protein construct for display selections; in this case by covalently cross-linking the M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer. Co-crystal structures of M<sup>pro</sup> and <bold>1</bold> and the selenocysteine derivative <bold>Sec-1</bold> solved by X-ray crystallography revealed the canonical interaction between a Gln residue and subsite S1, flanked by hydrophobic residues. This half of the peptide was relatively stable, while the hydrophilic face (8–12) was relatively mobile, interacting with solvent and across the dimer interface to facilitate an exclusive dimer binding mode for the inhibitor. The strain imposed by cyclization prevents the peptide from adopting a fully relaxed conformation and likely explains the very slow turnover, despite the inhibitor possessing canonical residues that bind to the key recognition subsites of the protease. Thus, cyclization of the peptide has essentially converted a peptide substrate into a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, highlighting a key benefit of the cyclic peptides that emerge from RaPID screens in medicinal chemistry studies. Several of the cyclic peptides also exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and enhancing cellular uptake of cyclic peptides by conjugation to the CPP penetratin led to dramatic improvements in antiviral activity. This was especially pronounced for lead molecule <bold>1</bold>, which was ineffective without the covalent CPP tag but exhibited an EC<sub>50</sub> of 15.9 μM following fusion to penetratin. Taken together, these compounds now serve as bona fide starting points for the rational design of peptide- or peptidomimetic-based antivirals for COVID-19 that target SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Moreover, the crosslinked protease selection strategy developed as part of this work is expected to inform medicinal chemistry campaigns targeting other dimeric coronaviral main proteases. Future work in our laboratories will involve lead optimization of the discovered peptides for improved activity and cell permeability both by rational design and high-throughput affinity maturation<sup>

<p id="P29">HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells stably expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were generated as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
</sup>. A high content fluorescence microscopy approach was used to assess the ability of the cyclic peptide M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors to protect cells from SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathic effects in permissive cells. In brief, the engineered cell line succumbs to viral cytopathic effects after 6 to 18 hours post infection. Cytopathic effects can be enumerated, as cells and their nuclei collapse into large syncytia after 18 hours of viral culture. The remaining cells outside of the syncytia increase in a dose dependent manner the lower the viral titers are and/or if a viral inhibitor is introduced within the culture.</p>
<p id="P30">For testing the cyclic peptides, compounds were initially diluted in cell culture medium (DMEM-5% FCS) to make 4x working stock solutions and then serially diluted further in the above media to achieve a 2-fold dilution series. On the day of the assay, HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were trypsinized, stained with Nucblue in suspension and then seeded at 16,000 cells in a volume of 40 μL of DMEM-5% FCS per well in a 384-well plate (Corning #CLS3985). Diluted compounds (20 μL) were added to the cells and the plates containing cells and compounds incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 20 μL of virus solution at 8x10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> TCID50/mL <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
</sup> was then added to the wells and plates were incubated for a further 24 hours at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Stained cells were then imaged using the InCell 2500 (Cytiva) high throughput microscope, with a 10× 0.45 NA CFI Plan Apo Lambda air objective. Acquired nuclei were counted using InCarta high-content image analysis software (Cytiva) to give a quantitative measure of CPE. Virus inhibition/neutralization was calculated as %N= (D-(1-Q))x100/D, where; “Q” is the value of nuclei in test well divided by the average number of nuclei in untreated uninfected controls, and “D”=1-Q for the wells infected with virus but untreated with inhibitors. Thus, the average nuclear counts for the infected and uninfected cell controls get defined as 0% and 100% neutralization respectively. To account for cell death due to drug toxicity, cells treated with a given compound alone and without virus were included in each assay. The % neutralization for each compound concentration in infected wells was normalized to % neutralization in wells with equivalent amount of compound but without the virus to yield the final neutralization values for each condition. Inhibition curves and 50% (EC<sub>50</sub>) effective concentrations were determined by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software (version 9.1.2, GraphPad software, USA).</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity and targeted proteomics on HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cell line</title>
<p id="P31">HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L D-Glucose, L-Glutamine and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate (Gibco), supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Hyclone). Cells were sub-cultured between 70-90% confluency and tested regularly to ensure free of mycoplasma contamination. Cytotoxicity of <bold>1</bold>, <bold>pen-1</bold>, <bold>6</bold> and <bold>pen-6</bold>, was determined by an Alamar Blue HS (Invitrogen) cell viability assay as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded into wells of a 96-well flat bottom culture plate (Corning) and once adhered, compounds or vehicle control (DMSO) were added at varying concentrations and incubated for 24 hours (37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Alamar Blue HS cell viability reagent (Invitrogen) was added and the cells further incubated for 2-3 hours. Relative fluorescent units (RFU) were determined per well at ex/em 560/590 nm (Tecan Infinite M1000 pro plate reader). Increasing RFU is proportional to cell viability.</p>
<p id="P32">For targeted proteomics, cells in 6-well plates at 70% confluency were treated with vehicle control (DMSO) or inhibitors at 10 μM. At various time points (performed in triplicate), the cells were washed 3 times with 2 mL DPBS (Gibco), scraped and lysed in 4% SDC buffer (4% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0) then immediately heated to 95 °C for 10 mins before freezing at -30 °C prior to processing for targeted proteomics<sup>

<bold>a SEC-MALLS of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with and without peptide 1.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (red line) exists in equilibrium between monomeric and homodimeric forms giving rise to two peaks (in ca. 1:1.25 ratio of monomer to dimer) in the size-exclusion chromatogram at a concentration of 1 μM in aqueous buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). MALLS analysis indicates an approximate molecular weight of 36 kDa for the monomer (calculated molecular weight = 33.8 kDa). After addition of two molar equivalents of <bold>1</bold>, M<sup>pro</sup> converges predominantly to a homodimer (blue line) with a MALLS reading of 66 kDa (calculated MW of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> dimer = 67.6 kDa, MW of peptide <bold>1</bold> = 1874 Da) indicative of formation of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer upon binding <bold>1</bold>. <bold>b Cyclic peptide inhibitor 1 binds to the dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</bold> Overlay of projections onto the <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H plane of 3D TROSY-HNCO spectra of 0.3 mM solutions of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>2</sup>H-labelled wild-type M<sup>pro</sup>.
