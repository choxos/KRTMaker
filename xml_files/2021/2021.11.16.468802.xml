Cellular hydrolysis of their active triphosphate forms, Remdesivir-TP and Molnupiravir-TP, would decrease drug efficiency. We therefore tested Remdesivir-TP as a substrate against a panel of human hydrolases and found that NUDT18 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP. The k<sub>cat</sub> value of NUDT18 for Remdesivir-TP was determined to 2.6 s<sup>-1</sup> and the K<sub>m</sub> value was 156 μM, suggesting that NUDT18 catalyzed hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP occurs in cells. We demonstrate that the triphosphates of the antivirals Ribavirin and Molnupiravir are hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit with a lower efficiency compared to Remdesivir-TP. NUDT18 also hydrolyses the triphosphates of Sofosbuvir and Aciclovir although with significantly lower activity. These results suggest that NUDT18 can act as a cellular sanitizer of modified nucleotides and may influence the antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir, Molnupiravir and Ribavirin. NUDT18 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells and may limit the antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir and Molnupiravir against SARS-CoV2 replication by decreasing the intracellular concentration of their active metabolites at their intended site of action.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nucleotide hydrolysis</kwd><kwd>NUDIX hydrolase</kwd><kwd>NUDT18</kwd><kwd>Remdesivir</kwd><kwd>Ribavirin</kwd><kwd>Molnupiravir</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its fast worldwide spread and high mortality rate led to major efforts to repurpose already approved antiviral drugs in order to quickly control the outbreak and thereby save lives. Remdesivir (GS-5734) was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola but is a broad-acting antiviral which has been found to reduce the replication of coronaviruses both in cell culture and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Remdesivir treatment was shown to decrease the severity of disease after MERS-CoV infection via decreasing virus replication and thereby reducing damage to the lungs when administered both before and after infection in a rhesus macaque model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Recently, Remdesivir was tested in several clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir was shown to shorten the recovery time of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 as well as reducing mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and suggested to be most effective if administered early after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Remdesivir was the first drug to be approved for treatment of severe COVID-19 in July 2020 by the European Medicine Agency and later in the fall by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Remdesivir is a prodrug in the form of a protected phosphate that upon cell entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, step 1) is metabolized by cellular enzymes to the corresponding monophosphate (GS-441524, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, step 2). The monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its active triphosphate form (Remdesivir-TP, aka GS-443902, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, step 3). The antiviral effect of Remdesivir-TP is mediated through its incorporation into the growing virus RNA chain by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, step 4). Incorporation of the Remdesivir metabolite causes the polymerase to stall and RNA replication to be terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, step 5), leading to a decrease in the production of viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) was in November 2021 given a temporary authorization by the UK’s medicines regulatory authority for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults at risk for severe disease and one month later an emergency use authorization was issued by the FDA. Administration of this orally active drug lead to a clear reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as quicker recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In addition, early treatment with Molnupiravir clearly reduced the risk of death or hospitalization in unvaccinated adults with COVID-19 at risk for severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Molnupiravir is a prodrug for β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, which previously has been shown to be effective against various RNA viruses including influenza and other coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and is rapidly hydrolyzed to β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine followed by phosphorylation resulting in formation of its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The incorporation of β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine triphosphate, hereafter called Molnupiravir-TP, by RdRp into viral RNA causes a drastic increase in the mutation frequency resulting in a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Ribavirin is another antiviral drug that was tested for activity towards SARS-CoV-2. Ribavirin has since the 1970s been known to act as a broad-spectrum antiviral of both DNA and RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. It has been used in combination with IFN-α-based therapy to treat hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] as well as other viral infections such as Lassa fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], Crimean–Congo fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and chronic hepatitis E virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Ribavirin in combination with IFN-β was shown to synergistically inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus replication in animal and human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] suggesting that Ribavirin could be a potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2. The precise mode of action of Ribavirin is not completely understood and its metabolites have been suggested to target several processes of which the antiviral impact may depend on their intracellular concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, it is known that Ribavirin-MP inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase leading to GTP depletion with effects on many cellular processes. Ribavirin-TP has been hypothesized to directly inhibit viral RNA dependent polymerase and may at higher concentrations also cause mutations in the viral genome. Ribavirin-TP is hydrolyzed by the ITPase hydrolase and patients carrying alleles encoding low activity ITPase variants display a reduced risk of hepatitis C relapse, suggesting that these patients have higher concentrations of the active Ribavirin metabolite. Furthermore, low activity ITPase alleles have been shown to protect against anemia acquired upon INF-α and Ribavirin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The ITPase activity-dependent outcome of Ribavirin treatment strongly emphasizes the impact of cellular metabolism on drug efficacy. Similar to ITPase, several NUDIX enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of modified nucleoside triphosphates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and have been shown to modulate the efficacy of various drugs including antivirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. An example is NUDT15 which we recently reported catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ganciclovir-TP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. In a similar way, hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP into Remdesivir-MP, catalyzed by a human nucleotide hydrolase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Step 6) would reduce the cellular concentration of the active metabolite. Moreover, conversion of Remdesivir-MP to the corresponding nucleoside through the action of 5’-nucleotidase would enable transport out of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Step 7) and further decrease the antiviral potency of Remdesivir. In order to investigate if such a hydrolase could be found within the NUDIX family of enzymes we tested Remdesivir-TP as substrate for a panel of human NUDIX hydrolases and found that NUDT18 catalyzed the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP. Encouraged by this we tested NUDT18 for activity towards several antiviral triphosphates and found NUDT18 to also be an efficient catalyst of Ribavirin-TP and Molnupiravir-TP hydrolysis. NUDT18 has to date only been described to display activity towards 8-oxo-(d)GDP and has therefore been suggested to cleanse the nucleotide pool from oxidatively damaged nucleotides, preventing their incorporation into DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The results of this study suggest that NUDT18 acts as a cellular sanitizer in a broader sense and contributes to removing modified nucleotides of both endogenous and exogenous origin, and potentially modulates the efficiency of the antiviral drugs Remdesivir, Molnupiravir and Ribavirin.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>NUDT18 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP</title><p id="P6">In order to investigate if human NUDIX enzymes can modulate the cellular concentration of the active metabolite of Remdesivir and thereby reduce its efficacy as antiviral drug we tested human MTH1, NUDT5, NUDT9, NUDT15 and NUDT18 for hydrolysis activity with Remdesivir-TP. Among these NUDIX hydrolases only NUDT18 was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). NUDT18 was shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of both the bond between the α- and β-phosphate groups, generating PPi, as well as the bond between the β- and γ-phosphate groups, generating Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This was evidenced by an increase in the amount of Pi formed in the presence of PPase, which hydrolyzes PPi. Based on the described activity of ITPase with Ribavirin-TP, which constitutes one of the active metabolites of the antiviral Ribavirin, we argued that ITPase may also hydrolyze other antiviral triphosphates. We therefore tested human ITPase as well as the human hydrolases dCTPase and dUTPase for activity with Remdesivir-TP. Human dCTPase displayed low but measurable activity with Remdesivir-TP while no activity was detected with dUTPase or ITPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Comparison with NUDT18 activity towards 8-oxo-dGDP showed an approximately 2-fold higher specific activity compared to Remdesivir-TP at 100 μM substrate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The observed activity of NUDT18 with Remdesivir-TP prompted us to test other antiviral triphosphates as substrates for NUDT18. We found that Ribavirin-TP is also hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit not to the same extent as Remdesvir-TP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar to Remdesivir-TP, NUDT18 catalyzed Ribavirin-TP hydrolysis results in the production of both Ribavirin di- and monophosphate, as shown by an increase in the signal when PPase was included in the assay buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). NUDT18 was also shown to hydrolyze Molnupiravir-TP. As evidenced by a 5-fold higher production of Pi in the presence of PPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), Molnupiravir-TP hydrolysis of the bond between the α- and β-phosphate groups appears to be preferred. In addition, NUDT15, previously shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of Ganciclovir-TP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of Molnupiravir-TP producing pyrophosphate, albeit with considerably lower efficiency compared to NUDT18, while MTH1 did not display any detectable activity with this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To investigate the activity of NUDT18 with these substrates in more detail we performed kinetic analyses of the NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP, Ribavirin-TP, Molnupiravir-TP and for comparison with 8-oxo-dGDP. Enzyme activities were assayed under identical conditions and enzyme saturation curves using these substrates were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B, C and D</xref>) and kinetic parameters were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). The K<sub>m</sub> value for NUDT18 was determined to be 16.5 μM for 8-oxo-dGDP, which is in agreement with a previously published K<sub>m</sub> value of 12 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The k<sub>cat</sub> value for 8-oxo-dGDP at 22°C was determined to be 1.8 s<sup>-1</sup> and the calculated k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value was 109,800 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. The K<sub>m</sub> value for Remdesivir-TP was determined to be 156 μM (n=2) and the k<sub>cat</sub> value was 2.6 s<sup>-1</sup> resulting in a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value of 17,700 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. The approximately 6-fold higher catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value) of NUDT18 for 8-oxo-dGDP means that 8-oxo-dGDP would be the preferred substrate over Remdesivir-TP at the same concentration. However, the concentration of Remdesivir in monkey lung cell tissue post IV administration was estimated to be 800 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Based on an estimation of the intracellular 8-oxo-dGTP concentration of 2 nM in U2OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], and the assumption that the cellular concentration of 8-oxo-dGDP is likely in a similar range or lower, it is likely that the cellular Remdesivir-TP concentration is at least 100-fold higher than the concentration of 8-oxo-dGDP <italic>in vivo</italic>. This suggests that the activity of NUDT18 with Remdesivir-TP may be of relevance for modulating the Remdesivir-TP concentration in cells.</p><p id="P8">When comparing Remdesivir-TP, Ribavirin-TP and Molnupiravir-TP as substrates for NUDT18, Remdesivir-TP appears to be the preferred substrate. NUDT18 displays a k<sub>cat</sub> value for Ribavirin-TP hydrolysis that is approximately 1 s<sup>-1</sup> and a K<sub>m</sub> value of 111 μM, resulting in a catalytic efficiency value of 8,800 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>, which is approximately half of the corresponding value for Remdesivir-TP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). The catalytic efficiency of NUDT18 for Molnupiravir-TP was determined to 8,800 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>, which is very close to the corresponding value for Ribavirin-TP. However, the affinity for Molnupiravir-TP seems to be 2-fold higher (K<sub>m</sub>=57 μM) while the turnover number is 2-fold lower (k<sub>cat</sub>=0.49 s<sup>-1</sup>). Comparison of the kinetic parameters of Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP with those for 8-oxo-dGDP show that the difference primarily lies in the K<sub>m</sub> value suggesting a better fit of 8-oxo-dGDP in the active site of NUDT18.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NUDT18 catalyzes the hydrolysis of other antiviral triphosphates</title><p id="P9">In order to investigate if NUDT18 can catalyze the hydrolysis of other antiviral triphosphates we expanded the substrate screen of NUDT18 and found that Sofosbuvir-TP, Aciclovir-TP, Ganciclovir-TP as well as Gemcitabin-TP are hydrolyzed by NUDT18 to some extent. Similar to the NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP, hydrolysis takes place at both the β-γ and the α-β phosphate bonds in these substrates with approximately 50% of the hydrolysis taking place at each of these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, kinetic analysis revealed that the activity with Aciclovir-TP, the best substrate in this panel, is much lower compared to the activity with Remdesivir-TP with a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value approximately 5 times lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). However, the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value was 2.2 times higher than the corresponding k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> value for dGTP. The fact that Aciclovir contains a guanine moiety like dGTP indicates that the higher activity of NUDT18 with Aciclovir-TP compared to dGTP lies in NUDT18 being able to better accommodate the nucleobase and the modified sugar part of Aciclovir-TP in the active site. This in turn enables a more productive positioning of the phosphate groups for hydrolysis. This is reflected by a 2.6 times higher turnover number (k<sub>cat</sub>) for Aciclovir-TP compared to dGTP, while the K<sub>m</sub> values are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, whether the activity of NUDT18 with these antiviral triphosphates bears clinical relevance for modulating the potency of these antivirals needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Investigation of binding mode in NUDT18</title><p id="P10">Remdesivir-TP contains a nitrile group on the C1 atom of the ribose unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that none of the other tested NUDIX proteins displays any activity with Remdesivir-TP suggests that only the active site of NUDT18 is spacious enough and contains amino acids enabling accommodation of this moiety while still orienting the rest of the molecule allowing for efficient hydrolysis. To date two crystal structures of human NUDT18 have been reported (PDB IDs: 3gg6 and 4hvy), both comprising apo structures of truncated constructs covering residue positions 26-179. Analysis of these structures using SiteMap [SiteMap, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2021] indicated that the largest pocket adjacent to the helix containing the NUDIX motif is relatively small and polar in comparison to other NUDIX family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Docking of Remdesivir-TP to this site did not yield any good-scoring poses with plausible accommodation of the heterocyclic core of Remdesivir-TP. In comparison, the homologous NUDIX family members NUDT1 and NUDT15 contain deeper druggable pockets which readily accommodate nucleobases and small-molecule inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. This suggests that considerable conformational changes are required for NUDT18 to harbor the heterocyclic cores of Remdesivir-TP and other substrates. Attempts to induce a deeper hydrophobic pocket using an induced-fit procedure as described by Loving <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] also failed to generate a pocket for Remdesivir-TP with significantly improved SiteScore.</p><p id="P11">In order to obtain structural information to understand the binding mode of NUDT18 substrates we carried out extensive crystallization trials of full length NUDT18 without added ligands or together with 8-oxo-dGDP, Remdesivir-TP or Ribavirin-TP. This included seven different commercially available crystallization screens (JCSG+, INDEX, Morpheus, Morpheus II, Pact Premier, Structure Screen and Salt-RX) using different protein concentrations (ranging from 5 mg/mL to 25 mg/mL) and temperatures (4 °C and 20 °C). Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain crystals in any of the conditions tested. As only structures of the nucleosidase binding domain are available for NUDT18 it is possible that the second domain and linking region renders the full-length protein too flexible for crystallization. We performed a structural similarity search using the DALI web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], which indicated that hNUDT18 is most structurally similar to human and other eukaryotic MTH1 proteins from dogs, mice and zebrafish (with rms differences of 2.1 to 2.3 Å). As Remdesivir-TP is an analogue of ATP we were particularly interested in comparing the existing hNUDT18 nucleotidase domain structure (PDB ID: 3gg6) with structures of hMTH1 bound to N6-methyl-dAMP (PDB ID: 6qvo, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and 2-OH-dATP (PDB ID: 5ghq, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Comparison of these structures showed that residues from the highly conserved NUDIX motif (GX5EX7REVXEEXGU) that coordinate the essential magnesium ions required for substrate hydrolysis superimpose nicely between the structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). This provides some level of certainty as to where the α-phosphate group of Remdesivir-TP would be positioned in hNUDT18 and therefore the orientation of the ligand within the binding pocket. Analysis of the hNUDT18 structure reveals a shallow binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) and structural rearrangements are clearly required to accommodate the adenine base. Analysis of N6-methyl-dAMP and 2-OH-dATP binding in MTH1 shows that the residue W117* forms an important pi-stacking interaction with the adenine base. In NUDT18 the corresponding residue is an alanine, however a tyrosine residue (Y72, N33* in hMTH1) which would be capable of performing an equivalent pi-stacking interaction is situated in close proximity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). In the NUDT18 apo structure Y72 clashes with the bound base when compared to the positioning of the ligands in the hMTH1 structures. A conformational adjustment must occur in order to make room for the substrate. Repositioning of this tyrosine would shape the binding pocket in such a way that it, while still being shallow, is capable of accommodating N6-methyl-dAMP and 2-OH-dATP and importantly, Remdesivir-TP with its additional nitrile group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). The lower K<sub>m</sub> value of 8-oxo-dGDP for NUDT18 suggests it fits better within the active site of the enzyme than Remdesivir-TP. In the absence of a full-length NUDT18 structure, a structure of the NUDT18 nucleotidase domain bound to the natural substrate 8-oxo-dGDP or to Remdesivir-TP would be very useful for elucidating the exact structural rearrangements that occur within the nucleotide binding site upon binding of these ligands.</p><p id="P12">In an attempt to understand which structural features of the substrates that influence their quality as NUDT18 substrates, we compared their values of catalytic efficiency and turnover numbers of NUDT18 catalyzed hydrolysis for the tested substrates relative to the corresponding values for dGTP and examined the chemical structures of the tested substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). NUDT18 has previously been reported to catalyze the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGDP and 8-oxo-GDP with the same efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], demonstrating that the 2’-OH group can be accommodated in the active site of NUDT18. This suggests a flexibility towards alterations within this part of the nucleoside substrate. Among the tested substrates, the turnover number is highest for Remdesivir-TP suggesting that either NUDT18 catalyzed hydrolysis or product release is faster for Remdesivir-TP compared to 8-oxo-dGDP under substrate saturating conditions. However, the K<sub>m</sub> value is considerably lower for 8-oxo-dGDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating specific interactions between the oxidized nucleobase and active site residues of NUDT18. The lower K<sub>m</sub> value, which translates into higher catalytic efficiency for 8-oxo-dGDP, may in part be due to nucleoside triphosphates binding with lower affinity to the active site compared to nucleoside diphosphates. The difference in catalytic efficiency between Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP can likely be attributed to differences in positioning for efficient hydrolysis and/or product release since their K<sub>m</sub> values are similar. The lower k<sub>cat</sub> value for Molnupiravir-TP compared to Remdesivir-TP indicates a less efficient binding of Molnupiravir-TP for productive catalysis. The NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of Molnupiravir-TP seems to take place mostly at the α-β phosphate bond while in the case of Remdesivir-TP hydrolysis occurs at both the β-γ and the α-β phosphate bonds to approximately the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) suggesting that accommodation of the N4-hydroxycytidine moiety of Molnupiravir-TP in the active site is more restricted in comparison to binding of the bicyclic triazin moiety of Remdesivir-TP. Interactions between the nucleobase and/or the nitrile group of Remdesivir-TP and NUDT18 may contribute to a more productive binding. However, in absence of structural information, it is difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the binding mode. Nevertheless, the fact that the active site of NUDT18 can accommodate molecules with rather different structures and that hydrolysis takes place at two positions with equal efficiency, with the exception of Molnupiravir-TP, indicates a relatively flexible binding mode for these substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inhibition of NUDIX enzymes by Remdesivir and metabolites</title><p id="P13">Since Remdesivir-TP is a substrate for NUDT18 we argued that Remdesivir and its metabolites may inhibit NUDT18 and related NUDIX proteins. We therefore tested MTH1 and NUDT15 for inhibition by Remdesivir, the Remdesivir metabolite GS-441524 (arising from cellular hydrolysis of Remdesivir) and Remdesivir-TP. We tested NUDT18 for inhibition by Remdesivir and GS-441524. NUDT15 was found to be modestly inhibited by 100 μM Remdesivir (26%) as well as by GS-441524 (21 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). MTH1 was slightly inhibited by GS-441524 (23%) while no inhibition of NUDT18 by any of the tested Remdesivir derivatives was observed. The modest inhibitory effect of Remdesivir and its metabolites imply that Remdesivir treatment is unlikely to have a pronounced effect on the cellular activity of these enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Consequence of NUDT18 activity with antiviral triphosphates</title><p id="P14">The results presented here suggest that NUDT18 can convert Remdesivir-TP to Remdesivir-DP and Remdesivir-MP in the cell. However, since Remdesivir-DP and Remdesivir-MP are substrates for adenylate kinase 2 they will be phosphorylated and a cellular equilibrium between production of Remdesivir-TP by kinases and hydrolysis catalyzed by NUDT18 is likely established. Furthermore, the action of intracellular 5’-nucleotidase will affect the concentration of Remdesivir-MP. In a similar way the cellular concentrations of the metabolites of Molnupiravir and Ribavirin will be regulated by the activities of adenylate kinase 2 and NUDT18 and in the case of Ribavirin also ITPase. For NUDT18 to play a clinically relevant role in modulating Remdesivir efficacy it has to be present in the cells that are infected by the virus. Importantly, NUDT18 is ubiquitously expressed, displays low tissue specificity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000275074-NUDT18">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000275074-NUDT18</ext-link>) and is expressed in lung and in respiratory epithelial cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home</ext-link>). This suggests that NUDT18 would be able to modulate the effective concentration of Remdesivir-TP and Molnupiravir-TP at their intended site of action. Potentially, inhibition of NUDT18 would be a means to increase the efficacy of these drugs. However, no NUDT18 inhibitors enabling such investigations are available to the best of our knowledge.</p><p id="P15">The importance of intracellular metabolism for efficiency of antivirals is exemplified by the activity of human ITPase with Ribavirin-TP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Approximately a third of the human population carries low activity ITPase alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and it is clear that cellular ITPase activity influences the antiviral efficacy of Ribavirin as well as its adverse effects. Similarly, higher expression of NUDT18 in respiratory epithelial cells in a COVID-19 patient, potentially resulting in considerable Remdesivir-TP and Molnupiravir-TP hydrolysis, may result in lower efficiency of the corresponding antivirals compared to in a patient with lower NUDT18 expression levels. This may explain differences in response to Remdesivir treatment between patients.</p><p id="P16">Here we show that human NUDT18 can catalyze the hydrolysis of the active metabolites of the antivirals Remdesivir, Ribavirin and Molnupiravir. These novel NUDT18 activities may be clinically relevant and warrants further investigation and emphasizes the need for NUDT18-specific inhibitors enabling studies of the cellular NUDT18 function and role in modulating the efficacy of these antiviral drugs.</p><p id="P17">In summary, we suggest a cellular role of NUDT18 as a sanitizer of modified nucleotides, including antiviral triphosphates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Protein production</title><p id="P18">MTH1, NUDT15, NUDT18, NUDT5 and NUDT9, and <italic>E. coli</italic> PPase were produced as N-terminally His-tagged proteins and were expressed and purified by the Protein Science Facility, Karolinska Institute, using Ni-IMAC (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare) followed by gel filtration (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 or HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 100, GE Healthcare) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].
