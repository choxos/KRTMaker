We examined indices of development and adult behaviour in a mouse model of <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency, revealing a complex pattern of sex-related differences spanning the pre-and post-natal period. Specifically, male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice had smaller placentae at E11.5 and females at E18.5 without any apparent changes in foetal size. In contrast, young male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice had lower body weight and showed enhanced growth, leading to equivalent weights by adulthood. Embryonic whole brain RNA-seq analysis revealed expression changes that were significantly enriched for mitochondria-related genes in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/</sup> samples. In adulthood, we found enhanced acoustic startle responding in male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice which was insentitive to the effects of risperidone, but not haloperidol, both commonly used antipsychotic drugs. We also observed reduced pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle, a schizophrenia-relevant phenotype, in both male and female <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice which could not be rescued by either drug. In the open field and elevated plus maze tests of anxiety, <italic>Setd1a</italic> haplosufficiency led to more anxiogenic behaviour in both sexes, whereas there were no differences in general motoric ability and memory. Thus, we find evidence for changes in a number of phenotypes which strengthen the support for the use of <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficient mice as a model for the biological basis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, our data point towards possible underpinning neural and developmental mechanisms that may be subtly different between the sexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SETD1A</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>developmental delay</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>startle response</kwd><kwd>prepulse inhibition</kwd><kwd>haloperidol</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Epigenetic modifications controlling chromatin structure and organisation, can enhance or suppress gene expression dependent on the mechanism in action. Methylation of lysine residue 4 on histone 3 (H3K4), generally considered an activating histone mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], is catalysed by a histone methyltransferase complex, of which <italic>SETD1A</italic> (SET Domain Containing 1A) is an essential subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. <italic>SETD1A</italic> has been implicated in a range of biological functions, including cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and neuronal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], highlighting a wide distribution across different cell types, throughout different stages of development and during adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Exome sequencing studies have implicated loss of function (LoF) mutations in the <italic>SETD1A</italic> gene that increase susceptibility for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and conditions, including developmental delay, early-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While these genetic variants are rare (occurring in 0.13 % of schizophrenia cases), they are highly penetrant and their effects on gene function (i.e. haploinsufficiency) can be recapitulated in model systems. Consequently, <italic>SETD1A</italic> provides a biologically tractable target for disease modelling.</p><p id="P3">Homozygous knock-out of <italic>Setd1a</italic> is embryonically lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, non-human models have targeted haploinsufficiency (<italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup>), with current mouse models employing either frameshift mutations to exon 7 or 15 or disruption to exon 4 via an upstream LacZ/Neo cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] to investigate the mechanisms of Setd1a function and how it might influence NDD. Haploinsufficiency also recapitulates the clinical LoF mutations found in human conditions for more direct translational impact. From a neurobiological perspective, changes including axonal branching deficits, impaired synaptic plasticity, regionally-specific gene expression changes linked to morphology and dendritic complexity, synapse formation, and abnormal cortical ensemble activity have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. <italic>Setd1a</italic> may also have a role in regulating the balance between neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) proliferation and differentiation in neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], suggesting that perturbations to this balance may play a role in pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>Setd1a</italic> LoF in neurodevelopmental disorders. Behaviour in these models has also been affected, with impairments in working and spatial memory, sensorimotor gating, hyperactivity, and altered juvenile social behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Other work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that shortand long-term courtship memory is impaired by conditional knockdown of Set1 in neurons of the mushroom body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Setd1a may have important roles in early development, as shown in the maternal high-fat diet model in mice, a manipulation that is associated with schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], where <italic>Setd1a</italic> expression is reduced in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. There is further evidence that Setd1a can influence placental function and development from studies in <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficient mice via its actions on embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], with some evidence of gestational compromise though no differences in growth to adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Based on these findings, it might be predicted that <italic>SETD1A</italic> LoF causes disturbed neurodevelopment with downstream consequences for later brain function that contribute to the emergence of atypical patterns of behaviour and psychopathology, possibly via effects on placental function.</p><p id="P5">Therefore, using a newly created mouse model of Setd1a haploinsufficiency, where Setd1a is disrupted in exon 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], we investigate how deletion of Setd1a may influence pre- and post-natal growth and behaviours in adulthood. In this model, we have previously demonstrated downregulation in genes enriched for mitochondrial pathways in frontal cortex from E14 to P70, but no differential enrichment in genes associated with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], here we replicate these results at a similar time point (E13.5). We also find evidence for sex-linked developmental changes that extend into early post-natal growth, with effects on male and female embryo:placenta ratios that suggest imbalance in demand and delivery capacity at different foetal ages, and in and male post-weaning catch-up growth. In terms of adult behaviour, we found evidence for an enhanced acoustic startle response in male Setd1a<sup>+/-</sup> mice and increased anxiety-related behaviour in both male and female Setd1a<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response was attenuated in both sexes. However, the sensorimotor gating deficits could not be rescued by haloperidol or risperidone, suggesting that these antipsychotic agents are ineffective for ameliorating schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Taken together our findings strengthen the support for the use of <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficient mice as a model for the biological basis of schizophrenia and point towards possible underpinning neural mechanisms, that may be sexually dimorphic.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P6">All procedures were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice were produced using a strain created by the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. To generate a model with a constitutive germline transmissible knockout allele, male C57BL/6NTac-Setd1a<sup>tm1c(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup>/WtsiCnrm mice (obtained from MRC Harwell) were paired with female B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. F1 male progeny were genotyped to identify animals heterozygous for the Setd1a<sup>CMV-cre/+</sup> allele. These were crossed with C57BL/6J females (obtained from Charles River) to enable removal of the X-linked CMV-cre transgene from males in the F2 generation. Experimental cohorts were generated by pairing male F2 <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice with C57BL/6J females (wildtype, WT). These mice show haploinsufficiency as demonstrated by a 48.8% reduction in mRNA at E13.5 in <italic>Setd1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> brain compared to WT, with comparable reductions in levels of SETD1A protein (46.3% reduction) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods Figure 1</xref>). Animals for the assessment of post-natal growth (N=84) and behavioural studies (N=77 and N=56) were housed in mixed-genotype cages with littermates of the same sex (2-5 per cage) in a vivarium maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle (lights on from 08:00-20:00) at a temperature of 21 (± 2) °C and 50 (± 10) % humidity.

E13.5 tissue was selected based on the results of the developmental expression work, which showed highest expression levels at this timepoint, and to supplement the data in Clifton et al (2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Detailed methods can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods Figure 2</xref>. In brief, following sample purification, concentration and integrity assessment Library preparations were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (KAPA mRNA Hyperprep kit. Roche, Switzerland) with 1 μg total RNA as input. Library concentrations were adjusted prior to pooling to achieve a final DNA molarity of 20 nM and sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, USA) with 75 bp paired-end reads at a read depth of 30 million reads. Reads were trimmed to remove adapters and low-quality bases, and passed FastQC quality control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], before mapping to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) using STAR (mean number of reads mapped was 97.2%, SD = 0.5%). Read counts, generated using featureCounts were allocated to genomic features using the mouse Ensembl gene annotation (GRCm.38.95). Differential expression analysis was performed using DEseq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] implemented in R (version 3.5.3).

The second cohort of mice (males: WT, N=16, <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, N=10 and females: WT, N=17, <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, N=13), was first used to test whether the effects of <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency on ASR and PPI observed in the first cohort could be replicated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Results Figure 3</xref>). These mice were then randomly divided into two approximately equal groups (balanced for sex and genotype, see Fig. 3 for n) and allocated to either the haloperidol or risperidone condition, to test the effects of these antipsychotics on sensorimotor gating impairments. All apparatus was cleaned with 70 % (v/v) ethanol between animals, and testing was conducted under dimmed lighting (15 lux) except for locomotor activity which was run in the dark.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Sensorimotor gating</title><p id="P11">The acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were measured using apparatus from SR-Lab (San Diego Instruments, USA). Animals were placed in a clear Perspex tube (35 mm internal diameter) mounted on a Perspex plinth in a sound-attenuating chamber. A 70 dB (A scale) white noise stimulus was continuously played throughout the session via a loudspeaker positioned 120 mm above the tube. The whole-body startle response was detected on each trial by a piezoelectric sensor attached to the plinth, which transduced flexion in the plinth into a digitised signal. The average startle response (Vavg) was recorded in arbitrary startle units using SR-Lab software over the 65 ms period following stimulus onset. Startle data were weight-adjusted by dividing Vavg by body weight recorded immediately after the test session. PPI was calculated as the percentage reduction in startle amplitude between prepulse and pulse-alone trials (excluding the first three pulse-alone trials). Each session of 96 trials, started with a five-minute habituation period, and was divided into three blocks. Pulse amplitude was set to 120 dB and 105 dB in block 1 and block 2, respectively and the third block comprised a range of pulse-alone trials (80 – 120 dB in 10 dB increments), with three of each trial type. Acoustic stimuli were presented with a mean intertrial interval of 16 seconds (pseudorandomly varied between 6 and 24 seconds). Each pulse-alone trial consisted of a 40 ms 120db or 105db startle stimulus. Prepulse trials consisted of a 20 ms prepulse stimulus followed by a 40 ms startle stimulus 80 ms after prepulse offset. In the first two blocks, 6 consecutive pulse-alone trials were presented followed by 7 additional pulse-alone trials interspersed with 18 prepulse trials (either 4, 8 or 16 dB (above background) with six trials of each prepulse amplitude). Only the data from 120 dB pulse alone and the 8 and 16 dB prepulse trials are reported here for brevity, but all raw data are available in the online repository. For the pharmacological investigations using the second cohort of mice, with haloperidol and risperidone, a reduced session protocol was used, whereby all 4 dB prepulse trials and all trials with 105 dB stimuli were removed.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Anxiety-related behaviour</title><p id="P12">The OFT and EPM were used to assess anxiety-related behaviour under identical lighting conditions (15 lux) and the position of each mouse in the apparatus was tracked using EthoVision XT software (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands) at a rate of 12 frames/s via a camera mounted above the centre of each piece of apparatus. The OFT comprised a 750 x 750 mm arena with 45 cm white Perspex walls. Each animal was placed in the same corner of the arena and allowed to explore freely for 10 minutes. The arena was divided into two, concentric virtual zones: the ‘inner zone’ (central 600 x 600 mm) and the ‘outer zone’ (surrounding 150 mm). The EPM was constructed of white Perspex and consisted of four arms of equal size (175 x 78 mm) extending from a central square region (78 x 78 mm) and positioned 450 mm above the floor. Two of the arms were ‘open’ (no walls) and two were enclosed by 150 mm high opaque walls. Arms of the same type were diametrically opposed. Each animal was placed in the same enclosed arm at the start of the trial and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for five minutes. Measures of anxiety were the patterns of exploration between the different arms or zones of the apparatus, with particular focus on the time in the central zone of the OFT and the latency to enter and time on the open arms of the EPM. Other measures included total distance moved, zone or arm transitions and the numbers of head dips and stretch attend postures made by the mice on the EPM.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Locomotor activity</title><p id="P13">Locomotor activity levels were assessed using previous methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], with the mice placed into clear Perspex chambers (210 x 360 x 200 mm) with two transverse infrared beams positioned 30 mm from either end of the chamber and 10 mm above the floor of the chamber. The apparatus was linked to a computer using ARACHNID software (Cambridge Cognition Ltd., UK). Activity levels were recorded as the number of beam breaks during each session using a custom programme (BBC BASIC Version 6).

The rod (30 mm diameter) was coated with rubber grooves to provide grip. Each animal completed five trials across two days (three trials on day one and two trials the next day). During each 5 minutes trial, the speed of rotation increased from 5 – 50 rpm at a constant rate of 0.15 rpm/s. The latency to fall was recorded on each trial, when a mouse caused a timer to stop when triggered by a lever (160 mm below the rod). On trials where the animal stayed on the rod for the duration of the trial, the latency to fall was recorded as the maximum trial length.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Novel object recognition</title><p id="P15">Recognition memory was assessed using the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] with retention intervals of 30 minutes and 24 hours. All mice completed the experiment at both the 30 minute and 24 hours retention interval, with order counterbalanced across animals and at least 24 hours between each condition. For the second test session, new objects that had not been encountered previously were placed in the quadrants of the arena that were unoccupied in the previous session. Location of the objects and allocation of objects to retention interval were counterbalanced across animals. Testing was conducted in a white Perspex arena (300 x 300 mm) with 300 mm high walls, and objects were common household items (bottles, cans, containers) of approximately the same size (120, x 50 mm). Prior to testing, mice were habituated to the empty arena for 10 minutes per day over three consecutive days. Each test session comprised three phases, conducted over one of two days as appropriate, and between phases mice were returned to a holding cage in the test room. The ‘habituation phase’, where the mice explored the empty arena for 10 minutes, preceded the ‘acquisition phase’, in which mice were returned to the arena and allowed to explore two identical objects (in diagonally opposite quadrants of the arena, 105 mm from the corner) for up to 15 minutes. To control for potential differences in object neophobia that could contribute to subsequent memory performance, the total amount of object exploration (defined as when the animal’s head was within 20 mm and oriented towards the object) was timed during the trial by the experimenter. The acquisition phase was ended once 40 seconds of object exploration was achieved or the maximum trial length had elapsed. Animals were then returned to either a holding cage or their home cage for a retention interval of 30 minutes or 24 hours. In the ‘test phase’, mice were placed back in the arena with one of the objects that they had been exposed to during the acquisition phase (‘familiar’) and another object that had not been encountered previously (‘novel’). The objects were presented in the same locations as the acquisition phase, and the mice allowed to explore freely for five minutes, and the amount of familiar and novel object exploration was recorded manually by the experimenter using EthoVision XT software (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands). The main measure of novel object recognition was a discrimination ratio (d1) calculated from the object contact times for each test session, with the following equation: novel/novel+familiar.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Drug preparation and administration</title><p id="P16">Haloperidol (Sigma, UK) and risperidone (Sigma, UK) were initially dissolved in 1M glacial acetic acid and then diluted in 0.9 % saline such that an equal volume (100 μL per gram of bodyweight) was administered for each injection.

This regimen and these doses were selected based previous studies [34.35] and pilot dose-response data showing that a 0.5 mg/kg dose of either haloperidol or risperidone did not have significant effects on sensorimotor gating in WT C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods Figure 3</xref>).

ASR data were analysed using ANOVA with GENOTYPE and SEX as between-subjects factors, and PPI data were analysed with PPI-INTENSITY (8 dB and 16 dB) as an additional within-subjects factor. Effects of haloperidol and risperidone were analysed separately by ANOVA with GENOTYPE and SEX as between-subjects factors and a within-subjects factor of DOSE (vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg). Data from the EPM and OFT were analysed by MANOVA with between-subject factors of GENOTYPE and SEX, and additional within-subjects factors of ZONE (central, outer) or ARM (open, closed) were included to assess exploration across the OFT or EPM, respectively. Data from one female WT animal was excluded from analysis of the OFT because it was identified as a multivariate outlier. Locomotor activity, rotarod and NOR data were analysed using ANOVAs with between-subject factors of GENOTYPE and SEX and the additional within-subjects factors of DAY (3 levels), TRIAL (5 levels) or DELAY (30 minutes and 24 hours), respectively. Data from one male WT subject was missing from the NOR due to a technical issue during testing. Greenhouse Geisser corrected results are reported for locomotor activity and the rotarod test because a significant Mauchly’s test result indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated. Bonferroni-corrected <italic>post-hoc</italic> tests were used to probe significant effects where appropriate.

Taken together, these findings provide further evidence that <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency, early in development, may have a more generic effect on biological mechanisms, rather than specifically targeting pathways known to be implicated in schizophrenia.</p><p id="P34">Our data demonstrate that foetal growth was unaffected by <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency through gestation, with the expected weight increases up to birth. However, there were some interesting differences in placental weight with, on average, smaller placentae in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos across all time points evaluated, which led to increased embryo:placenta ratios (EPR) in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos relative to WT. These differences were most notable at E11.5, where male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> placentae were ~32% smaller than WT and at E18.5 where female <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> placentae were ~16% smaller than both male and female WT placentae. Smaller sizes may reflect impairment in function, and with the placenta acting as the vital conduit for nutrition, this could imply a paucity of essential substances, such as neurotransmitters and amino acids, at key developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. This may be further impacted by the fact that foetal size remains unaltered, which could suggest an imbalance between foetal demands and the ability of the placentae to match this need, which could inhibit developmental progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. For example, using a mouse model of <italic>Igf2</italic> dysfunction, where only placental expression was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], we demonstrated that a foetus:placenta imbalance can lead to adult-related changes in anxiety-related behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. In this model, placental size is reduced (~25% E12 to E19) but the foetus only begins to show intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) late on at E19 leading to a low birth weight (31% of WT, a period of catch-up growth to match adult weight by P100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Other models show similar patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Thus, a mismatch between foetal demands and placental function can lead to IUGR, low birth weight, a period of exaggerated early (catch-up) growth and adult-related changes in behaviour. We observed similar patterns of pre-natal and post-natal growth indices in our model of <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency, although we did not measure birth and early post-natal weights, but male mice demonstrated a period of catch-up growth adult. We also observed more complex effects suggesting a sex-related change in placental function, which could affect later behaviour in a sex-related manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. IUGR, as an indicator of placental dysfunction has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, with the association of conceptus sex also influencing placental (dys)functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P35">In terms of effects on adult behaviour, we demonstrated comparable patterns on acoustic startle responding (ASR) and the gating of this response by a prepulse stimulus (prepulse inhibition, PPI), to previous studies in <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Deficits in attention and gating, or filtering out intrusive stimuli, are prominent features shared by both psychiatric and developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], with which haploinsufficiency of <italic>SETD1A</italic> is associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], therefore the consistent effect from our and other’s work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] in <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency mice of disrupted PPI may be expected. Altered ASR in male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice only was also found by Chen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. No effects on ASR were found in the Naga et al study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], but the sex of the mice is not clear from the methods, and results are not split by sex. We replicated our initial finding in a separate cohort of male and female mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods Figure 2</xref>) thus, it is possible to infer a sex-dependent effect on increased ASR and a sex-independent effect on PPI. In terms of startle responding, the elevated response we observe in male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice may reflect initial sensitisation to a fearful stimulus, and reduced habituation to the startle stimuli through the test session. Increased startle responding may be related to an altered fear response and/or altered emotional processing via involvement of the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] and may reflect hypervigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] which could link to the subtle anxiogenic effects we observed. There is some evidence for an interaction between sex and early life adversity, as demonstrated by the <italic>Igf2</italic>-P0 IUGR model previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], and with male rats demonstrating increased ASR following maternal separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] that could also be relevant to the developmental changes we have observed. Increased startle responding has been observed in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and Fragile X syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], in addition to PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. These conditions commonly present more in males than females, so this phenotype might be expected, however, studies have more commonly observed increased startle responding in female subjects compared to males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>].</p><p id="P36">Furthermore, we also demonstrated sex-dependent sensitivity to the typical anti-psychotic drug risperidone, with male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice showing a blunted effect to the drug on the ASR, whereas the drug reduced ASR in a dose-dependent way in WTs and female <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. However, there is little evidence for sex-related effects of acute risperidone administration, but chronic dosing appears to show a female bias, with female rats appearing to be more sensitive to chronic dosing at a young age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] and female schizophrenia patients responded better to chronic risperidone treatment than male patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. The mode of action of risperidone, with high activity via serotonergic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] suggests an interesting target to investigate in the future, especially in male <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Haloperidol, also a typical anti-psychotic drug, though mainly dopaminergic in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] had no effects on the ASR in male (or female) <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Sensorimotor gating deficits (PPI) could not be rescued by haloperidol or risperidone, although both anti-psychotics have previously been shown to reverse PPI deficits in several rodent models of schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. This suggests that both these anti-psychotic agents are ineffective for ameliorating schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, of both sexes, and point to deficits in neural systems other than the monoamine system which may be consistent with variable responses to antipsychotic treatment in individuals with <italic>SETD1A</italic> variant-associated schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Of particular relevance here, is the similarity of the disrupted PPI shown by <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> LoF models and the effects of NMDAR antagonists, such as PCP, MK-801 and ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>], which taken together with the possibility that glutamate release is likely reduced when <italic>Setd1a</italic> is knocked down in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], suggests that the glutamatergic system may be compromised as a result of Setd1a haploinsufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P37">In terms of measures of anxiety, then our data from the open field (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) assays are the first to demonstrate that <italic>Setd1a</italic> LoF can lead to a subtle anxiogenic phenotype. Exploration patterns in these tests demonstrated that both male and female <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice showed avoidance of the more anxiety-inducing regions of each piece of apparatus, the central zone of the OFT and the open arms of the EPM. Previous studies using the OFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] have used a procedure more akin to our locomotor activity assessment, with repeated long sessions and found, as we have, that basic motoric behaviour and investigation is not affected. Within session measures of activity from the OFT and EPM also confirm this. It would be interesting if in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] the first few minutes of the first sessions could be re-examined to gauge if any anxiety phenotype was present. Taken together, these data illustrate subtle effects of <italic>Setd1a</italic> LoF on anxiety, which is consistent with emotional issues as co-morbid presentations in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. The other adult behaviour we investigated recapitulated previous findings in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> haploinsufficient mice, with no significant effects on novel object discrimination and recall (NOR), and no profound motoric impairments in either male or female mice. NOR performance was equivalent to Mukai et a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] with no differential recall with a short or long retention delay. However, in the Nagahama et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] study there was an impairment at the short delay, but not the longer timepoint possibly indicating a subtle phenotype that is subsumed by the difference between their model, and the ones used here and by Mukai et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] which may reflect the different targeting strategies, and loci, for disrupting <italic>Setd1a</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P38">Taken together these data demonstrate that this new <italic>Setd1a</italic> LoF mouse model recapitulates some of the core findings of previous models, of relevance to neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia in a large experimental cohort of both sexes. We also provide some insight into <italic>Setd1a</italic> haploinsufficiency on development and how it might interact with sex. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia highlights the pre-and peri-natal phase of life as key period in the onset of the disorder, with intrauterine compromise an important factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Sex differences in schizophrenia are well documented, in terms of incidence and symptom presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>], thus the altered developmental indices in <italic>Setd1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> conceptuses and behavioural differences we found add a further dimension to this theory. Taken together our findings would suggest pre-natal effects of <italic>Setd1a</italic> LoF on adult behaviour, mediated by impaired placental functionality and metabolic function in developing neurones. Use of a conditional KO model, where setd1a LoF can be “switched off” either during development or in adulthood would be one way to unpick this conundrum. However, either way, these data add to the growing understanding of the role of <italic>Setd1a</italic> in brain development and behaviour. Our findings, coupled with those from others investigating different <italic>Setd1a</italic> models, demonstrate replicable common phenotypes of relevance that could be used for the development and testing of therapies in rescue studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemntary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS193886-supplement-Supplemntary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d90aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The MRC Mary Lyon Centre (Harwell, Oxfordshire, UK) generated the C57BL/6NTac-Setd1atm1c(EUCOMM)Wtsi/WtsiCnrm mouse strain from which we derived the strain used in this study.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Integrative Neuroscience PhD grant (109084/Z/15/Z) and an A.
