We investigate how human pTau affects cells and network activity in the hippocampal formation of THY-Tau22 tauopathy model mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. We find that pTau preferentially accumulates in deep-layer pyramidal neurons, leading to neurodegeneration, and we establish that pTau spreads to oligodendrocytes. During goal-directed virtual navigation in aged transgenic mice, we detect fewer high-firing prosubicular pyramidal cells but the firing population retains its coupling to theta oscillations. Analysis of network oscillations and firing patterns of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons recorded in head-fixed and freely-moving mice suggests preserved neuronal coordination. In spatial memory tests, transgenic mice have reduced short-term familiarity but spatial working and reference memory are surprisingly normal.

Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Niemann-Pick disease type C and some types of familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (FTDP) have a mixture of 3R and 4R Tau. Those with only 3R Tau include Pick’s disease and some types of FTDP. The 4R tauopathies include corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), argyrophilic grain disease, and other types of FTDP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> The impact on cognitive and motor functions depend on which brain regions and cell types are most vulnerable to developing pTau aggregates and the extent of neurodegeneration. Deficits in spatial memory – our ability to encode and recall environmental contexts - are strongly associated with cortical pTau-related progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> It is generally accepted that the spread of pTau correlates with severity of neurological symptoms, with age being the greatest risk factor.</p><p id="P5">Animal models provide a wealth of information about the impact of pTau on various aspects of behavior, cognition, network excitability, and plasticity. Tauopathy models can suffer from progressive motor impairments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> making it difficult to perform investigations using physiologically-relevant aged animals. We therefore investigated how aggregation of mutant human 4R Tau affected spatial memory and neuronal coordination in awake behaving mice at different ages using the well-characterized THY-Tau22 mouse line. This line gradually develops pTau inclusions from 2-3 months of age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and has a less severe phenotype than related lines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> ideal for investigating cumulative effects of pTau in aged mice. Importantly, heterozygous transgenic (tg) mice and their non-transgenic (ntg) littermates do not develop significant motor impairments during ageing, enabling behavioral testing and awake <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings. Tg mice display prominent neurofibrillary tangles (accumulation of human pTau in somata) as well as neuropil threads (pTau in other processes such as axons). We found that ageing tg mice - which had normal life expectancy - had hippocampal neurodegeneration, showed a reduction in high firing pyramidal neurons, and exhibited reduced short-term familiarity for spatial cues, with pTau spreading from neurons to oligodendrocytes. Despite these changes, neuronal coupling to theta oscillations, and spatial working and reference memory performance showed no detectable differences. We hypothesize that this is due to unimpaired network mechanisms that govern cortical neuronal coordination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Distribution of pTau in ageing mice</title><p id="P6">To understand how pTau aggregation affects neuronal and network activity, we first mapped pTau in brains of tg mice at different ages. By 2-3 months old (mo), clusters of AT8 immunoreactive (pTau+) neurons were observed in dorsal prosubiculum (ProS), a region between hippocampal dorsal CA1 (CA1d) and dorsal subiculum (SUBd) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The distal part of CA1d (closest to ProS) and SUBd contained very few pTau+ pyramidal neurons at this age. The intensity of pTau in ProS peaked after 8 mo, with large numbers of pTau+ somata and processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), corresponding to the time when hippocampal-dependent memory deficits have first been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Accordingly, a greater number of pTau+ neurons in CA1d were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), spreading towards CA2 and a corresponding increase in SUBd. Intensity of pTau decreased in aged mice (&gt;16mo), likely due to cell loss <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and a lack of pTau+ somata in ProS and SUBd of mice &gt;21 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Based on the combination of changes in ProS and CA1, we define young mice as &lt;8 mo, ageing mice as 8-16 mo, and aged mice as &gt;16 mo.</p><p id="P7">In young mice, pTau+ dentate granule cells were rare at the septal pole (sparse pTau: n=4/5 mice; moderate pTau: n=1/5 mice) but common at the temporal pole (moderate or extensive: n=3/6 mice; absent or sparse: n=3/6 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a-c</xref>). Mossy fibers showed variable levels of pTau, likely originating from granule cells of the temporal pole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a,c</xref>). In ageing mice, the septal pole contained mostly moderate pTau (n=2/3 mice; sparse: n=1/3 mice) and the temporal pole more extensive pTau (n=2/3 mice; moderate: n=1/3 mice). In aged mice, the septal pole was variable (moderate or extensive: n=5/10 mice; sparse: n=5/10 mice) whereas the temporal pole showed extensive pTau (n=6/7 mice; sparse: n=1/6 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a-c</xref>). Temporal (ventral) CA1 and CA3 also showed gradual increases in pTau levels during ageing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The most prominent and earliest site outside the hippocampal formation was the basolateral amygdala, exhibiting moderate pTau at 2.5 mo and extensive pTau in all animals &gt;4.5 mo (n=14 mice; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1a, S2a-c</xref>). The medial prefrontal cortex showed modest pTau (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). The entorhinal cortex had similar modest levels of pTau at all ages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d</xref>). In isocortical areas, pTau was distributed primarily around layer 5, remaining sparse until much later in life (sparse in n=10/10 young and ageing mice; moderate or extensive in n=7/9 aged mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a-c, S2b</xref>). In ntg littermates, pTau was not observed (n=16/16 mice, 2-24 mo). Lipofuscin fluorescence was detected in all aged mice. In summary, the distribution in the hippocampal formation, isocortex and amygdala largely confirmed previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">In contrast to the neuronal pTau distribution described above, key subcortical areas linked to the generation of theta frequency rhythmic activity were unaffected, including anterior and midline thalamus, medial septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2b,c</xref>), mammillary bodies, and supramammillary nucleus.

Midbrain dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive) neurons lacked pTau.

The loss of higher firing neurons in ProS/SUBd, due to high pTau levels, suggests sequences of neurons encoding different features of the environment may be disrupted. A reduction in short-term familiarity could also explain why tg mice spent significantly longer in the start arm of the T-maze before initiating runs: placement in the start arm retained some novelty for the mouse, possibly due to the reduction in ProS/SUBd activity. Lastly, we found that both young and ageing tg mice naïve to the elevated plus maze spent longer in the open arms. The ventral hippocampus and inter-connected amygdala also develop early Tau pathology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> which we observed throughout the lifetime of the tg mice.

Alzheimer’s disease, FTDP, PSP and other tauopathies show Tau pathology in several subcortical areas such as the thalamus and brainstem, which could promote memory deficits. Overall, the results of our detailed characterization of the THY-Tau22 mouse line demonstrate that in spite of widespread hippocampal Tau pathology, uptake of pTau by oligodendrocytes, neurodegeneration, and loss of high firing ProS/SUBd cells, many measured functional parameters and behaviors remain remarkably similar to age-matched control animals, likely due to the operations of unaffected neuronal systems.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P40">Since we recorded mostly in CA1d and ProS/SUBd, we cannot rule out changes in network oscillations and neuronal activity in other pTau-rich regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> We recorded place cells in head-fixed mice running along a virtual linear track.

Ocular lubricant was applied to the eyes, and Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Aspen) was injected into the scalp. Under aseptic conditions, an incision was made along the scalp to expose the skull. Two M1 screws (Precision Technology Supplies) were fixed into the skull above the cerebellum, with one or both used as electrical reference. Another screw was fixed ~1.50 mm anterior of the bregma. After scoring the skull and applying a thin layer of cyanoacrylate super glue, a machined glass-reinforced plastic D-shaped head plate (custom made at the Department of Physics, Oxford University) was positioned over the screws and Refobacin bone cement (Zimmer Biomet) was used to secure the head plate and screws to the skull.

Units were classified as complex spike (CS) cells if they showed a prominent peak between 3-8 ms in their spike time autocorrelograms followed by a relatively fast decay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> Units were compared to a separate dataset from,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> who defined putative pyramidal cells (PCs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) as units with “an overall firing rate &lt; 3 Hz, a spike width at 90% of the peak amplitude above 0.5 ms, and an event autocorrelogram value below 10 ms”. For firing rate analysis, one session each was excluded for animals TV149 and TO125 due to probes being located in the isocortex, just dorsal of the hippocampus (6 units in total), and one session was excluded for animal TV179 due to a lack of isolated units.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Place cell classification</title><p id="P56">Significant peak firing rates along the virtual corridor were computed by a permutation test as described by Ozdemir et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> Each unit’s firing rate was calculated across 18 spatio-temporal bins.

Mostly positive deflections in the LFP during non-running periods and typically high power theta oscillations during running indicated a likely stratum pyramidale or stratum oriens location. After detecting theta epochs as for glass electrode recordings above, theta phase was calculated by linear interpolation between troughs of the band-pass-filtered (5-12 Hz) theta oscillations, with 0° and 360° set as the troughs. The Rayleigh test was used to test for uniformity of circular phase distributions; the mean phase and mean vector length (r) were used as measures of the preferred phase and coupling strength, respectively (using custom scripts written in Mathematica). For ntg mice, we sampled 968-1,745 s duration theta periods (72,523 theta cycles) and excluded CS units and non-CS units that had fewer than 72 and 241 spikes, respectively. For tg mice, we sampled 291-3,023 s duration theta periods (91,233 theta cycles) and excluded CS cells and non-CS cells with fewer than 45 and 168 spikes, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><sec id="S36"><title>Spatial novelty preference Y-maze task</title><p id="P58">This task was designed to assess short-term spatial memory with the expectation that normal mice prefer novel over familiar spatial environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> A solid black plastic Y-maze (30 cm arms, 7 cm wide, 20 cm high walls) was positioned 17 cm from the floor.

One arm was designated as the ‘novel arm’, another the ‘start arm’, and the third as the ‘other arm’. The novel arm was blocked off and the mouse was placed in the start arm and was able to freely explore the start and other arms (exposure phase). After 5 minutes, the block was removed and mice could explore all 3 arms (test phase). Each mouse was only tested once, and arm assignment was counterbalanced for genotype and cohort.

A hidden inverted glass beaker (~6 cm diameter) was kept submerged at the end of one of the arms (‘goal arm’). Extra-maze cues were kept constant. At the start of each trial, the mouse was placed in one of the other two arms (‘start arms’). The start arm was allocated pseudorandomly across trials for each mouse with no more than 2 consecutive starts from the same arm and equal numbers of starts from the arm to the left and right of the target arm in each block of trials). The goal arm remained the same for each animal, but the allocation of the goal arm was counterbalanced for genotype and cohort. The mouse was allowed to swim freely until it reached the hidden platform. However, if it did not reach the platform by 90 s it was guided by the experimenter. The mouse was allowed to remain on the platform for 30 s before being removed. There were 5 trials/d for 10 days (acquisition training) with an inter-trial interval of 15 s. For each trial, the first arm entered (choice) was scored 1 for the goal arm and 0 for the other arm or re-entered the start arm. A block was defined as 5 trials, with performance expressed as percentage of correct first choices (choice accuracy). On day 11, a probe trial was performed, whereby the platform was removed and the mouse was allowed to swim freely for 60 s.

Walls were 10 cm high, and the maze was raised 44 cm off the floor. Group-housed mice were maintained on a restricted feeding schedule to ~90 % of their free-feeding weight and fed every day at 16:00. On the 6<sup>th</sup> day after starting food restriction, mice were habituated to 50% sweetened condensed milk in a dish in their home cage in the holding room. The next day, milk was provided in their cages inside the behavior-testing room (context 1). The following day, cagemates were group habituated to the T-maze with 0.5 ml milk rewards in plastic dishes at the ends of both goal arms. The room was well-lit and contained extra-maze cues. An odorless cleaning solution was used to clean the maze before testing different cages. After several more days on food restriction, non-matching to place testing began. Each trial consisted of a ‘forced run’ and a ‘choice run’, with 4 trials per day defined as a session. In the forced run, one goal arm was blocked with a wooden block. Mice were placed into a blocked-off start box at the far end of the start arm. After this start block was removed, mice had to run to the unblocked goal arm for a 0.1 ml reward. The blocked goal arm was determined by a pseudorandom sequence (with equal numbers of left and right turns per session, with no more than 2 consecutive turns in the same direction). If the mouse did not initiate a run within 60 s after removing the start black, the mouse would be re-tested after all the other cagemates were tested in that session. For all trials, the delay time in task initiation was measured from start block removal until leaving the start box area. After sampling the reward on the forced run, the mouse was removed from the maze. The mouse was placed back at the far end of the start arm and now had to choose between the goal arms (now with both arms unblocked). The average time between sampling the reward on the forced run to being free to initiate the choice run from the far end of the start arm was 16 s (from n=3,240 trials). The mouse was rewarded for choosing the unvisited (previously blocked) arm, i.e. for alternating. An alternation score was calculated by scoring 1 for alternating and 0 for not alternating. Mice were tested one trial at a time, so that all cagemates were tested once before starting their second trial (~4-8 min inter-trial interval, depending on cage size). A total of 10 sessions were undertaken for each mouse (40 trials total), and analyzed as blocks of 4 trials. The same mice were tested at 3 different ages, with the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> tests no requiring habituation. Since ntg and tg mice reached high levels of performance (see Results), differences between genotypes might be revealed by using an unfamiliar context. In context 2, a different testing room was used featuring different extra-maze cues, an R-Carvone odor, and prominent intra-maze cues (white stripes on the maze floor and a red cross on the block), and cleaning was carried out with ethanol instead of the odorless cleaning solution.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p id="P61">To test anxiety-related behavior, mice familiar to other behavioral tasks were placed individually in the center of an elevated plus maze facing an open arm.
