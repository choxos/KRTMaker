Previously, a histone H3-H4 dimer has been isolated bound to Importin-4 (Imp4) and and the chaperone ASF1, suggesting H3 and H4 fold together in the cytoplasm before nuclear import. However, other studies have shown the existence of monomeric H3 in the nucleus, indicating a post import folding pathway. Here we report that the predominant importin associated with cytoplasmic H3 is Importin-5 (Imp5), which hands-off its monomeric cargo to nuclear sNASP. Imp5, in contrast to Imp4, binds to both H3 and H4 containing constitutively monomeric mutations and binds to newly synthesised, monomeric H3 tethered in the cytoplasm. Constitutively monomeric H3 retains its interaction with NASP, whereas monomeric H4 retains interactions specifically with HAT1 and RBBP7. High-resolution separation of NASP interactors shows the ’s’ isoform but not the ’t’ isoform associates with monomeric H3, whilst both isoforms associate with H3-H4 dimers in at least three discrete multi-chaperoning complexes. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding experiments show mutual exclusivity between sNASP and Imp5 in binding H3, suggesting direct competition for interaction sites, with the GTP-bound form of Ran required for histone transfer. Finally, using pulse-chase analysis we show that cytoplasm-tethered histones do not interact with endogenous NASP until they reach the nucleus, whereupon they bind rapidly. We propose an Imp5-specific import pathway for monomeric H3 that hands off to sNASP in the nucleus, with a parallel H4 pathway involving Imp5 and the HAT1-RBBP7 complex, followed by nuclear folding and hand-off to deposition factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Histone H3,H4</kwd><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd><kwd>importins</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Histones are one of the most abundance class of proteins within the cell, with nuclear import and deposition into chromatin being a major challenge during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Import, folding, and delivery of histones to sites of incorporation in a timely manner can thus impact a broad range of genomic processes and are of great current interest (1, 3–6).</p><p id="P3">Histones are synthesised in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus associated with importin proteins (also known as karyopherins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Once in the nucleus, importins interact with RanGTP leading to the unloading of their cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Work on different organisms has cemented the notion that, despite certain redundancy, most importin-histone interactions are specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). For instance, H2A and H2B have been shown to associate with Importin-9 (Imp9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), whereas, H3 and H4 have been shown to associate with Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, Imp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Similar selectivity occurs in yeast, with H3 and H4 shown to interact with homologs Kap123 and Kap121, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> H3-H4 have broader binding profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and can be imported by a number of importins in reconstituted systems using isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Histone chaperones also associate promptly with newly synthesised histones, providing an environment for solubility and ensuring correct folding before targeting towards sites of DNA deposition (1, 2, 6). Numerous factors have been isolated in complex with H3 and H4 from cytosolic extracts (15, 16, 19, 20); however, as many of these factors are overwhelmingly found in the nucleus under native conditions, it is not clear how well cytosolic extracts represent the true cytoplasm of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Nuclear Autoantigenic Sperm Protein was first identified as an H1-binding protein expressed in testis (tNASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) that also interacted with HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In dividing somatic cells a shorter splice isoform is prevalent (sNASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), whereas both isoforms often occur in transformed cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Subsequently, NASP has been shown to interact predominantly with H3 and H4 (15, 16, 19, 27). NASP displays multiva-lent interactions with its histone cargo, binding to a peptide epitope at the C-terminus of H3 via a canonical TPR-peptide interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), and to an N-terminal region of H3 via a site on the surface of the TPR domain (27, 29, 30). The latter interaction is structurally compatible with H3-H4 dimer binding in conjunction with ASF1. However, the TPR-H3 C-terminal peptide interaction is structurally exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These structural analyses may partly explain why NASP binds a supra-stoichiometric amount of H3 over H4; that is NASP binds to both an H3 monomeric and an H3-H4 dimeric pool of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Despite significant investigation, it is still not clear where, and in association with what factors, folding of newly synthesised H3-H4 occurs in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Isolation of an H3-H4 dimer bound to Imp4 and ASF1 in cytosolic extracts has been accepted as evidence for H3 and H4 folding in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, it has been shown that such extracts often contain soluble nucleoplasmic components, due to the difficulty in rupturing the plasma membrane whilst leaving the nuclear membrane intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and thus how these extracts relate to the cytoplasm is not clear. H3 and H4 tethered in the cytoplasm immediately after translation remain monomeric and do not fold with their endogenous counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), whilst supra-stoichiometric binding of H3 by NASP suggests the presence of a stable monomeric pool of H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Furthermore, monomeric histones serve as effective substrates for nuclear import in isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), suggesting a monomeric substrate can be recognised by importins, at least in permeabilised cells.</p><p id="P7">In this study we investigate the interactome of histones H3 &amp; H4 using constitutive monomeric mutants and post-synthesis trapping using the RAPID-release approach. We identify Imp5 as a primary binder of monomeric H3 and H4 in the cytoplasm, with histone-specific interactions maintained by a number of histone chaperones. Fractionation of fractionate NASP-associated complexes, revealed a stable NASPH3 monomer population, roughly equal in size to that of NASP-H3-H4 containing complexes. NASP and Imp5 binding are mutually exclusive, with <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showing RanGTP is necessary for hand-off to occur. Lastly, we show that NASP associates with H3 rapidly after its import, suggesting it is a receptor for monomeric H3 after transfer from Imp5. These findings support a model in which newly synthesised H3 and H4 are imported as monomers bound to Imp5 and fold in the nucleus once associated with their his-tone chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Constitutively monomeric H3 &amp; H4 translocate to the nucleus and retain bind to a subset of histone chaperones &amp; importins</title><p id="P8">To probe factors that interact with monomeric histones, we designed mutations that preclude folding of the heterodimer, trapping histones in their otherwise transient, post-synthesis state. As any mutation may omit potential binders, two divergent strategies were taken: 1 - breaking the α2 helix of the histone fold domain by insertion of three glycine residues (helix-breaker mutations, HB), and 2 - disruption of the hi-stone fold by substituting three hydrophobic core residues (fold-disruptor mutations, FD), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To test their cellular localisation, histone mutants were fused to eGFP and transiently expressed in HEK293-F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Both sets of mutants showed nuclear fluorescence in interphase cells, demonstrating they are import-competent, but did not colocalise to mitotic chromosomes, suggesting they are not incorporated into chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We further tested chromatin incorporation using Fluorescence Recovery After Photo-bleaching (FRAP) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Chromatinised histones should turnover very slowly, whilst soluble histones should recover almost immediately. Indeed, we found while recovery of WT histones in the bleached region was slow, recovery of mutant histones occurred within seconds. We therefore conclude that non-dimerising mutants of H3 and H4 are imported into the nucleus, but are not incorporated into chromatin.</p><p id="P10">To test if the mutants can fold with their endogenous counterpart, we purified C-terminal eGFP fusions using single step, GFP-Trap<sup>®</sup> pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). As endogenous his-tones are unusually small, they are well-resolved from other interacting proteins and can be unambiguously identified by coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE. Whilst WT H3.1-eGFP pulled down H4, and H4-eGFP pulled down H3, mutant histones failed to pull down any of their endogenous counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further investigate the associations of mutant histones we performed western blots, probing the pulldowns with antibodies for a number of known interacting factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Whilst WT H3 interacted with the full cohort of probed hi-stone chaperones, H3 mutants only interacted with NASP (both s and t isoforms) and Imp5, but surprisingly not Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). H4 similarly lost the majority of its interacting proteins, retaining only the HAT1 complex (HAT1 &amp; RBBP7) and Imp5, but not Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that constitutively monomeric mutants are imported into the nucleus, show differences in their chaperone profiles, but share the common binding of Imp5 over Imp4.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interactomes of histone monomer mutants</title><p id="P12">To unbiasedly identify factors interacting with monomeric H3 and H4 we performed affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). Plotting normalised total precursor intensity of WT against mutant, we confirmed Imp5 and NASP retains interaction with monomeric H3, and Imp5 and HAT1-RBBP7 retains interaction with monomeric H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). Notably, binding profiles are similar across both types of mutant (HD or FB) and reproducible across three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In addition, we identified a number of HSP70 family members associating with both monomeric &amp; WT H3 (HSPA1B, HSPA6, HSPA8) and H4 (HSPA1B, HSPA8), confirming previously identified interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and highlighting the cross-talk between heat shock chaperones and the histone chaperoning network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The HSP70-interacting protein DNAJC9 showed a strong preference for WT histones in both H3 and H4 pulldowns, as would be expected from its recently solved structure with an H3-H4 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Similarly, factors involved in the direct deposition of histones onto DNA (CAF1 complex, DAXX, ASF1A-B, MCM2) demonstrated strong preference for WT histones, again, as one might expect from their structural characterisation with H3-H4 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Intriguingly, two recently discovered histone chaperones UBR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and C1QBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) retained interactions with monomeric histones, with UBR7 showing specificity for his-tone H3 while C1QBP interacted with both H3 and H4. Furthermore, NAP1-like proteins NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 also bound to monomeric histones, albeit at much lower levels than other chaperones. Taken together, these results show that monomeric mutants of H3 and H4 retain distinct interaction profiles compared to WT, and confirms Imp5, but not Imp4, as interacting with histones in their monomeric state.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NASP forms discrete H3 monomer and H3-H4 dimer containing complexes</title><p id="P15">NASP can chaperone a monomer of H3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), bind to an epitope obscured in the H3-H4 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), and pulldown supra-stoichiometric amounts of H3 over H4 when isolated from HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To probe the NASP-associated histone pool at endogenous levels, we tagged NASP at its endogenous locus with TEV-cleavable (TEVcs) eGFP using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). For comparison of H3-H4 dimer binding, we also knocked in a SpotTag-mCherry-3Ccs tag in frame with the first exon of ASF1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), and purified these constructs using a single step GFP-/RFP-Trap<sup>®</sup> pulldown, alongside sNASP expressed transiently in HEK293-F cells. sNASP over-expression in HEK293-F cells and NASP expression from its endogenous locus in HeLa showed at least a 2-fold molar excess of H3 over H4, whereas ASF1 showed close to equimolar amounts in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B &amp; C</xref>), demonstrating that under endogenous conditions NASP binds to a suprachoichiometric amount of H3 over H4.</p><p id="P16">To determine if this excess of H3 relates to a sub-pool of NASP-H3 monomer, we performed biochemical fractionation of sNASP-containing complexes from HEK293-F cells (insufficient material prevented us using endogenously tagged HeLa lines, however, the similar ratios of H3 to H4 in both lines suggests transient expression in HEK293 is representative of the endogenous scenario). Associated complexes were affinity captured using GFP-Trap<sup>®</sup> resin before separation on either a glycerol gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) or by native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of gradient fractions revealed a sNASP-H3 monomer complex that could be unambiguously separated from other H3-H4 containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, fractions 6-8, arrows). Western blotting confirmed the presence of sNASP and H3 in this complex, and the absence of H4, in addition to the absence co-chaperones HAT1, RBBP7, ASF1A and ASF1B, all of which eluted with the H3-H4 dimer displaying the H4K5Ac mark of newly synthesised histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Interestingly, UBR7 came down with sNASP, but did not migrate with the main sNASP-H3 species, as may be expect from our monomeric histone mutant analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), but overlapped with the broad sNASP co-chaperone peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Native PAGE resulted in greater separation compared to glycerol gradient centrifugation, with individual bands representing distinct complexes being observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). To identify components of each band, further separation in a second dimension under denaturing conditions was performed before staining with Coomassie or probing by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Free sNASP is clearly visible as the major species in band 3, with partially degraded versions as minor species in band 1 and 2. sNASP-bound H3, without H4, migrated as a separate species in band 5 (arrow), whereas H3-H4 and co-chaperones eluted in various species from bands 6-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Curiously, a minor, higher molecular weight band was detected in the anti-NASP western blot under a long exposure, which runs at a size indicative of the tNASP isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). This was intriguing as only the shorter sNASP iso-form was expressed as the eGFP-fusion and may relate to a low level of dimerisation with the endogeous protein, which has been suggested from the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Interestingly, only the s, and not the t, isoform co-migrated with the H3 monomer band. To investigate this further we used a HEK293-F CRISPR knock-in cell line to separate complexes from both isoforms under endogenous expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). As expected the CRIPSR knock-in showed similar amounts of both splice iso-forms, and again only the sNASP isoform co-migrated with an H3 monomer species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, arrow), suggesting that monomer binding may be an sNASP-specific function.</p><p id="P19">To more accurately assign components to each species, bands from sNASP 1D native gels were excised and subjected to mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Label-free quantification (LFQ) of total precursor intensity for top hits (full list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4</xref>) were plotted for each band in sequence, with the corresponding profiles revealing distinct sub-complexes associated with sNASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G and H</xref>). Band 5 was validated as containing monomeric H3 bound to sNASP without H4 and, surprisingly, UBR7. The UBR7 containing complex was estimated as roughly one tenth of the NASP-H3 signal, which may explain the elution of UBR7 in the glycerol gradient: that is, the minor NASP-H3-UBR7 complex elutes separately from the major NASP-H3 complex on a glycerol gradient, but similarly in native PAGE. Band 7 contained peak signals for the HSC70 protein HSPA5, in addition to the histone chaperones RBBP7 and ASF1A-B and both H3 and H4, whereas band 8 contained peak signals for HSPA1A and HSPA8 together with a smaller proportion of H3 and H4. The NASP complex in band 9 contained the cochaperones HAT1, RBBP7 and ASF1A-B along with H3 and H4. DNAJC9 was not detected, suggesting it does not form a complex with sNASP.</p><p id="P20">In summary, NASP forms distinct complexes containing either an H3 monomer or H3-H4 dimers, with monomeric H3 associating specifically with the s isoform. A sub-population of the NASP-H3 monomer pool is bound to the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR7, previously shown to associate with H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and NASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), whilst H3-H4 dimer-bound forms split into at least three complexes that differentially contain co-chaperones HAT1, RBBP7, ASF1A-B and/or the HSC70 family proteins HSPA1A, HSPA5 and HSPA8. Strikingly, we did not detect Imp5 in NASP-bound complexes despite it co-purifying with monomeric H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>), suggesting that NASP and Imp5 form mutually exclusive complexes with histones.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Imp5 and sNASP are mutually exclusive in binding H3 and require RanGTP for hand-off</title><p id="P21">We next investigated the interplay between Imp5 and sNASP binding. To prevent extraneous factors affecting our analysis, we used purified recombinant proteins reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic>. Imp5 was able to bind equimolar concentrations of H3 and H4 when separated by size exclusion chromatography, demonstrating a direct interaction with histones, and interacted with both monomeric histones and H3-H4 dimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>), as expected from its association with both WT and monomeric mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P22">As sNASP and Imp5 elution overlapped in size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4B</xref>), we used glycerol gradient ultra-centrifugation to separate the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A &amp; B</xref>). Purified Imp5-H3 complex was combined with an equimolar amount of sNASP and left to equilibrate for three hours on ice before separation. Interestingly, Imp5-H3 and sNASP eluted in separate fractions, suggesting direct competition for binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the reverse experiment where Imp5 was added to the NASP-H3 complex and equilibrated for 3 hours on ice, Imp5 was able to strip sNASP of its histone, with almost all H3 co-fractionating with Imp5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4D</xref>). This suggests that, firstly, as pre-assembled complex was used as input, NASP-H3 has a dissociation rate significantly below the incubation time for competition (three hours), secondly, Imp5 has a significantly higher dissociation constant than NASP towards monomeric H3, and thirdly, the dissociation of Imp5-H3 <italic>in vivo</italic> likely requires additional factors, such as release by RanGTP, rather than being mediated by direct competition.</p><p id="P23">To investigate this further, we purified bacterially expressed Ran and added it at equimolar concentrations to sNASP and Imp5-H3, allowing it to equilibrate for three hours on ice. In its purified state, which most likely represents the GDP-bound form, Ran was unable to bind to Imp5 and displace H3. To favour the GTP-bound state, Ran was incubated with 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM GTP for 20 minutes on ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), before performing the same competition experiment as above. Interestingly, RanGTP was bound to Imp5, displacing the majority of its H3 cargo, which was transferred to sNASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In summary, direct binding competition towards H3 likely represents the absence of complex formation between Imp5 and NASP that we see <italic>in vivo</italic>, with histone transfer mediated by the canonical RanGTP pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Imp5 is the primary importin associated with H3 in the cytoplasm, whereas NASP binds only after nuclear import</title><p id="P25">Both Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and Imp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) have been shown to interact with H3-H4 in cytosolic extracts, with Imp4 being widely regarded as the primary import factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). As cytoplasmic extracts often contain soluble nucleoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), we wanted to test interactions between H3, Imp4 and Imp5 <italic>in situ</italic> in living cells.</p><p id="P26">To do this we first employed mito-F2H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) to probe their association using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Mito-F2H builds on the principle of the F2H (Fluorescence 2-Hybrid) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), but uses the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) as a cytoplasmic tether rather than an integrated LacO array in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Using this technique, we previously demonstrated that tethered H3-eGFP was monomeric and associated with mCherry-Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To probe the interaction with Imp5, we co-expressed tethered eGFP with mCherry-Imp5 and quantified the colocalisation using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R). As expected, mCherry-Imp5 interacted strongly with tethered H3 at a level comparable to Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>), suggesting under conditions of over expression both importins can interact with cytoplasmic H3.</p><p id="P27">One drawback of mito-F2H is the static snapshot it gives of factors in the cytoplasm, whereas probing interactions dynamically as histones translocate to the nucleus would be more informative. To address this we used a previously developed pulse-chase method called ’RAPID-release’ (Rapamycin Activated Protease through Induced Dimerisation and <italic>release</italic> of tethered cargo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). RAPID-release consists of two components: the histone cargo with a cytoplasmic tether localising to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and a protease that can be locally activated through rapamycin-induced recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The system is highly adaptable and can be modified to study both localisation and interactions using appropriate functional tags such as fluorescent proteins and/or proximity ligation tags, such as APEX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Firstly, to test the dynamic nature of Imp5’s association with tethered H3, we released H3-mCherry in the presence of co-expressed eGFP-Imp5. The colocalisation observed under static conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) disappeared when rapamycin was added to the cells, with H3 being imported rapidly and Imp5 remaining in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, top), as quantified by the reduction in Pearson’s R value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, bottom), suggesting that the Imp5-H3 interaction is cytoplasm-specific, and that hand-off to the nuclear chaperoning machinery is a rapid event.</p><p id="P29">Secondly, to address which factors associate with tethered H3 proteome-wide, we incorporated an APEX2 tag into the tethered construct in a doxycycline-inducible FRT HeLa cell line. The APEX2 peroxidase allows for time-resolved, fast proximity biotinylation, requiring the xenobiotic biotin-phenol as a substrate and the addition of hydrogen peroxide for one minute as catalyser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Preliminary analysis showed that the APEX fusion presented slower release kinetics when compared to H3-eGFP alone, possibly due to the increase in steric hindrance derived from a considerably larger fusion construct, with the majority of tethered H3 being released 60 minutes after addition of rapamycin, and all being released by 120 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). We performed proximity ligation reactions at 0 min (cytoplasmic interactions), 10 min (mixed), and 120 min (nuclear interactions) after rapamycin addition allowing a one minute labelling window. Proximity ligation reactions were carried out in triplicate, quenched, and isolation of biotinylated peptides under denaturing conditions carried out. In this way, only interactions that occurred in the cell and not during post-lysis procedures were recorded.</p><p id="P30">The 0 min and 10 min datasets were very similar, owing to cleavage of the H3-eGFP-APEX2 tag being slower than the APEX2-free version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4</xref>), restricting our analysis to 0 and 120 min, relating to cytoplasmic and nuclear interactions, respectively. To control for unspecific interactions, we filtered our results against a control comprised of tethered APEX without H3. Enrichment in the nucleus or cytoplasm was visualised in a volcano plot by plotting the LFQ ratio against a probability value derived from three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>), with the triplicate LFQ scores for specific hits plotted individually alongside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Coloring hits based on their nuclear localisation, as determined by the human protein atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), revealed annotated cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins enriched at 0 min, and annotated nuclear proteins present at 120 min, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Both Imp4 and Imp5 were detected bound to H3 in the cytoplasm, but Imp5 was ∼100-fold enriched over Imp4 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G &amp; H</xref>) demonstrating that under endogenous conditions Imp5 is the primary importin associated with cytoplasmically tethered H3. NASP was only detectable after H3 had translocated to the nucleus, as were other known histone chaperones such as RBBP7-4 and MCM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4</xref>), supporting our previous findings that NASP interacts with his-tones in the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Interestingly, we detected the HSC70 family member HSPA8, which bound to H3 comparably across the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G &amp; H</xref>), suggesting a compartment independent role for this chaperone. Histone H4, as a common contaminant, was identified at similar levels across samples including the tethered APEX control, suggesting affinity for the tag or resin, and had to be excluded from analysis. In summary, (?) methods identify Imp5 as the major H3 binding importin (?), with NASP interacting with H3 only once it has translocated to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NASP binds rapidly to newly imported H3</title><p id="P32">As the APEX2-tag suppressed the cleavage rate of tethered H3 in the RAPID-release assay we were unable to probe early events following H3 import. To address this we removed APEX and introduced the RAPID-release system into an eGFP-NASP CRIPSR cell line, swapping the H3-eGFP for H3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Endogenously expressed eGFPNASP was entirely nuclear, with no enrichment over the tethered histone, further showing they do not interact in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Release of H3-mCherry by addition of rapamycin followed similar kinetics to previously described H3-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), resulting in a half maximum cleavage at around 10 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S6</xref>). Unlike Imp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), association could not be inferred from the microscopy alone as H3-mCherry is diffuse in the nucleus after release similar to NASP. To address this, we performed co-IPs at 10 min, 1 hour and 24 hour intervals after histone release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) to capture the interaction. Interestingly, H3 association with NASP peaked at the 10 minute time point, when the nucleus experiences the highest surge of the released histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, red arrows), strongly suggesting that NASP associates with H3 as it enters the nucleus. Association with H3 was also present at later time points, with 24 hours likely to represent an equilibrium between soluble and chromatin-bound state. This suggests that NASP can also interact with post-nucleosomal hi-stone, and is not necessarily limited to the interaction with incoming, newly synthesised H3. Taken together, these findings suggest NASP is the predominant nuclear receptor for H3 monomer via a rapid hand-off event from Imp5.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Rapid nuclear import and folding of histones is crucial for timely nucleosome deposition, funtionalisation and DNA safe-keeping. Several studies have identified Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), but also Imp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), as interacting with hi-stones H3 and H4. In this study, we provide evidence that Imp5 is the primary importin bound to H3 when detected by <italic>in situ</italic> methods, and that, in contrast to Imp4, Imp5 interacts preferentially with a monomer of H3.</p><p id="P34">Due to the lack of structural information regarding Imp5’s interaction with histones, it is not immediately clear why there is a functional difference in their binding. A recent structure of Imp4 in complex with H3-H4 and ASF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) agrees with our finding that Imp4 does not interact with monomeric H3 and H4 mutants, in that, although Imp4 interacts predominantly with the N-terminal region of H3, it also makes contacts with the histone fold domain of H4. This is in contrast to Imp9’s interaction with its H2A-H2B cargo, where it fully encapsulates an H2A-H2B dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Thus, whilst a divergent histone interaction between Imp4 and Imp5 should not be ruled out, it seems likely that Imp5 binds to H3 and H4 in a similar way as Imp4, but potentially with more emphasis on the H3 N-terminal region, having lost the necessity for an H3-H4 dimer substrate.</p><p id="P35">Imp5 binding to H3 precludes NASP interaction, both in proteomic analyses and in <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments, with the nuclear localisation of NASP suggesting NASP acts downstream of Imp5 in the histone chaperoning pathway. The TPR domain of NASP has two distinct interaction sites with histone H3: an H3 N-terminal binding surface and an H3 3 binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Overlapping binding sites likely explains the H3 N-terminal competition between importin and chaperone that we see, however, if this were the only Imp5 interaction site one might expect NASP to remain bound through the H3 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Additional interactions between imp5 and the histone fold domain of H3 could be one explanation for the lack of trimeric complex. Alternatively, H3α3 binding by NASP may be more complex and require additional factors. In either case, we show it is RanGTP that provides the switch necessary for release of H3 from the importin, which is in contrast to Imp9-H2A-H2B, where RanGTP alone was insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), highlight further diversity amongst importin-<italic>β</italic> proteins and their handling of histones.</p><p id="P36">If newly synthesised H3 and H4 are rapidly imported into the nucleus as monomers bound to Imp5, what is the role of the long-established Imp4-H3-H4-ASF1 complex? One explanation is that Imp4 recognises post-nuclear H3-H4-ASF1, promoting the re-import of H3-H4 dimers that may have escaped. Indeed, the H3-H4-ASF1 complex could be small enough to transit the nuclear pore passively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), with ASF1, unlike NASP, not containing a nuclear localisation sequence. Furthermore, pure cytosolic extracts without nucleoplasmic leakage are difficult to obtain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), further promoting the appearance of H3-H4-ASF1 in the cytosol. To compound this, ss nuclear import of histones occurs rapidly after synthesis, the small pool of Imp5-associated histones present at any one time is likely obscured in these biochemical analyses.</p><p id="P37">The necessity to sequester monomeric histones in the nucleus may relate to the folding kinetics of H3-H4. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that H3-H4 folding is the rate-limiting step in the dimerisation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), with a milisecond timescale comparable to that of nuclear pore transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). NASP may therefore be regarded as having a ’holdase’ function, as has been suggested for the ATP-independent small heat shock protein family of molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), preventing aggregation of H3 in the nuclear milieu before encountering H4. It is interesting that it is specifically sNASP rather than tNASP that co-separates with the H3 monomer, suggesting alternative functions for these two splice isoforms. tNASP incorporates exon 8 that functionally extends the acidic region of sNASP. How this insertion mediates the differing binding profiles we see would be an interesting future question. The role of NASP as a holdase is easily reconciled with the idea of NASP overseeing a reservoir of soluble histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), which would be compatible with its acting in the nucleus. In addition, the presence of NASP in downstream complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), mediated by interactions outside of the TPR-H3 peptide interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), supports NASP guiding the transition from monomeric import to a heterodimer capable of DNA deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The holoenzyme HAT1-RBBP7’s interaction with monomeric H4 mutants suggests that HAT1-RBBP7 may function as a counterpart to NASP-H3, accepting H4 from Imp5 in the nucleus prior to folding.

Note, the tNASP isofrom is more prevalent, but only the sNASP isoform co-migrates with monomeric H3. <bold>G</bold>: Mass spectrometry identification of sNASP-interacting factors from gel slices shown in E (Total precursor intensity). tNASP-specific peptides are shown separately to pan-NASP peptide. <bold>H</bold>: Diagrammatic representation of NASP-containing complexes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS150537-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>H3 binding by Imp5 and sNASP is mutually exclusive and relies on RanGTP for histone transfer.</title><p><bold>A</bold>: Imp5-H3 reconstituted complex was purified by SEC and incubated on ice (control) for 3 hours before separating through ultracentrifugation on a 5-40% glycerol gradient. <bold>B</bold>: As in A, reconstituted complex was incubated on ice with equimolar concentration of sNASP (competition assay) for 3 hours before ultracentrifugation. H3 elutes with Imp5, whereas sNASP elutes in its separate fraction. <bold>C</bold>: As in B, but adding Ran in equimolar concentrations to sNASP and Imp-H3. Ran in its purified state is unable to bind to Imp5 and compete with H3. <bold>D</bold>: As in B, but adding RanGTP in equimolar concentrations to sNASP and Imp5-H3 complex. In this instance, RanGTP associates with Imp5 and displaces H3, which co-eultes with its chaperone sNASP.

Recruitment of a co-expressed soluble protein reports an interaction with the bait. Scale bar = 10 μm. B: Representative images of Imp4 and Imp5 interaction with tethered H3. C: Quantification of interactions shown in B using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient as a measure of colocalisation. Asterisks indicate plotting of previously published values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). D: Experimental design for incorporating RAPID-Release (RR) into the cytoplamsmically tethered H3 contruct. Functionalisation is introduced by adding required tags to the tether (top, examples in this case being eGFP and APEX2), which can be released along with the cargo (H3) to study interaction dynamics after the addition of rapamycin (bottom). E: Imp5 dissociates from H3 as it is released from its tether and enters the nucleus, suggesting a rapid hand-over mechanism. F: Nuclear import rate of H3.1-eGFP and H3.1-APEX-eGFP. Single cells are represented as grey dots. Averages are highlighted as blue (H3.1-eGFP) and red (H3.1-APEX-eGFP). Note, H3.1-eGFP nuclear import plateaus within 20 minutes whereas H3.1-APEX-eGFP requires up to 60 minutes. G: Volcano plot representing label-free mass spectrometry quantification analysis (LFQ) after streptavidin pull-down of proximity labeled proteins at 0 min (cytoplasm) or 120 min (nucleus) post rapamycin addition. Interacting factors are colour-coded according to their main subcellular location: cyotoplasm (cyto) yellow, mitochondria (mito) orange, nucleus (nuc) blue and other in grey (The Human Protein Atlas version 21.1).
