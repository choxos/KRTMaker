However, because longitudinal studies of mole-rats in their natural environment are uncommon, the extent to which successful reproduction by breeders relies on assistance from other group members is unclear, and for non-breeders, the immediate and delayed fitness consequences of staying and helping are poorly understood. Using data from a 7-year field study of marked individuals, we investigate whether increasing group size confers reproductive and survival benefits to breeders and non-breeders, and explore the different routes through which individuals acquire breeding positions. We show that solitary natal dispersal was the most common route to breeding for both sexes and that the inheritance of dominant breeding positions was uncommon in both sexes. After dispersing, females typically settled alone in new burrow systems where they enjoyed high survival rates and remained in good body condition - often for several years - before being joined by males. In contrast to most obligately cooperative species, pairs of potential breeders reproduced successfully without helpers and experimentally formed pairs had the same reproductive success as larger established groups. Though larger breeding groups recruited slightly more pups on average, our data suggest that neither survival nor reproduction depend on the presence of non-breeding helpers, indicating that Damaraland mole-rats are not obligate cooperative breeders. We suggest that extended philopatry and group living in Damaraland mole-rats have evolved because of the high costs and constraints of dispersal rather than because of strong indirect benefits accrued through cooperative behaviour and that similarities between their breeding systems and those of obligatorily eusocial insects have been over-emphasized.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sociality</kwd><kwd>cooperative breeding</kwd><kwd>inclusive fitness</kwd><kwd>philopatry</kwd><kwd>family living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">In some animal societies juveniles choose to remain in their natal group for extended periods of time and do not breed instead of dispersing and attempting to breed independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In some of these species, retained offspring but provide no direct assistance in rearing young produced by dominant breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), while in others that are usually referred to as cooperative breeders, they provision young born in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In ‘facultative’ cooperative breeders, breeding groups may or may not include non-breeding helpers and breeders are able to rear young without assistance from non-breeders while in more specialised ‘obligate’ cooperative breeders, helpers have substantial effects on the reproductive success of breeding individuals and breeders are usually unable to rear young successfully without assistance from non-breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The social African mole-rats (<italic>Bathyergidae</italic>), which include naked mole-rats (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) and Damaraland mole-rats (<italic>Fukomys damarensis</italic>), are often regarded as among the most specialised cooperative breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Groups of social mole-rats usually consist of a single breeding pair and several litters of offspring that have delayed dispersal and refrain from reproduction while living in their natal group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The principal cooperative activity of non-breeding individuals is to maintain a network of tunnels that provide access to underground plant tubers and to bring food to food stores that are accessible to all group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), though non-breeders of both sexes also groom and retrieve pups born to the dominant female if they stray from the breeding nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The extensive involvement of many non-breeders in cooperative foraging has led to the suggestion that social mole-rats rely on a workforce for reproduction and survival, and the idea that there are strong benefits of group-living to breeders is implicit in most discussions surrounding the evolution of sociality in the African mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Early studies of mole-rats emphasized similarities between their breeding systems and those of obligatorily eusocial insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and both naked and Damaraland mole-rats are often referred to as eusocial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). However, despite the broad interest in the evolution of mole-rat sociality, longitudinal studies of wild mole-rat populations remain uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). One study of wild Damaraland mole-rats has investigated the demographic effects of group size in social mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and has shown that larger groups recruited more offspring. In the same study, juvenile survival was independent of group size and juvenile growth rate was reduced in large groups, possibly by competition between non-breeders. Breeding females have also been shown to have lower workloads than non-breeders, both in a separate population of Damaraland mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) and in captive animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). It is not yet known whether breeding pairs without helpers are able to raise offspring to independence, and it is still unclear whether social mole-rats are facultative or obligate cooperative breeders and whether living in groups increases the survival of group members.</p><p id="P7">We also know little about the dynamics of mole-rat groups or about the paths by which individual achieve breeding status in natural mole-rat populations. In some of the most well-studied obligate cooperative mammals, pairs of individuals without helpers usually fail to breed successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). New groups typically form and successfully breed when coalitions of individuals disperse and settle together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), when large groups fission into smaller, distinct breeding units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), or when a breeding territory including helpers is inherited by existing group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Similar patterns of group formation as in obligate cooperative mammals are seen in many eusocial insect societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), and various studies have suggested that the fissioning of large groups may also be an important driver of new group formation in the social mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). However, research on numerous mole-rat populations also indicates that the dispersal of solitary individuals is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>), and evidence of individuals living singly in burrow systems has repeatedly been remarked upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). The survival rate of single individuals and the frequency with which these individuals form new breeding groups has not been quantified, but if it represents an important route to breeding, then it would suggest that mole-rats do not need a workforce to reproduce successfully.</p><p id="P8">In this study we investigate how new breeding groups emerge and determine whether reproductive success depends on the presence of non-breeders in a wild population of Damaraland mole-rats. We first describe how new groups form and then we assess whether individuals living in groups (breeders and non-breeders) experience higher survivorship than individuals that have dispersed and settled solitarily. By experimentally creating breeding pairs in the field, we examine whether the reproductive output of breeders lacking non-breeding group members is lower than that of established groups which have access to a potential workforce. Lastly, we use demographic information collected across 7 years of field study to analyse the associations of group size with (i) reproductive success, (ii) adult survival, and (iii) growth of recruited offspring, testing the prediction that large group size is associated with increases in reproductive success and survival, and enhances growth among young individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>a)</label><title>Population structure and distribution of group sizes</title><p id="P9">The mean group size at our study site in the Kalahari across all captures between 2013 and 2020 was 5.91 ± 5.61 individuals (mean ± SD; max = 26; n = 328 group captures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The timing of departure from the natal group coincided with periods when ecological constraints were relaxed through increased rainfall (MSM: hazard ratio = 1.355, 95% CI [1.205,1.523]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The large number of single females reflects a broader divergence in the life history trajectories of the two sexes after departure from their natal group. Post-dispersal, females usually settled as single individuals, whereas males left their natal group and sought to locate females and seldom settled on their own. We identified 23 females in our population whose route to breeding could be determined accurately. Of these 23, 60.9% (n = 14) were females that had dispersed from their group, settled singly, and were later joined by one or more emigrant males to start a nascent breeding group. Two further females became breeders through territory budding, having dispersed and subsisting alone in a burrow system directly adjacent to but separate from their natal burrow, with males subsequently immigrating in. In contrast, 30.3% of breeding females (n = 7) inherited a breeding position in their natal burrow system after the disappearance of the previous dominant female. Females never immigrated into established groups and cases of female inheritance were always associated with the loss of the incumbent breeding female, either following group collapses that left a single female that was later joined by a male forming a new pair (n = 3), or replacement of the breeding female by a natal female who continued to reproduce in the group (n = 4).</p><p id="P12">For males, joining single females in newly established or inherited burrow systems (n = 16), or immigrating into established groups (n = 13), were both common routes through which males accessed unfamiliar females. Without paternity information it remains unknown whether these males were the father of all offspring born post-immigration; though cases of multiple male immigration (from either the same or from different groups) were infrequent (n = 3 cases). For the same reason, it is unclear whether males ever inherited breeding positions in their natal group; however, the fact that groups often collapsed after the death of the breeding female, coupled with the lack of female immigration, makes male inheritance improbable.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>c)</label><title>Status-related survivorship among females</title><p id="P13">Once settled, single females exhibited high annual survival rates and disappeared from the population at rates intermediate between those of breeders and those of non-breeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>); their estimated annual survival was higher (79.3%) than that of in-group non-breeding females (64.2%) and was lower than that of breeding females (86.7%). Thus, in-group non-breeding females were 1.91 times more likely to disappear from the population than single females (MSM: ratio of transition probabilities; 95% CI [1.07,3.43]), and 3.28 times more likely to disappear than breeding females (MSM: 95% CI [1.84,5.82]). The rate of disappearance of single females was higher than that of breeding females, with the former being 1.71 times more likely to disappear than the latter, though this effect was not significant (MSM: 95% CI [0.78,3.77], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Group size did not affect the likelihood that non-breeding females (MSM: hazard ratio = 1.003, 95% CI [0.973,1.033]) or breeding females (MSM: hazard ratio = 1.058, 95% CI [0.970,1.156]) disappeared.</p><p id="P14">Single females maintained good body condition over extended periods, frequently over several years. Their body condition was equivalent to that of size-matched non-breeding females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that solitary living does not affect the ability of individuals to acquire food and maintain mass (condition analyses outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>d)</label><title>Within-group recruitment</title><p id="P15">Experimentally created pairs recruited a similar number of offspring into their group as established groups that were captured and recaptured over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; Welch’s t-test, t = 0.253, df = 14.02, p = 0.80; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref> details capture history after pairing). The recruitment rate in experimental and control groups over the experimental period was comparable to the total recruitment rate over the whole study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and environmental conditions across the experimental period were typical of those seen in the Kalahari over a longer time span (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Across the duration of the study, increasing group size was associated with a modest increase in within-group recruitment rate (GLMM: 0.216 ± 0.106, z = 2.04, p = 0.042, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Changing the group size term to reflect the mean group size across the capture and recapture event did not qualitatively affect the result. Increased rainfall in the year prior to the first trapping showed a positive but non-significant effect on recruitment (geometric mean monthly rainfall, GLMM: 0.159 ± 0.086, z = 1.85, p = 0.065), and the body mass of the breeding female did not significantly affect recruitment (GLMM: -0.090 ± 0.089, z = -1.02, p = 0.31). The inclusion of an interaction between rainfall and group size suggested that the effect of group size on recruitment rate did not depend upon recently experienced weather conditions (GLMM: 0.108 ± 0.080, z = 1.36, p = 0.17).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>e)</label><title>Early-life growth and adult body mass</title><p id="P17">In both sexes, increases in group size were associated with faster growth rates in early life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).

Our demographic analysis of wild Damaraland mole-rats shows that a substantial proportion of individuals are females that have dispersed and settled alone in a burrow system. We find that these solitary individuals display high survivorship and maintain a body condition that is comparable to individuals living in groups, despite being forced to forage alone and lacking access to other putative benefits of group-living, such as the benefits of group defence, or social thermoregulation. Once joined by a male, these nascent pairs often begin breeding immediately and produce pups at a rate which is similar to that of established groups, in spite of the lack of helpers and the known developmental costs of reproduction in inexperienced breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). For this reason, Damaraland mole-rats should not be considered obligate cooperative breeders.</p><p id="P19">In demonstrating that solitary dispersal can bring reproductive rewards, our study also emphasises that female Damaraland mole-rats acquire breeding positions in ways that differ from many other cooperative mammals. In many obligate cooperative mammals, the inheritance of breeding positions - including the natal territory and pre-existing helpers - often forms the most successful route to breeding for the habitually philopatric sex, and if individuals of either sex disperse, then they typically do so in same-sex coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Single dispersers or small coalitions have difficulty establishing new breeding groups in many of these species and the effects of group size on fitness is often initially strongly positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). Group founding in obligate and facultatively eusocial insects is also characterised by high chances of group failure, which are commonly reduced when several queens establish new nests together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>) or when colonies fission into spatially distinct breeding units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). In our study population of Damaraland mole-rats, we found that territory inheritance was relatively uncommon in both sexes and that solitary dispersal by males and females was the most frequent route to the acquisition of a breeding position. Though solitary dispersal likely carries a high mortality risk since dispersal is often overground and mole-rats are anatomically and physiologically adapted for subterranean living, extrinsic mortality appears to be low once individuals have settled in a burrow system and have access to a supply of plant tubers.</p><p id="P20">The relative rarity of territory inheritance in our study population may be related to the low rate of successful male immigration into established groups. Most social mole-rat groups are nuclear families and females will not readily mate with their father or brothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). As a result, natal individuals typically lack access to unrelated mating partners and if either breeder dies, all group members may slowly disperse and groups may dissolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The fact that females rarely inherit a breeding position might also explain why sex differences in dispersal timing are small in Damaraland mole-rats (this study, 68) compared to other cooperative breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>), and why males and females invest similarly in cooperative foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>), with neither sex standing to gain more from helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Like previous studies of social mole-rats both in captivity and in natural populations we found that rates of recruitment are higher in larger groups than in smaller ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and that the work load of breeders probably declined with increasing group size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), indicating that the presence of non-breeding helpers may contribute to breeding success or offspring survival. In addition, positive associations between group size and female fecundity have also been shown in captive Damaraland mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, in many other social animals, group size, breeding success and growth often increase in groups occupying more productive ranges and habitats so that associations between group size and breeding success do not necessarily reflect causal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). As yet, the extent to which the involvement of non-breeders in alloparental care contributes to the growth and survival of juveniles or to the fecundity of breeding females is unclear. However, in contrast to obligatorily eusocial insects as well as to some of the more specialised cooperatively breeding vertebrates where helpers contribute substantially to the provisioning of dependant young, this study shows that Damaraland mole-rats can survive and breed successfully without assistance from nonbreeders, suggesting that in our population the benefits of the presence of non-breeders may be small or inconsistent.</p><p id="P22">As in many other cooperative breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>) constraints on dispersal may play an important role in the evolution of sociality in mole-rats, as they appear to in many group-living rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>) and some carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The high costs of dispersal may also explain why dispersal in social mole-rats is concentrated around intermittent periods of rainfall when the soil is soft enough to facilitate burrow digging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>), permitting the establishment of new burrows. Breeders may also tolerate non-breeders remaining in their group as a form of extended parental care, even if their retained offspring provide limited fitness benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><label>a)</label><title>General methods</title><p id="P23">Damaraland mole-rats were captured in the area surrounding the Kuruman River Reserve (-26.978560, 21.832459) in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa between September 2013 and May 2020 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref> for distribution and climate). Field work was carried out at two neighbouring localities, the Kuruman River Reserve (“Kuruman”), and the Lonely farm (“Lonely”, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 &amp; S3</xref>). The two locations form a continuous population but because of the time intensive nature of mole-rat trapping they tended to be trapped in discrete periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 &amp; S5</xref>), hereafter referred to as “trapping windows”. For logistical reasons, trapping stopped at Lonely in July 2017.</p><p id="P24">Groups of mole-rats in the wild are revealed by the lines of mounds that they extrude when excavating their tunnel systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Groups were trapped periodically at 6 to 12-month intervals using modified Hickman traps that were baited with sweet potato and positioned into tunnel systems once accessed by digging. After trap setting, traps were checked every 2-3 hours throughout the day and night. On capture, animals were placed into a closed box and provided with food and shelter. Intermittently, individuals were transported back to the laboratory where they were sexed, weighed to the nearest gram and measured for various morphometrics. Breeding females are commonly the largest female in their group and can be easily identified from their perforated vagina and prominent teats. All captured individuals were marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags on first capture to allow for individual recognition on recapture. After sampling, groups were housed temporarily in semi-natural tunnel systems in the laboratory and provided with food, nesting material and sand. The complete group was assumed to have been captured after an absence of activity at the trap sites for 24 hours, after which point the animals were returned to their tunnel system. The average time to capture a group was 2.73 ± 1.67 days (mean ± SD).</p><p id="P25">Between September 2013 and May 2020, 752 unique individuals (368 females, 384 males) were trapped at the two sites (N = 1941 individual captures). The mean recapture rate of individuals across successive trapping windows was 73.1 ± 10.8% at Kuruman and 54.8 ± 14.4% at Lonely (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In total, analyses used data from 328 group captures that were carried out at 84 groups with an average of 3.90 ± 2.99 captures per group (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Groups were defined as individuals repeatedly found at the same trapping location, and in the majority of recapture events the same breeding female remained at a group for their duration. Thus, as long as the majority of individuals trapped within the same area were known to originate from the same group, the group continued to be defined as such. On several occasions a new group had moved into the tunnel system previously occupied by another group. The initial group were then either found elsewhere or never recaptured and likely extinct. Single individuals, either new unknown individuals or known individuals that had dispersed from an established group were assigned their own unique group ID, which was retained if they were later joined by an immigrant partner and started breeding in the same area.</p><p id="P26">In 15.2% of group captures, continued activity at trapping sites indicated that the complete group had not been captured by the end of the week of trapping. The decision to include or exclude these incomplete captures depended on the analysis: group-level analyses excluded incomplete captures whereas individual-level analyses included them (a summary of the data and models used for the various analyses is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.).

Such models are typically used in a medical setting for ‘panel data’, where a continuously observed process - like disease progression - is measured only at discrete time points - when people choose to visit the hospital. The timing of transitions between states can then be estimated indirectly under the assumption that the next state in a sequence of states depends only on the current state, and not on the history of transitions or on the time spent in the prior state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). Our longitudinal data bears a panel-like structure, with individuals and groups being periodically captured (or not) in different life history stages or ‘states’. The model then estimates the probability that individual mole-rats transition between different states. Here, we present information on survival probability from each state.</p><p id="P28">Information on individual capture histories was used to assign females to one of four states relative to the time since their first capture: <italic>i- non-breeder</italic> in their natal group, ii- <italic>single female, iii- breeding female</italic> out of their natal group, <italic>iv- disappeared/dead</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). For model fitting purposes, in the small number of cases where females inherited a breeding position within their natal group (n = 7), these females were categorised in the same state as females that acquired a breeding position out of their natal group (<italic>iii).</italic> To define state <italic>iv</italic> (disappeared/died), we incorporated information from the trapping windows at “Kuruman” and “Lonely”. If an individual had not been recaptured for at least two consecutive trapping windows, it was assumed to have dispersed or died at some point between its last live capture and the start of the subsequent trapping window, and given an extra row of data reflecting this; the model is then parameterised so that the timing of disappearance or death is not exact. Similarly, if individuals were captured within the last trapping window at each location, we assumed that they were still alive at the end of that trapping window (i.e. the end of the study). They were then given an extra row of data reflecting this assumption and were censored at this point, which in the most extreme case assumes that individuals remained in their last captured state for a further 80 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). The multi-state analysis included 326 females that were captured as a <italic>non-breeder</italic> in their natal group at some point in the study, 45 females captured as a <italic>single female,</italic> and 46 captured as a <italic>breeding female.</italic> To explore whether group size affected the likelihood that non-breeding females or breeding females died/disappeared, we fitted an additional model that included a group size covariate for each of these transitions. The multi-state models were fitted in the <italic>msm</italic> package (87; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref> for multi-state diagram). When reporting hazard ratios and relative likelihoods from the multi-state models we class cases where the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap one as indicating a biologically important effect, while also emphasizing effect sizes. To directly compare survivorship among the different classes of female, we also calculated the ratio of the transition intensities from each alive state (<italic>i, ii,</italic> or <italic>iii</italic>) to death/disappearance (<italic>iv</italic>), with 95% confidence intervals computed using the delta method (<italic>qratio.msm</italic> function).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>c)</label><title>Within-group recruitment</title><p id="P29">Two approaches were used to investigate the role of group size on within-group recruitment. In the first, recruitment was analysed longitudinally across the duration of the study. In the second, new groups were experimentally created in the wild through the introduction of unfamiliar adult males to solitary females. The recruitment rate of newly created pairs was then compared to that of established groups that were captured and recaptured within the same time period. The benefit of the second approach is that it allows for a direct test of whether groups in the early stages of group formation were less productive than established groups. Any individuals caught within one year that were lighter than 100g (males) or 80g (females) were assumed to be recruited from within the group, as informed by the growth curves. By contrast, any new individuals heavier than these cut-offs were assumed to represent out-of-group immigrants.</p><p id="P30">The longitudinal analysis used information from every capture-recapture event where a group was captured and then recaptured within a 100 to 365-day time period; where a resident breeding female was present; and where at least one large male was retained across the two captures. The analysis is therefore restricted to active breeding units. In total, this produced a dataset of 78 group-level capture-recapture events that took place in 33 groups with a mean trapping interval of 214.2 ± 52.1 days (mean ± SD). The number of recruits was modelled using a generalised linear mixed effects model (GLMM) with Poisson error in the <italic>glmmTMB</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Fixed effects of group size at first capture, the mass of the breeding female at the capture, and rainfall were included. A single random effect of group identity was included, and the logged time interval between capture and recapture was included as an offset term. Rainfall was calculated as the geometric mean monthly rainfall in the year preceding the first capture as this provided the best fit to the data (lowest AIC score) when compared to models fitted to the total rainfall, or the arithmetic mean rainfall. After standardising relative to the trapping duration, the mean 6-monthly recruitment to groups was 2.12 ± 1.82 individuals (mean ± SD). Continuous variables were z-score transformed prior to model fitting.</p><p id="P31">For the experimental approach, 8 solitary females were captured between 16<sup>th</sup> April 2016 and 29<sup>th</sup> May 2016. Solitary females were brought back into the laboratory and paired with wild males captured concurrently from intact breeding groups. When pairing, males and females were first isolated in their own temporary tunnel system and exposed to the odour of their prospective partner for 24 hours. After this time period, the male was introduced to the female for 24 hours in her lab tunnel system, before they were returned together to the female’s tunnel system in the wild. All pairings used large adult males originating from groups &gt; 3km from the focal solitary female, so it is highly unlikely that pairings were conducted between close relatives and/or familiar individuals. The recruitment rate of new pairs was compared to that of established groups captured over the same time period using a Welch's t-test after first standardising recruitment rate to a yearly measure. Groups where a male was removed were not included in the established groups treatment in case the male was a breeder in his original group, which would necessarily reduce the rate of recruitment. The mean trapping interval did not differ between new pairs (249.89 ± 94.34 days; mean ± SD) and established groups (306.88 ± 64.39 days; mean ± SD; Welch’s t-test: t = -1.47, df = 14.14, p = 0.16).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>d)</label><title>Early-life growth</title><p id="P32">As the age of wild-caught individuals was unknown, we modelled growth using interval equations that estimated the change in body mass and upper incisor width of individuals across successive capture events.

Incisor width was measured at the widest point using digital callipers (to the nearest 0.01mm). All measurements were taken in duplicate by two observers and the mean of these two measurements was used.

In this study we show that in wild Damaraland mole-rats, the presence of non-breeders is associated with both costs and benefits and that nascent breeding pairs show high reproductive success despite the lack of non-breeding helpers. These findings indicate that Damaraland mole-rats are not obligate cooperative breeders and suggest that similarities between their breeding systems and those of obligatorily eusocial insects have been over-emphasized.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Group sizes for Damaraland mole-rats in the southern Kalahari.</title><p>(a) An adult Damaraland mole-rat. (b) A line of sand mounds that is created by a group of mole-rats when they dig foraging tunnels underground. (c) The distribution of group sizes in the study population at the Kuruman River Reserve. The main histogram displays group size frequencies across all captures, while the inset histogram displays the group size at first capture for each unique group (n = 82; including single individuals). In each case, a large proportion of the population were captured as single individuals (orange), who were almost exclusively females. The vertical lines display the mean group size either including (orange) or excluding (black) these single individuals, and for all captures, we distinguish between complete and incomplete group captures by hatching the latter (mean for all complete group captures = 5.45, 1SD = 5.51; mean for complete captures of groups &gt; 1 = 8.54, 1SD = 5.32). Removing the 15.2% of incomplete captures had limited influence on the mean group size (not displayed).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS144730-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Status-related survivorship of female Damaraland mole-rats: in-group non-breeders (a), single females (b), and breeding females (c).</title><p>Solid lines display the expected probability of survival from each state as estimated from the multi-state Markov model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>). Dotted lines display the ‘empirical’ Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival probability, with crosses denoting cases of right-censoring. Here, survival strictly refers to disappearance from the study population, and the predicted annual probability of disappearance (mean ± 95% CI) is given in (d). ‘Survival’ therefore combines cases of in-state mortality with cases of dispersal, where individuals have left their current group and state and are not re-captured thereafter. Dispersal is most likely to account for a large proportion of disappearances from the in-group non-breeder state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and the low incidence of recaptures of individuals thereafter implies that dispersal carries a high cost of mortality.
