<p id="P1">In times of crisis, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain of filtering facepiece respirators, such as N95 respirators, are disrupted. To combat shortages of N95 respirators, many institutions were forced to decontaminate and reuse respirators. While several reports have evaluated the impact on filtration as a measurement of preservation of respirator function after decontamination, the equally important fact of maintaining proper fit to the users’ face has been understudied. In the current study, we demonstrate the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of fit test performance of N95 respirators following treatment with dry heat. We apply scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements to analyze filter material changes as a consequence of different decontamination treatments. We further compared the integrity of the respirator after autoclaving versus dry heat treatment via quantitative fit testing and found that autoclaving, but not dry heat, causes the fit of the respirator onto the users face to fail, thereby rendering the decontaminated respirator unusable.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, is predominantly by aerosol, therefore N95 respirators, which are intended to exclude 95 percent of particulates in the size range that encompasses most aerosolized viral droplets, including SARS-CoV-2, are recommended for protection of health care providers during patient encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers was pushed to its limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), necessitating the implementation of various protocols for the reuse of PPE by healthcare facilities throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recently issued additional guidance for the reuse of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR), such as N95 respirators, when there are shortages of respirator masks at healthcare facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">While fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be a major source of virus transmission in the general population, minimizing its risk in healthcare workers is still an important consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 surface stability is affected by multiple factors, including the material that it contacts, the relative humidity of the environment, and the temperature at which it is exposed to. During times of crisis, both the CDC and other organizations including 3M, a major respirator manufacturer, have frequently cited ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and moist heat as recommended methods for decontamination of FFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). These methods, however, often call for specific equipment that may prove difficult to obtain and/or difficult to implement in many healthcare facilities and in the general public.</p>
<p id="P4">Heat is potentially more readily accessible than other methods of decontamination in many healthcare facilities. Although autoclaving (i.e., steam at ~121°C and &gt; 15 psi) is a proven method of sterilization of most pathogens, it is not viable for decontamination of used N95 respirators because moist heat can degrade filter efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In culture medium, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be inactivated by dry heat treatment in as little as 5 minutes at 70°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and exposure of SARS Cov-2 on surfaces to dry heat at &gt;70°C for &gt;30 minutes is sufficient to achieve a ≥3-log reduction of viral titers, meeting FDA recommendations for FFR reuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">While several reports have evaluated the impact on filtration as a measurement of preservation of respirator function after decontamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), the equally important fact of maintaining proper fit to the wearer’s face has been understudied. Per both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Part 84 Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (NIOSH 42 CFR 84) and the FDA, respirators must be assessed for not only filter performance, but also fit, i.e., the sealant performance between mask on the individual’s face. Respirator mask fit testers such as the TSI PortaCount Pro 8048 are employed to rapidly obtain OSHA compliant fit factors that quantitatively evaluate whether a respirator fits properly on an individual’s face. The fit factor is derived by comparing particle counts outside the mask with ones inside the mask. Clearly, the mask fit test only passes if filtration material and sealant to face are in order. In other words, if the mask fit test is successful, it implicitly means that also the filtration material is operating satisfactorily. If the mask fit test fails (fit factor &lt; 100), it can either mean that the mask-to-face seal or filtration material failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Thus, a successful mask fit test implies that a given decontamination method is not altering the filtration material and mask fit significantly.</p>

<title>Heat Treatment</title>
<p id="P12">N95 respirators were placed in a paper bag and sealed with a piece of heat-stable tape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). The bags were placed onto a metal rack which was loaded into a TPS Gruenberg truck-in oven. Unless otherwise specified, all N95 respirators were treated for four cycles at either 80°C for 60 minutes or 100°C for 30 minutes, with at least 10 minutes of cooling time to room temperature in between. Autoclaved respirators were subjected to a single cycle of 121°C at 15-25 psi for 30 minutes.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 Thermal Stability</title>
<p id="P13">The SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from BEI Resources and used for the experiments in this study. VeroE6 cells were obtained from ATCC and used to titer and passage the SARS-COV-2 virus. VeroE6 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM containing Glutagro (Corning) and 8% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All growth and manipulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed under BSL3 containment conditions.</p>
<p id="P14">Approximately 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 virus in DMEM was spotted in triplicate onto a N95 mask for each condition and the masks were left to dry within the biosafety cabinet for 2 hours at room temperature. N95 masks containing SARS-COV-2 virus were either left at room temperature or treated with dry-heat using a TPS/Tenney T2 series (Tenney Environmental) small dry-heat sterilizer for the indicated time and temperature. As a negative control, N95 masks were treated similarly with DMEM media alone and left at room temperature during heat treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Virus recovery and quantification</title>
<p id="P15">SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered by cutting each virus-treated spot, including all three mask layers, from each N95 mask and placing each spot in an Eppendorf screw-cap tube containing 1 mL DMEM plus 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml amphotericin B. Samples were submerged and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature then rocked gently by hand for 5 minutes to recover virus. Plaque assays were performed to quantify the amount of virus recovered by performing serial dilutions of recovered virus and infecting VeroE6 cells seeded at 4.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture treated plate for one hour. Cells were then overlaid with DMEM containing 0.8% tragacanth gum, 2.5% FBS, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml amphotericin B and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 hours. To quantify the amount of virus recovered, the overlay was removed, and the plaques were visualized by staining VeroE6 cells with 0.5% crystal violet and 0.8% glutaraldehyde in 50% methanol for 10 minutes followed by several washes with distilled water. Total PFU/mL for each condition was calculated by averaging the mean PFU/mL recovered for each biological replicate (n=3).</p>

<title>N95 FFR Quantitative Fit Tests</title>
<p id="P16">A PortaCount Pro 8048 (TSI, Shoreview, MN) was used to obtain OSHA compliant quantitative fit factors at Stony Brook University Hospital, in the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for most N95 FFRs is around 300 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). For this reason, the quantitative fit testing protocols evaluate leakages at particle size ranges outside of the MPPS to be more sensitive to leakages across the sealant between mask and face. The principle of operation is to choose a particle size, typically about 40 nm, that is filtered with great efficiency due to electrostatic interactions and to compare the number concentration of those particles outside the mask (i.e. ambient air), the particle concentration inside the mask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Detection of those particles is achieved by a condensation particle counters (CPC) that grows these small particles via condensation of vapor to size detectable via light scattering. Quantitative fit testing was performed on the same operator for all mask types and for all conditions: dry heat treated (n = 3), untreated (n = 1), and autoclaved (n = 1) respirators.</p>
<p id="P17">Quantitative fit testing procedures for N95 respirators were performed according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines found in Appendix A to §1910.134. N95 respirators were fitted with a mask sampling adapter that allows for the measurement of particles inside the respirator while donned by an individual. Four exercises were performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and fit factors for each exercise were calculated by taking the ratio of the concentration of ambient particles to the concentration of particles inside the respirator. The overall fit factor is calculated as the ratio of the # of exercises to the sum of the reciprocal of the fit factors for each exercise. Overall fit factor scores of ≥ 100 passes OSHA guidelines. <disp-formula id="FD1">

<title>SARS-CoV-2 thermal Stability on N95 Respirators</title>
<p id="P25">SARS-CoV-2 thermal stability on 3M Particulate Respirator 1860 N95 material was evaluated by spotting 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 onto N95 respirators. After incubating the N95 respirators at 80°C for 60 minutes, 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of viable virus was recovered from the respirator, demonstrating a 2-log reduction of virus as compared to samples that were kept at room temperature. Treatment of the inoculated N95 respirators at 100°C however, returned no viable virus, demonstrating a ≥ 5-log reduction of virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative Fit Testing of N95 Respirators</title>
<p id="P26">Quantitative fit testing was performed on four models of N95 respirators after autoclaving or dry heat incubation at either 100°C for 30 minutes or 80°C for 60 minutes. For all respirator types, autoclaving resulted in failed quantitative fit testing (fit factor &lt; 100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast, dry heat incubation yielded passing fit test scores (≥100) for all the respirators that passed quantitative fit testing prior to any treatment. None of the Bacou Willson 801 respirators passed quantitative fit testing, presumably due to poor fit on the user. It is notable, however, that masks which were autoclaved yielded a lower fit factor than either the untreated, 100°C, or the 80°C dry heat treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>).</p>

Layer-1 is ~300 μm in thickness, with millimeter scale patterning, comprised of microfibers with a diameter ~20 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). Layer-2 is ~300 μm in thickness, comprised of microfibers with a diameter in the range of 1-10 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). Layer-3 is ~1 mm in thickness, comprised of microfibers with a diameter ~30 μm, and some defects were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>). The morphologies of the 100°C dry heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f-h</xref>) and autoclave treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4i-k</xref>) of 3M 1860 N95 did not show obvious differences from SEM images.</p>
<p id="P28">Raman spectra were obtained for all of the layers of the 3M 1860 respirator. The broad asymmetric band observed at approximately 830 cm<sup>−1</sup> apparently splits into two bands at 808 and 840 cm<sup>−1</sup> upon crystallization. This indicates that the 830 cm<sup>−1</sup> band is a fundamental frequency of the chemical repeat unit that is altered by the symmetry of the helical chain conformation due to inter-molecular coupling between adjacent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The 810 cm<sup>−1</sup> band can be assigned to helical chains within crystals, while a broader band at 840 cm<sup>−1</sup> assigned to chains in non-helical conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">Layer 1 showed significant fluorescence, as indicated by the broad peak features, possibly due to the dye used in this layer. Despite the strong fluorescence, a decrease in the ratio of two bands at 810 and 840 cm<sup>−1</sup> as well as the peak intensity at 972 cm<sup>−1</sup> after dry heat and autoclave treatment was noted, suggesting the shorting of the helical chain conformation of polypropylene after heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Notably, the peak at 1220 cm<sup>–1</sup> ascribed to the helical chain of 14 monomeric units of polypropylene suggested shorting of the helical chain length. Layer 2 (middle layer) and layer 3 (inner layer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b and 5c</xref>) also contain polypropylene fibers that are lower in crystallinity and narrower in thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was also performed to identify the composition and crystallinity of each layer before and after dry heat and autoclave treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>), showing no compositional changes and insignificant crystallite sizes changes after both types of treatment.</p>
<p id="P30">Contact angle measurements were performed to characterize the wetting properties of surfaces of the mask materials towards artificial saliva solution. Wetting describes the ability of a liquid to remain in contact with a given surface, and its qualities are dominated by van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Contact angle data serves to indicate the degree of wetting when a liquid interacts with a solid. A contact angle greater than 90° suggests low wettability and poor contact of the fluid with the surface, resulting in a compact liquid droplet. Favorable wettability of surface evinces a contact angle less than 90° and the fluids will spread over a large area of the measured surface. Saliva substitutes have been studied and are used in lieu of biological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">For the 3M 1860 N95 material, both the dry heat and autoclaving treatments show an increase in the observed contact angle in comparison to that of the pristine samples, with measured initial contact angles of 103.9°±7.7°, 105.4°±6.2°, and 96.0°±15.2°, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>). The treated samples’ contact angle values remain consistent over time, whereas the pristine sample showed a marked decrease. No significant differences in the droplet volume over time are observed for the three samples. For all three samples, the inner surface rate of absorption was too rapid to allow for measurements by contact angle with the 20 μL droplet being absorbed during the first 1 ms measurement interval.</p>
<p id="P32">In summary, material characterization of the N95 respirator material revealed some helical length shortening of the mask material and overall, no changes in neither the composition nor the crystallinity of any of the 3 layers of the respirator after dry heat treatment at 100°C or after autoclaving. Additionally, the contact angle measurement of artificial saliva showed minimal changes in the behavior of liquid droplets on the respirator material under the same conditions. Taken together, it can be concluded that the filtration material itself was not much affected by either treatment. Material characterization was also performed on the Bacou Willson 801 respirator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4-7 Fig</xref>) that showed similar results.</p>

<title>Estimated Filtration</title>
<p id="P33">Our data suggests that 100 °C dry heat treatment does not appreciably impact the FFR material and that autoclaving similarly does not appreciably impact the filter material. Applying the measured fit factors, we can estimate the hypothetical decrease in filtration efficiency assuming a perfect fit (i.e., perfect seal between face and mask). As outlined above, the mask fit test makes use of particles in the size range of ~40 nm that are commonly filtered with an efficiency of about 99.99% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). A fit factor of 100 and 200 corresponds to a filtration efficiency of 99 and 99.5% respectively (both imply passing of the fit test). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, the estimated filtration efficiency for autoclaved masks drops significantly below those thresholds, by 1.04 to 7.73%, while the estimated filter efficiencies dropped by &lt;1%, if at all, in the dry heat-treated groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P34">While most developed nations were able to deploy effective responses to mitigate supply chain shortages for PPE in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, many parts of the world are still forced to reuse N95 respirators even after exposure to symptomatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). PPE shortages, including limited supplies of N95-grade respirator masks, impacts a diverse set of healthcare facilities, from hospitals to nursing homes. The CDC acknowledges these shortages and offers guidance, based on an institutions’ burn rate (i.e., the rate at which N95 FFRs are used and disposed of) and crisis capacity strategies, whether N95 respirators are recommended for reuse and what methods for decontamination are authorized. The data in the current study offers an alternative and potentially more accessible method for decontamination of N95 respirators for reuse during crisis capacity. As the CDC recommends, limited FFR reuse should only be attempted when respirators are unsoiled, fit properly, and are undamaged (e.g., the straps and nosepiece are still intact and functional).</p>
<p id="P35">Consistent with previous studies, we observed a 2-log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titer after treatment at 80°C for 60 minutes and undetectable virus following treatment at 100°C for 30 minutes, meeting the minimum previously suggested 5-log reduction in virus by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Respirators subjected to dry heat maintained their gross structural integrity and the functionality of their straps and nosepieces after 4 cycles of sterilization. Similarly, dry heat sterilization after 4 cycles did not affect their fit as measured by quantitative fit testing. In contrast, autoclaved N95 respirators appeared to have some physical damages in the overall structure and shape of the respirators and failed quantitative fit testing in all respirator types tested. These results after autoclaving are consistent with other reports on most N95 respirator types that show degradation of the respirators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p>
<p id="P36">Material characterization of 3M 1860 N95 respirators, performed by SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD analysis, revealing some helical chain shortening, but no compositional or crystallite size changes in the microscopic structure of the 3 layers of the respirator after dry heat treatment. Similarly, autoclaving did not reveal any major changes in the material of the N95 respirator material. Contact angle characterization were also performed to evaluate any potential changes in the response to contact to liquids. The results demonstrated that the droplet volume remained consistent after either dry heat treatment or autoclave, although there was a slight increase in the contact angle after autoclave and dry heat treatment, suggesting that the absorption of liquids decreased after contact. Material characterization was also performed on the Bacou Willson 801 respirator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4-7 Fig</xref>) that revealed similar results.</p>
<p id="P37">Our data suggests that 100 °C dry heat treatment does not significantly impact the fit or the material of the N95 respirators. Notably, the Bacou Willson 801 respirators failed quantitative fit testing of a single subject under all conditions, despite being a NIOSH approved N95 FFR. These respirators may fit another user better, thus potentially yielding passing fit test scores. These results emphasize the importance to conduct individual fit tests after decontamination procedures as typically required in a health care setting. By comparison, all autoclaved respirators failed fit testing, despite having minimal changes in the material quality. Autoclaved masks failed the mask fit test and suggested that the change in filtration efficiency is up to 7.73%. However, the mask material analysis does not corroborate significant changes in the filtration material that could lead to these decreases in filtration efficiency. This points to the fact, that most likely, autoclaving the respirators led to changes in the mask fit by either altering the face mask mold, sealant, and/or straps. Taken together, these data suggest that autoclaving indeed has an impact on the fit of the respirator material. In combination with previous studies on the effects of autoclaving N95 respirators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and their deleterious impact on both fit and filtration, the results confirm that autoclaving is not a consistently viable method for the decontamination of N95 respirators for their reuse.</p>
<p id="P38">Although we assessed the function of decontaminated masks by quantitative fit testing and material characterization, our study does not directly distinguish whether failed fit testing is due to the impairment of the filtration efficiency, including any impact on the electret properties of N95 respirators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), or due to the failure of fit or some combination of both fit and filtration, although our data suggests that impact on fit as the most likely cause. In summary, dry heat sterilization is a potentially scalable, accessible, and effective method of decontaminating N95 respirators for up to 4 cycles in times of crisis and PPE shortages.</p>
