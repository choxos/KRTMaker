We set out to reconstitute the pathway for strictosidine, a key intermediate of all MIAs, from central metabolism in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. A disadvantage of this host is that its rich background metabolism results in the derivatization of some heterologously produced molecules. We used transcriptomic analysis to identify glycosyltransferases that were upregulated in response to biosynthetic intermediates and produced plant lines with targeted mutations in the genes encoding them. Expression of the early MIA pathway in these lines produced a more favorable product profile. Strictosidine biosynthesis was successfully reconstituted, with the best yields obtained by the co-expression of 14 enzymes, of which a major latex protein-like enzyme (MLPL) from Nepeta (catmint) was critical for improving flux through the iridoid pathway. The removal of endogenous glycosyltransferases did not impact the yields of strictosidine, highlighting that the metabolic flux of the pathway enzymes to a stable biosynthetic intermediate minimizes the need to engineer the endogenous metabolism of the host.

A relative of tobacco, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> has emerged as a favored species for plant-based production of pharmaceutical proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> and metabolic pathway reconstitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Successes include gram-scale production of triterpenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and milligram scale production of etoposides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, several studies have reported the accumulation of unintended side products, presumably produced by the off-target activities of endogenous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> enzymes such as oxidases and glycosylases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Although the activity of endogenous enzymes has been exploited in some studies to produce novel molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> or to compensate for the lack of a known enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, derivatization of molecules for the most part is a disadvantage, reducing the potential purity and yield of the target compound.</p><p id="P4">Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a large group of plant-produced natural products of which over 3000 have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This class of molecules includes many medicinally valuable compounds used to treat addiction, heart conditions, dementia, pain, cancer, malaria, and diabetes. The best characterized MIA-producing plant is <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (Madagascar periwinkle), which makes over 130 MIAs including the bioactive vinblastine and vincristine, which are used as chemotherapies. However, these valuable molecules are present in low concentrations in <italic>C. roseus</italic> (0.0005% dry weight)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which limits their availability. Mass cultivation of <italic>C. roseus</italic> cells is feasible, but a cell line that consistently produces these anti-cancer molecules has yet to be reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although methods for transient expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and stable genetic transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> of <italic>C. roseus</italic> plants have been reported, genetically engineering the native plant host to increase yields of these compounds remains technically difficult. Furthermore, the structural complexity of many MIAs means chemical synthesis is often challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Consequently, alternate routes for production are desirable and the recent discovery of missing steps in the vinblastine pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> makes pathway reconstruction in a heterologous host an increasingly attractive option.</p><p id="P5">Achieving the production of therapeutically useful amounts of MIAs requires pathway engineering to maximize metabolic flux through the early parts of the pathway. Strictosidine is the last common biosynthetic intermediate from which all 3000+ known MIAs derive. Reconstitution of its ~11 step biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms can require extensive tuning of enzyme expression conditions and strain optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>; for example, poor expression of geraniol 8-hydroxylase (G8H) has hampered strictosidine production in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Obtaining useful yields of molecules such as vinblastine, which would require the expression of a further 16+ enzymes beyond strictosidine, is likely to require significant metabolic engineering effort, though yeast has recently been engineered to produce ajmalicine via the genomic integration of 29 expression cassettes, demonstrating the potential for heterologous reconstruction of plant natural product biosynthetic pathways effort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">While yeast remains a promising host for heterologous expression of metabolic pathways, plant-derived proteins frequently require less optimization and engineering for successful expression in a plant host. Expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> was used by Miettinen and co-workers to reconstitute the <italic>C. roseus</italic> iridoid pathway, enabling elucidation of the remaining four missing steps of the pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, they encountered a metabolic bottleneck midway through the 13-step pathway requiring reconstitution in two phases with the latter part requiring the provision of an intermediate substrate (iridotrial) in order to obtain strictosidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, the rich endogenous metabolism of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> acted on the early, hydrophobicintermediates of strictosidine biosynthesis to produce a variety of derivatized, “dead-end” products.</p><p id="P7">Here we successfully engineer <italic>de novo</italic> production of strictosidine in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. We identify endogenous glycosyltransferases that derivatize early pathway intermediates and demonstrate that fewer derivatives accumulate in plant lines with loss-of-function-mutations in the genes encoding these enzymes. We utilize additional genes that enhance the production of nepetalactol and enable high levels of strictosidine to be produced from the central metabolism <italic>of N. benthamiana</italic> without the need for supplementation of any metabolite precursors or intermediates.

We also found that as the pathway is extended by the co-expression of additional enzymes that fewer derivative peaks are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This suggests that the pathway enzymes have high affinity for the substrates and, particularly when expressed from strong promoters, are very likely able to outcompete endogenous enzymes for substrates. Strictosidine is a polar, glycosylated molecule that is likely sequestered in the vacuole for storage and is less prone to derivatization than its hydrophobic iridoid precursors. Indeed, when the pathway for strictosidine was expressed in lines that produced fewer derivatives or early pathway intermediates, there was no significant change in yield compared to expression in wild type <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>).</p><p id="P33">We were able to demonstrate the production of high quantities of strictosidine (0.23 ± 0.11 mg/g DW) from central metabolism in a photosynthetic organism. We also enhanced the production of strictosidine by improving the key cyclization step required for formation of nepetalactol. The plant genus <italic>Nepeta</italic> L., colloquially known as catnip or catmint, uses the early part of the secoiridoid pathway to produce nepetalactones. Recent work revealed that production of <italic>cistrans</italic> nepetalactol is assisted by MLPL in <italic>Nepeta</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. The heterologous expression of MLPL from <italic>N. mussinii</italic> to assist with cyclization of the reactive enol product of ISY overcame bottlenecks in the secoiridoid pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and was critical for enabling heterologous production of strictosidine in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). MLPL similarly enhances secoiridoid metabolic engineering in microorganisms such as yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, a cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> one-pot enzyme cascade included MLPL with nine other pathway enzymes, accessory proteins, and cofactor regeneration enzymes to produce ~1 g/L nepetalactone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">The MIA pathway in <italic>C. roseus</italic> is highly compartmentalized across subcellular compartments and cell types. The first committed step is geraniol synthesis (GES), which is localized to the chloroplast of internal phloem-associated parenchyma (IPAP) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. To increase substrate availability for GES, we co-expressed GPPS from <italic>P. abies</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> which was also utilized by Miettinen and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Expression of chloroplast-targeted PaGPPS improved yield ~5 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) consistent with previously reported effects on the production of geraniol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Of note, PaGPPS is nearly identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>) to a GPPS from <italic>Picea glauca</italic> shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to produce higher levels of the monoterpene limonene relative to six other GPPS sequences commonly used in terpene metabolic engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. We also co-expressed DXS from <italic>C. roseus.</italic> Interestingly, CrDXS had relatively little effect on the yield of strictosidine in contrast to previously reported effects of DXS on the production of diterpenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">Recent efforts to engineer metabolic pathways have found benefits in altering the compartmentalization of pathway enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. For example, the pathway to produce the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin was relocated to the chloroplast of <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> where ferredoxin, reduced via the photosynthetic electron transport chain, can serve as an efficient electron donor to the two cytochromeP450s (CYPs) within the pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Additionally, the localization of enzymes encoding the late steps of the artemisinin pathway to the chloroplast in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> produced higher levels of artemisinin (800 µg/g DW)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> and artemisinic acid (~1200 µg/g DW)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> compared to localization within the cytosol (6.8 µg/g DW artemisinin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. This increase is possibly due to the isolation of metabolites from the cytosol where they may both impact viability and be exposed to unwanted derivatization by endogenous glycosyltransferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Production of halogenated indican<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> and vanillin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> also benefited from chloroplast localization. In contrast, a recent report found that production of diterpenoids (typically synthesized in the chloroplast) was dramatically enhanced by co-opting the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to produce GGPP rather than the chloroplast MEP pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">In this study, we found that the optimal configuration for reconstructing the pathway to strictosidine within <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves is to match the <italic>C. roseus</italic> localization pattern that utilizes the chloroplast MEP pathway for isoprenoid precursors to produce geraniol and then localizing the remaining pathway enzymes in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We hypothesize that monoterpene production in the cytosol is limited since GPP (10 carbons) produced by GPPS is also the substrate for the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which produces farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) (15 carbons). Supporting this hypothesis is data suggesting that all four copies of NbFPPS are upregulated to produce sesquiterpenoid phytosterols and phytoalexins in response to <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup><italic>. A. tumefaciens</italic> also elicits widespread transcriptional remodeling when infiltrated into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. This competition between GES and FPPS might also explain the higher levels of geraniol and geraniol derivatives in the plastid reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Future efforts to conditionally inactivate NbFPPS during heterologous production might enable a metabolic engineering strategy that could take advantage of both the plastid and cytosolic route to geraniol production.</p><p id="P37">In <italic>C. roseus</italic>, geraniol diffuses or is transported from the plastid into the cytosol to react with G8H, which is tethered to the exterior of the ER membrane. The next steps (G8H to deoxyloganic acid hydroxylase (7-DLH)) are active in the cytosol of IPAP cells with two CYPs (G8H and IO) also anchored to the ER membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Loganic acid is then transported by NPF2.4/5/6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> to epidermal cells where four more enzymes (LAMT to strictosidine synthase (STR)) produce strictosidine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>. Tryptamine and secologanin are imported into the vacuole, where strictosidine is synthesized and accumulated with export of strictosidine mediated by the transporter NPF2.9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. Thus, four pathway CYPs (G8H, IO, 7-DLH and secologanin synthase (SLS)) are likely interfacing with endogenous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> CYP reductases for electron transfer of NADPH to the CYPs. It is possible that the necessary CYP reductases are less abundant in the chloroplast and thus limit the accumulation of strictosidine in this compartment. It is also possible that the CYP450s are improperly membrane anchored or that higher stromal pH of the chloroplast (~8.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> inhibits enzyme activity compared to the cytosol (pH ~7.0). We also considered the lack of an additional cofactor for LAMT, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to explain the low levels of strictosidine production (relative to 7-DLA) in the chloroplast. However, this small molecule is known to be actively transported into the plastid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup> and is an essential substrate for ChlM (Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase) involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis within the chloroplast.</p><p id="P38">The production of strictosidine <italic>in planta</italic> opens up new avenues to produce a wealth of MIA products using biological synthesis. Although the endogenous metabolism of this species is detrimental to the accumulation of monoterpenes, it enables accumulation of complex molecules. Particularly as new biosynthesis pathways for additional MIAs are discovered (e.g. the anti-addictive compound ibogaine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>, the antimalarial quinine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>), the possibility of coupling this work in a plug-and-play manner with downstream biosynthesis modules is an exciting prospect for natural product synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS145266-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d22aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Benjamin Lichman for guidance on working with MLPL.
