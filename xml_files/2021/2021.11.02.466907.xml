Methods to study epigenetic heterogeneity are limited in throughput and information obtained per cell. Here, we adapted Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) to analyze a wide panel of histone modifications in primary tumor-derived lines of Diffused Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). DIPG is a lethal glioma, driven by histone H3 lysine 27 mutation (H3-K27M). We identified two epigenetically distinct subpopulations in DIGP, reflecting inherent heterogeneity in expression of the mutant histone. These two subpopulations are robust across tumor lines derived from different patients and show differential proliferation capacity and expression of stem-cell and differentiation markers. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of this high-dimensional data to elucidate potential interactions between histone modifications and epigenetic alterations during the cell-cycle. Our work establishes new concepts for the analysis of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer that could be applied to diverse biological systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Epigenetic regulation of genome function is fundamental for cellular differentiation, and its deregulation often promotes cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Flavahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Valencia and Kadoch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhao and Shilatifard, 2019</xref>). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones, which compose the nucleosome structure, regulate transcription by mediating interactions with the transcriptional machinery and by physically affecting DNA accessibility. In the last decade, single-cell RNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of transcriptional heterogeneity within normal and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baslan and Hicks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Suvà and Tirosh, 2019</xref>). Parallel techniques were developed to explore epigenetic cellular heterogeneity, mainly focusing on single-cell DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cusanovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kelsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shema et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smallwood et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, histone PTMs are mainly analyzed by bulk methods such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). Recently, single-cell ChIP-seq and Cut&amp;Tag revealed the patterns of several histone PTMs in the mouse brain, during stem cell differentiation, and in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bartosovic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grosselin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rotem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Advances in optical microscopy and super-resolution imaging allowed single-cell spatial analysis of histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boettiger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Woodworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). While these advances show great promise, they are limited in scale and throughput, allowing analysis of one or two modifications at a time per single cell. Recently, a single-cell approach based on CyTOF, was used to study the epigenome of blood immune cells, demonstrating epigenetic alterations occurring with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cheung et al., 2018</xref>), and following vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wimmers et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Mutations in epigenetic regulators and histone proteins are frequent in many types of cancer. One example is the lysine 27-to-methionine mutation of histone H3 (H3-K27M), which is the driving event for DIPG, a lethal pediatric cancer. More than 80% of DIPG cases show a H3-K27M mutation on one allele out of 32 that encode canonical histone H3.1 or the histone variant H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Filbin and Monje, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nacev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). This gain-of-function mutation was shown to cause drastic alterations in the epigenome, in both cis (on the mutant histones themselves) and <italic>trans</italic> (epigenetic alterations to wild-type histones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Furth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zhang and Zhang, 2019</xref>). The most notable changes induced by H3-K27M are the global loss of the repressive modification tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), with concomitant gain in acetylation of that same residue (H3K27ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we propose a novel adaptation of CyTOF, with a unique custom-designed epigenetic panel, as a method to reveal epigenetic dynamics and heterogeneity in cancer. We demonstrate the power of this method in revealing: (1) Systematic effects of chromatin perturbations, such as the H3-K27M mutation in glioma; (2) Discovery of epigenetic heterogeneity within tumor lines, as exemplified by two distinct subpopulations in DIPG; (3) Identification of baseline correlations between chromatin modifications, suggesting mechanisms of co-regulation; and (4) Characterization of dynamic epigenetic processes in single cells. This high-dimensional single-cell data is instrumental in deducing principles of epigenetic heterogeneity and regulation in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CyTOF Epi-Panel reveals global epigenetic alterations induced by the K27M-mutant histone</title><p id="P6">To explore CyTOF as a method to reveal systematic effects of chromatin perturbations in cancer, we examined glioma models expressing the mutant histone H3.3-K27M. We designed an epigenetics-oriented panel, containing antibodies targeting the H3-K27M histone mutant, 18 well-characterized histone modifications, 5 histones proteins (H1, H1.0, H3, H3.3 and H4) and 3 chromatin regulators. We extended this panel with oncogenic, cancer stem cell and glioma lineage markers, as well as cell-cycle specific indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each selected antibody was conjugated to a metal, taking into consideration several parameters in metal allocation to enable parallel reading of all the antibodies in the same cells and minimize technical noise (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Antibodies specificity was verified by introducing functional perturbations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We first applied this epigenetic panel to an isogenic system of HEK293 cells with inducible expression of either wild type (WT) histone H3.3 or the H3.3-K27M-mutant. To minimize batch effect, samples were first barcoded so that subsequent processing and CyTOF runs could be done simultaneously. CyTOF experiments on three biological repeats showed very high reproducibility between experiments, validating the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E-F</xref>). We obtained single-cell measurements from 72,316 and 76,695 cells expressing the WT or K27M-mutant histone, respectively. Each measurement of histone modification was normalized to the level of core histones H3, H4, and H3.3 in that cell (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), followed by dimension reduction Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, HEK293 cells expressing the mutant H3.3 clustered separately from cells expressing the WT histone, using solely histone modifications for this algorithm and excluding the H3-K27M measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that expression of H3-K27M results in global epigenetic alterations. Of note, we did detect a small fraction of the H3-K27M mutant cells that clustered with WT cells and indeed failed to express the H3-K27M construct, and were thus removed from further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The most prominent epigenetic alterations induced by expression of H3-K27M were the global loss of H3K27me3 and gain in H3K27ac, as is well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). In addition to these known effects, the extended panel revealed alterations in many other epigenetic modifications, associated with both active and repressed chromatin. Concomitant with the increase in H3K27ac, we observed a marked increase in lysine 16 acetylation on histone H4 (H4K16ac). The data also revealed a global increase in the activating marks mono- and tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me1, H3K4me3) as well as lysine 9 and 64 acetylations (H3K64ac, H3K9ac), albeit at a lower magnitude. These alterations suggest a more ‘open’ chromatin state induced by the H3-K27M mutation. However, there was also a parallel increase in the heterochromatin-associated mark tri-methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), as was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Harutyunyan et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we observed a reduction in the mitosis-associated phosphorylation of histone H3 (pH3S28), and a mild reduction in cleaved H3, a proteolytic form of histone H3 linked with mammalian differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duncan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results were highly reproducible across independent experiments with different H3-K27M induction times (4, 7 and 10 days) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>), pointing to the robustness of the epigenetic alterations and the quantitative nature of CyTOF in revealing systematic effects mediated by this mutation.</p><p id="P9">The global increase in histone acetylations, suggesting a general opening of chromatin structure, motivated us to explore the shape of nuclei in cells expressing the mutant histone. Interestingly, we observed that HEK293 cells expressing H3-K27M had significantly larger nuclei than isogenic cells expressing WT H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). To examine whether the increase in nuclei size is indeed mediated by histone acetylations, we treated WT HEK293 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (HDACi) for 72 hours. HDACi treatment led to an increase in nuclei size similar to that observed upon H3-K27M induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>). These results suggest that H3-K27M expression results in elevated histone acetylations, presumably leading to a more ‘open’ chromatin structure and enlarged nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Single-cell profiling identifies epigenetic heterogeneity in H3-K27M tumor-derived primary cell lines</title><p id="P10">To examine H3-K27M-associated epigenetic alterations in a more biologically relevant system, we applied our CyTOF Epi-Panel to study two patient-derived DIPG cultures: SU-DIPG13, expressing the H3-K27M mutation endogenously, and SU-DIPG48, harboring WT H3. As expected, UMAP analysis of these lines, based solely on epigenetic marks, resulted in separate clustering of each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). H3-K27M expression was restricted to SU-DIPG13 cells, which also showed the expected low levels of H3K27me3 and high H3K27ac. Interestingly, while SU-DIPG48 cells clustered to a single center, SU-DIPG13 showed a clear division into two distinct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). We repeated the UMAP analysis for SU-DIPG13 cells alone, and trained a gradient boosting algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen and Guestrin, 2016</xref>) to determine the epigenetic features that affect assignment to the two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C-E</xref>). The results showed these two clusters mainly originated from higher expression of the H3-K27M mutant histone, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 pushing the cells towards one cluster, while increased levels of H3K9me3, cleaved H3 and pH3S28 pushed cells towards the second cluster. In fact, the algorithm allocated single cells into the correct cluster at 91% percent accuracy using reads from only four modifications: H3K27ac, cleaved H3, H3K9me3 and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Intriguingly, although DIPG cells all contain the H3-K27M mutation endogenously, the expression of the mutant gene varied in the population. This variability in H3-K27M expression likely induces epigenetic heterogeneity, generating the two distinct epigenetic subpopulations we termed H3-K27M-low and H3-K27M-high.</p><p id="P11">To characterize this epigenetic heterogeneity, we examined fold change differences of all chromatin marks in these two subpopulations. Similar to the trends observed in the HEK293 system, the H3-K27M-high cluster showed elevation of all active modifications, mainly H3K27ac, H4K16ac and H3K4me1/3, and reduced levels of cleaved H3 and pH3S28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2F</xref>). Interestingly, the H3-K27M-low cluster showed higher levels of the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, which was upregulated by H3-K27M in the HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results support a complex regulation of this modification by H3-K27M: while the mutant histone induces an overall increase in this mark compared to WT H3.3 cells, it seems that lower expression of H3-K27M leads to higher H3K9me3 levels versus H3K9me3 levels in cells expressing high-H3-K27M. These results led us to explore the regulation of this modification by H3-K27M in a dynamic setup, as described below. Finally, we also applied our CyTOF panel to analyze two isogenic DIPG cell lines, where the H3.1 or H3.3-K27M alleles were knocked-out using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Krug et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the results in the HEK293 isogenic system, loss of the mutant histone ‘rescued’ the most prominent epigenetic effects, reducing histone acetylations and increasing H3K27me3 and pH3S28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CyTOF reveals dynamic epigenetic alterations mediated by H3-K27M, suggesting distinct modes of regulation</title><p id="P12">To explore the dynamics of epigenetic alterations mediated by H3-K27M, we induced expression of the mutant histone in the HEK293 cells for 8, 16, 48 and 96 hours, followed by CyTOF with a focused panel of six epigenetic marks and H3-K27M. We observed a gradual increase in the levels of H3-K27M expression, reaching saturation at 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>). A highly coordinated behavior was seen for H3K27ac, H4K16ac and H3K36me2. H3K27me3 levels, however, were not affected at the short induction, and started to decrease gradually only at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is in line with the high stability of this modification, which is thought to be mainly ‘diluted’ during cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alabert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rice and Allis, 2001</xref>). These results raise the intriguing possibility that the increase in histone acetylations occur prior to the loss of H3K27me3, and thus may be independent of H3K27me3 depletion. Alternatively, local loss of H3K27me3 might be sufficient to induce the acetylation phenotype, or alterations in other modifications not included in the panel.</p><p id="P13">While most of the epigenetic marks showed a gradual unidirectional change (increase or decrease) over H3-K27M induction, for H3K9me3 and cleaved H3 we detected a complex non-monotonic behavior. At early time points, corresponding to low or moderate expression of H3-K27M, H3K9me3 and cleaved H3 expression spiked. At later time points, in which the expression of H3-K27M increased, H3K9me3 and cleaved H3 levels dropped, followed by a gradual, milder elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). At each of these points, H3K9me3 levels were higher than prior to induction, suggesting a general positive effect of H3-K27M on H3K9me3 levels. This result aligns with our data in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1C</xref>) and the SU-DIPG36 isogenic system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Interestingly, the highest levels of H3K9me3 and cleaved H3 were detected in the presence of moderate, rather than high, expression of the mutant histone, in line with our observations that in SU-DIPG13, the subpopulation of H3-K27M-low cells contained higher levels of these marks compared to H3-K27M-high cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). To examine this phenomenon in a more biologically relevant background, we established a similar system of inducible H3.3-K27M expression in the DIPG cells SJ-HGGX39, which contain WT H3.3. To expand our observations, we included antibodies targeting the di-methylations of H3 Lys9 and Lys27 (H3K9me2 and H3K27me2). Similar to the results in HEK293, expression of H3-K27M in these DIPG cells induced a gradual increase in H3K27ac, observed as early as eight hours following induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3C-D</xref>). Of note, both the H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 modifications showed highly similar dynamics, decreasing only at later time points. Strikingly, the same non-monotonic behavior described above for H3K9me3 and cleaved H3 was seen also in these DIPG cells, with moderate rather than high H3-K27M expression associated with higher levels of these epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, H3K9me2 and H3K36me2 showed highly similar trends. While the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 Lys9 shared a similar dynamic behavior, the overall levels of H3K9me2, as opposed to H3K9me3, decreased following H3-K27M expression. This result is in agreement with the DIPG isogenic systems, showing higher levels of H3K9me2 in cells knocked-out for the mutant histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Altogether, the data supports a complex relationship between H3-K27M expression and the histone modifications H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K36me2 and cleaved H3, which are highly dependent on the relative levels of H3-K27M expression. Moreover, these results provide further evidence for the importance of these epigenetic marks in dictating the two distinct epigenetic subpopulations in SU-DIPG13.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The two epigenetic subpopulations are robust across different DIPG tumor-derived lines</title><p id="P14">Our findings of epigenetic heterogeneity in SU-DIPG13 prompted us to explore whether this phenomenon was unique to that cell line, or if it could be generalized to additional DIPG tumor-derived lines. To that end, we performed CyTOF in primary cell lines derived from three additional patients with H3-K27M mutation: SU-DIPG6, SU-DIPG25 and SU-DIPG38, as well as the WT H3 DIPG line discussed above, SJ-HGGX39. We also repeated the CyTOF for SU-DIPG13, aiming to examine more cells as well as expand our panel of antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). UMAP analysis showed that all four H3-K27M DIPG cell lines presented two epigenetic clusters, although the proportion of cells in the H3-K27M-low cluster varied between cell lines and between experimental repeats of the same cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, a shared UMAP of two mutant lines showed they clustered together, indicating a highly similar epigenetic behavior, unlike SU-DIPG48 and SJ-HGGX39 expressing WT H3, which clustered separately from the mutant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Reproducing the previous CyTOF experiment on SU-DIPG13, in all mutant DIPG lines the H3-K27M-low cluster had higher mean levels of cleaved H3 and cells expressing pH3S28, as well as H3K9me2. The H3-K27M-high cluster was characterized by higher levels of H3K27ac, H4K16ac and H4K4me1/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A-E</xref>). Overall, the epigenetic landscape of the two clusters was highly conserved and robust between the different cell lines and biological repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). The two epigenetic subpopulations were seen at all phases of the cell cycle, and thus do not reflect differences in cell-cycle stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4F-I</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed an increase in EZH2, the catalytic unit of PRC2, in the H3-K27M-high cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4J</xref>). This result may reflect a feedback mechanism to the loss of H3K27me3, which needs to be further investigated.</p><p id="P15">To explore the causal effects of H3-K27M levels on the existence and proportion of cells in the two epigenetic subpopulations, we genetically manipulated SU-DIPG13 cells to express an inducible exogenous H3-K27M construct on top of its endogenous H3-K27M mutation. Following five days of H3-K27M induction, we detected a significant reduction in the fraction of cells consisting in the H3-K27M-low cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Moreover, UMAP analysis revealed that the two epigenetic clusters were closer to each other in the H3-K27M-induced cells compared to the control SU-DIPG13, suggesting a higher degree of similarity in their epigenetic landscape. Next, we knocked down the endogenous mutant histone in SU-DIPG13 cells by infecting them with shRNA targeting the H3F3A gene that carries the K27M mutation (shK27M), or control shRNA targeting the H3F3B WT gene of H3.3 (shControl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Silveira et al., 2019</xref>). UMAP analysis of shControl cells was done in order to define the H3-K27M-high and H3-K27M-low clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4K-L</xref>). Strikingly, a joint UMAP analysis of both the control and H3-K27M-depleted cells revealed three distinct areas that varied in their H3-K27M expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Cluster 1 corresponded to the H3-K27M-high subpopulation; while 84% of the shControl cells were allocated to this cluster, only 7% of the shK27M cells were associated with this area. Most of the shK27M cells (85.5%) showed strong depletion of the mutant histone and clustered separately from the H3-K27M-high and H3-K27M-low cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>, cluster 3). Interestingly, we identified 7.5% of the shK27M cells that expressed intermediate levels of H3-K27M, and clustered with the shControl H3-K27M-low cluster. This data indicates that in the shRNA system, H3-K27M-low cells expressed intermediate levels of the mutant histone, compared to the majority of shK27M cells that showed robust depletion of H3-K27M (thus showing greater similarity to H3-K27M knock-out cells). These intermediate H3-K27M levels generated a distinct epigenetic landscape, which was different from H3-K27M-high cells or cells completely depleted from the mutant histone, as evident from the UMAP analysis. Taken together, these results support a causal role for H3-K27M expression levels in dictating the two epigenetic subpopulations in DIPG patient derived cultures.</p><p id="P16">Finally, we aimed to examine whether this heterogeneity in H3-K27M expression could be detected in-vivo in mouse models and in patients diagnosed with H3-K27M gliomas. Thus, we established a DIPG orthotopic xenograft model by injections of SU-DIPG6 cells expressing GFP into the pons of immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grasso et al., 2015</xref>). H3-K27M immunofluorescence showed clear and robust heterogeneity in H3-K27M expression between tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). To better characterize this heterogeneity, we calculated the median intensity values of H3-K27M in 340-660 GFP-positive cells in the brains of each of three mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4M-N</xref>). The histogram showed a broad distribution of intensity values, comparable to H3-K27M levels measured in the CyTOF experiments. Interestingly, while in the mouse brain the majority of cells seemed to have low H3-K27M expression, in the CyTOF experiment performed on cultured cells, we observed larger fraction of cells expressing high-H3-K27M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4M</xref>). These results may reflect differences in the microenvironment between cells grown in culture versus in-vivo growth in the brain. Importantly, immunohistochemical staining of H3-K27M in postmortem autopsy samples from three human patients also revealed intra-tumor H3-K27M heterogeneity in all specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4O</xref>).

In addition, we examined markers for the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the mesenchymal-like cells (MES-like) CD24 and CD44, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we found enrichment of CD24+ cells in the H3-K27M-high cluster compared to the H3-K27M-low cluster, and an opposite trend was observed for CD44+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). We also detected a mild increase in the levels of the oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPC) marker PDGFRa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>).

The elevated levels of SOX2, c-Myc, PDGFRa and CD24 in cells expressing high levels of H3-K27M, in addition to the reduced expression of H1.0 and cleaved H3, suggest that cells belonging to the H3-K27M-high cluster represent the fraction of tumor cells that had higher self-renewal, stem-cell-like properties.</p><p id="P19">To examine the proliferation capacity of the two subpopulations, we included in our CyTOF panel the proliferation marker Ki-67.

Of note, despite reduced Ki-67 in the H3-K27M-low cells, a higher fraction of these cells were positive for the mitosis-associated pH3S28, perhaps indicating prolonged unproductive mitosis (pH3S28, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). Interestingly, the single-cell analysis revealed H3-K27M-mediated dependency between Ki-67 and oncogenic c-Myc, as the correlation between these two markers increased significantly in the H3-K27M-high cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5D</xref>). These results support the notion that the less differentiated H3-K27M-high cells are more proliferative. Moreover, inclusion of cell-cycle indicators in the experiment revealed that while &gt;98% of cells were actively cycling, the small fraction of cells that were found to be in G0 state (315 out of 18,977 cells in SU-DIPG25, and 167 out of 25,336 cells in SU-DIPG13) were exclusively allocated to the H3-K27M-low cluster. These results are in line with a recent single-cell RNA-seq study of DIPG tumors, showing that the majority of tumor cells are indeed less differentiated, and these are the cells with the higher proliferation capacity that presumably maintain the tumor’s aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Filbin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To gain a better understanding of the differential transcription profiles of these two epigenetic subpopulations, we FACS-sorted SU-DIPG25 cells based on their expression levels of H3-K27M relative to H3, followed by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-I</xref>). Differentially expressed genes in the H3-K27M-high and H3-K27M-low cells showed significant overlap with recently published gene signatures of DIPG xenograft cells expressing H3-K27M, versus cells depleted for the mutant histone by shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Silveira et al., 2019</xref>). Among these genes that were both upregulated in H3-K27M-high cells and included in the published signature, were genes known to promote high proliferation and stemness, such as MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>), ID4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jeon et al., 2008</xref>), HEY-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brun et al., 2018</xref>), VGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and ITGA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Ying et al., 2014</xref>). The gene NID-1, whose expression levels correlated with shorter survival rates for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), was also elevated in H3-K27M-high cells. Finally, H3-K27M-low cells expressed higher levels of the tumor-suppressor gene CDKN2A (p16). Taken together, this analysis provides further support to the high proliferative state observed for H3-K27M-high cells. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase SIRT-2 was upregulated in the H3-K27M-low cells, perhaps contributing to the reduced levels of histone acetylations in this subpopulation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Single-cell CyTOF analysis uncovers potential co-regulation of histone modifications</title><p id="P21">We next aimed to explore whether the CyTOF single-cell multi-parametric data can be leveraged to study baseline correlations between histone modifications. Our underlying assumption is that histone modifications that are mechanistically linked (for example, deposited or removed by the same enzymes) should be highly correlated at the single-cell level. As we have measurements of multiple repressive and active modifications within the same cells, we might be able to deduce potential interactions between different epigenetic marks. We first calculated the pairwise correlations between all pairs of histone modifications associated with gene activation: H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K64ac, H4K16ac, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1. In both HEK293 cells and SU-DIPG48, expressing WT H3.3, H3 acetylations on lysine 9, 27 and 64 clustered with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A-B</xref>). This result aligns with our hypothesis, as these modifications are known to be deposited by similar enzymatic complexes (EP300/CREBBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Di Cerbo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>)). Of note, H4K16ac, which is deposited by the distinct acetyltransferase Males absent On the First (MOF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), showed lower correlation and did not cluster with H3 acetylations, further supporting our hypothesis. Interestingly, we also observed a high correlation between H4K16ac and the H3K4me1 in both lines, and in HEK293 cells these modifications also correlated highly with H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>). In HeLa cells, MOF was shown to form a stable complex with MLL1, and the purified complex had robust methyltransferase activity in depositing H3K4me1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dou et al., 2005</xref>). The high correlation between these modifications suggests this complex may be active in diverse cellular systems, generating synchronized deposition of these histone marks. In addition, recent work identified the PHD finger domain of MLL4, the major methyltransferase that deposits H3K4me1, as a specific reader of H4K16ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We next examined the correlations of repressive modifications with each other and with active chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The histone modifications H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, known to mark facultative heterochromatin, were highly correlated with each other, while H3K9me3, the hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin, showed significantly lower correlation with both of these marks. These observations are in line with the different genomic distributions of these modifications measured by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>) and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>). Interestingly, H3K9me2, but not H3K9me3, was highly correlated with the intergenic mark H3K36me2, perhaps reflecting their enrichment in similar genomic regions and the exclusion of H3K9me3 from H3K36me2 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Shirane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Weinberg et al., 2019</xref>). To examine whether the cell-cycle phase affects the correlations between the various histone marks, we repeated the correlation analysis for the sets of active and repressive modifications in cells found only at G1 or S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D-G</xref>). While the repressive modifications showed similar clustering along the cell cycle, the active H4K16ac modification clustered with H3 acetylations during G1, yet in S phase it showed higher correlation with H3K4me3 and H3K4me1. This shift may imply a distinct regulation of H4K16ac during S phase. These results point to the potential of single-cell correlation analysis for uncovering co-regulation between epigenetic modifications.</p><p id="P23">To explore how epigenetic perturbations affect these patterns, we analyzed HEK293 cells expressing H3-K27M. We observed a general increase in all correlations between open chromatin marks in H3-K27M cells, in line with the global opening of the chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). The most prominent increase in correlation was observed between H3K27ac and H4K16ac, the two modifications that were most upregulated by H3-K27M. To further generalize these observations, we explored pairwise correlations in SU-DIPG13, SU-DIPG25 and SU-DIPG6 tumor lines endogenously expressing H3-K27M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">6SH</xref>). Similar to HEK293 cells expressing H3-K27M, in SU-DIPG13 and SU-DIPG25 cells H4K16ac clustered with H3K27ac, and not with H3K4me1 as in cells not expressing the mutant histone. This result reflects the epigenetic alterations caused by H3-K27M, coupling these two acetylations on histone H3 and H4.</p><p id="P24">To further explore the concept of histone PTMs crosstalk and provide additional validation to the correlations identified in single cells, we implemented a drug perturbation approach. We treated the SU-DIPG13 cells with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, reported to have therapeutic potential for DIPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grasso et al., 2015</xref>), for several time points. This allowed us to calculate the trajectory of change for each modification, and examine the correlations between the trajectories of all modifications. Modifications that showed a similar trajectory of change in response to Vorinostat were clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H-I</xref>). Interestingly, pairs of modifications that were highly correlated at the single-cell level also showed a similar behavior upon Vorinostat treatment. These results provide additional support for a shared regulation of these modifications, and highlight the use of CyTOF data to deduce both baseline correlations between histone marks, as well as gain insights on how epigenetic perturbations affect various epigenetic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Leveraging single-cell data to analyze dynamic chromatin alterations during the cell cycle</title><p id="P25">To further explore the utility of CyTOF in revealing dynamic processes, we aimed to leverage this data to more broadly identify global epigenetic alterations associated with different phases of the cell cycle. Thus, we combined our epigenetic CyTOF panel with the Maxpar cell cycle panel kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), allowing us to define the cell cycle phase of each cell in the population. Analysis of the raw amounts of core histones revealed an increase in H3 and H4 levels when cells transitioned from G1 to S phase, in line with the expression of histone genes during DNA synthesis to enable formation of nucleosomes on the nascent DNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7A</xref>). Accordingly, H3 and H4 levels further increased in G2 cells that contain double the amount of DNA, and dropped upon cell division (M-phase). To gain a robust view of the epigenetic changes associated with the cell cycle, we analyzed four different cell lines, including two lines that express H3-K27M. Across all these lines, we found that the chromatin in S-phase seems to be in a more ‘open’ state: it was enriched with active marks such as H3 acetylations, and showed reduced levels of the repressive H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7B-C</xref>). Interestingly, H4K16ac decreased during S phase, emphasizing the distinct regulation of H3 and H4 acetylations, as also indicated by their lower correlation during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7B-C, S6D-E</xref>). In contrast to the previously shown pattern of a global increase in histone methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kheir and Lund, 2010</xref>), we observed a decrease in most methylations examined, including the transcription-associated mark H3K36me3. Unlike most methylations, H3K4me3 levels increased during S-phase, in agreement with the open chromatin state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7B-C</xref>). Of note, the elevation in histone acetylations during S-phase was milder in cells expressing H3-K27M, likely reflecting the high baseline levels of open chromatin marks in these cells. Finally, we also detected epigenetic alterations specific to mitosis, such as a significant elevation in γH2A.X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>), a modification which is integral to the DNA damage response, and was previously shown to have an independent role during M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ichijima et al., 2005</xref>)</p><p id="P26">Next, we leveraged our data to explore the epigenetic alterations that occur with time during S-phase. We used iridium labeling that marks total DNA content to divide the S-phase population accordingly: cells with high iridium are at a late stage of DNA synthesis, while cells with low iridium are in early S-phase. Similar to the increase observed in H3 and H4 levels between G1, S and G2 cells, we detected an increase in the levels of these core histones in late versus early DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). To explore the pattern of histone modifications along S-phase, we normalized their levels to the core histones H3 and H4, to account for the total increase in histones expression. As expected, almost all histone modifications showed decreased levels in late S-phase, compatible with the dilution of the parental modified histones and incorporation of new histones that are not yet modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7D</xref>). Interestingly, the repressive histone modifications H3K27me3, H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 showed slower restoration in comparison to the active modifications H3K4me3, H3K64ac and H3K9ac. H3K9me3 levels, which were reported to be restored slowly and fully just by the next G1 cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alabert et al., 2015</xref>), indeed showed a prominent decrease in late S-phase in all five cell lines examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7D</xref>). The fold change of H3K4me3 in late versus early S-phase was lower than that of H3K9me3, indicating a faster restoration of this histone mark, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Reverón-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, among the modifications that showed very fast restoration across all cell lines were the acetylations of H3 on lysine 9 and 64. These results may reflect the more dynamic nature of histone acetylations versus methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rice and Allis, 2001</xref>), and suggest faster kinetics of histone acetyltransferases versus methyltransferases. Moreover, studies of DNA replication timing showed that open, transcriptionally active chromatin is replicated early, while closed chromatin is replicated in late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Klein et al., 2021</xref>). This may account for the higher restoration of H3K9ac and H3K64ac seen in late S-phase, as well as H3K4me3, compared with close chromatin modifications such as H3K9me3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we present the advantages of the CyTOF methodology to achieve a broad analysis of histone modification states in cancer cells at a single-cell resolution. The H3-K27M mutation in DIPG is known to drive drastic epigenetic alterations, however the extent of these alterations, the epigenetic marks that are influenced by it, and its heterogeneity within the population are unclear. We identified downregulation of H3K9me2 and upregulation of H4K16ac as two of the most prominent effects of H3-K27M expression. Schachner et al. recently applied mass spectrometry to intact nucleosomes and showed high levels of H4K16ac on H3-K27M-mutant nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Schachner et al., 2021</xref>), supporting a <italic>cis</italic> effect of the mutation on this specific H4 acetylation. The global increase in H4K16ac observed in our data strongly suggests a <italic>trans</italic> effect as well, similar to H3K27ac. Interestingly, our data suggests that these two acetylations, H3K27ac and H4K16ac, are likely to be distinctly regulated; first, they show a lower correlation between themselves compared to the correlations between H3 acetylations that are known to share enzymatic writers. Second, while H4K16ac is upregulated by H3-K27M, similarly to other acetylations, it shows a distinct behavior during S-phase, where its restoration to newly deposited histones is slow and does not follow H3 acetylations. Finally, studies report that H4K16ac is deposited by a specific writer, MOF, which does not target other lysine residues. Collectively, this data suggests unique functions for this acetylation that are not redundant with H3 acetylations.</p><p id="P28">The single-cell analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity within the DIPG tumor-derived cell lines, generating two distinct epigenetic subpopulations with unique characteristics. Interestingly, these epigenetic subpopulations are associated with inherent heterogeneity in H3-K27M expression, and were not detected in a DIPG line containing WT H3. While H3-K27M is expressed in a gradient across the population, the clear division into two clusters suggests a threshold effect for mediating various epigenetic alterations. In line with this notion is our finding that H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K36me2 and cleaved H3 levels are affected differently by the levels of H3-K27M in individual cells. Moreover, manipulating H3-K27M levels in DIPG cells by overexpression or depletion of the mutant histone induced a shift in the fraction of cells in these two subpopulations, indicating a causal role for H3K27M in generating this epigenetic heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in H3-K27M expression itself could also stem from epigenetic changes in its chromatin environment, generating a feedback mechanism that may further stabilize the two distinct states. Interestingly, while these two states are seen in four different patient-derived DIPG lines, and are reproducible across biological repeats, the fraction of cells in each cluster varies. This suggests that environmental conditions may affect the propensity of cells to be in each of the states. It is currently unclear how stable these subpopulations are, and whether cells can transition from one state to the other. Importantly, H3-K27M heterogeneity is also observed <italic>in-vivo</italic> in DIPG xenograft mouse model and in human tumors, supporting the relevance of these findings to the biology of this cancer.</p><p id="P29">Our work establishes new modes for the analysis of CyTOF data, focusing on epigenetic markers that are expressed in gradients in all cells rather than proteins with binary expression patterns that are often analyzed by CyTOF (i.e., cell surface markers indicative of cell identity, etc.). We developed a normalization strategy to account for technical variation that likely stems from differences in permeability between cells during the staining protocol, and is thus highly important when measuring nuclear proteins. We then leveraged the single-cell data to extrapolate on cross-talk between epigenetic marks. Interestingly, we identified a high correlation between H4K16ac and H3K4me3, which is supported by a reported interaction between the two writers that deposit these modifications: MOF and MLL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dou et al., 2005</xref>). The high correlation suggests the deposition of these two marks may be coordinated in diverse biological systems. Finally, we show that the multiple measurements from individual cells can be leveraged to identify epigenetic changes associated with distinct cell states, for example phases of the cell cycle or early versus late DNA synthesis. Using the core histones for normalization allowed us to follow the restoration of histone modifications during S-phase, establishing the system as complementary to ChOR-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Reverón-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>).

In the current study, we validated some of the antibodies by perturbation experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Other antibodies were previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cheung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fedyuk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shema et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, we cannot rule out potential confounding effects of the use of antibodies on the data.</p><p id="P31">Another limitation of CyTOF is that it is restricted to the detection of global levels of modifications, and thus cannot determine the genomic localizations of the various marks. Moreover, minor changes in the global levels of some modifications might elicit significant downstream biological effects. Finally, changes in global levels measured by CyTOF might be influenced by the baseline abundance of the modification. For example, relatively small changes in highly abundant modifications may translate to large differences in terms of genomic occupancies. Nevertheless, our data indicates that the CyTOF technology is quantitative and highly sensitive even to minor changes, partially mitigating this limitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S14"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P32">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Efrat Shema (<email>efrat.shema@weizmann.ac.il</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P33">Cell lines generated in this study are listed in the key resource table and are available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="S17"><title>HEK293 and HEK293T cultures</title><p id="P34">HEK293 and HEK293T (female) cells were grown in complete DMEM containing 10% FBS (v/v) and 1% P/S (v/v) on 10cm dishes or 6-well plates and passaged by trypsination.

Before harvesting, 5ml FACS tubes were coated with MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm) for 30 minutes at RT or at 4°C overnight, to minimize loss of cells sticking to the sides of the tubes. Staining buffer was aspirated before starting the protocol. Up to 6M cells were harvested into 5ml FACS tubes, washed with in 4ml of MaxPar PBS (Fluidigm), then centrifuged at 400g for 10 minutes with slow break (used throughout the protocol). PBS supernatant was aspirated and the cells were labeled with 1.25μM Cell-ID Cisplatin (Fluidigm) in 1ml PBS for one minute for live/dead staining. Cisplatin was then quenched with 3ml DMEM+10% FBS pre-warmed to 37°C and the cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 400g. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed with 4ml of staining buffer, then centrifuged at 400g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the cells were then gently fixed in 1ml of nuclear antigen staining working solution (Maxpar Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer Set, Fluidigm) for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 700g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 1ml nuclear antigen permeabilization buffer (Maxpar Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer Set, Fluidigm), counted, and the supernatant was discarded as necessary so that no more than 3M cells would enter the next step. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 700g for 10 minutes, the supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 800μl nuclear antigen permeabilization buffer. Palladium-based barcodes (Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit, Fluidigm) were suspended in 100μl of nuclear antigen permeabilization buffer and immediately and completely mixed with the 800μl cells solution, then left on the bench top for 1 hour for complete barcoding. After 1 hour of barcoding, the cells were centrifuged at 700g for 10 minutes, then the supernatant was aspirated. The cells were then washed twice by resuspending them with 4ml nuclear antigen permeabilization buffer and centrifuging at 700g for 10 minutes. The cells were resuspended in 1ml nuclear antigen permeabilization buffer and counted. To ensure even and effective staining, a predetermined volume of antibody per 1M cells, and the total number of cells to be stained, had been titered, validated and prepared in advance, but within 4 hours of staining the cells. To minimize batch effect in sample preparation, the supernatant was discarded and samples were pooled into one tube so that all samples would contribute equally to staining and so that the total number of cells would not exceed the predetermined number, which was adjusted to be between 1M-2M cells per sample. The pooled sample was then centrifuged at 700g for 10 minutes. The total volume of antibodies to add was calculated, then the supernatant was aspirated and the cells were blocked in a volume of normal goat serum (NGS, Cell Signaling Technology) that would constitute 10% of the final solution containing the antibodies. After 10 minutes of blocking, antibodies were added to the solution and the solution was left on the bench top for 30 minutes for staining. Cells were then washed twice by suspending them in 4ml of staining buffer and centrifuging at 700g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and around 50μl of supernatant residual volume was left and in which the cells were resuspended. The cells were fixed in 1-2ml 10% formalin by slowly adding it to the suspension while intermittently tapping the tube. The cells undergoing fixation were kept at 4°C overnight with gentle rocking.
