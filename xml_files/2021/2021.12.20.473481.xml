Drug treatments are currently limited. The MEK inhibitor selumetinib is used for a subset of cases but is not always effective and can cause side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need to discover new drugs to target <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient tumor cells. Using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell model of NF1, we performed synthetic lethal screens to identify novel drug targets. We identified 54 candidates, which were validated with variable dose analysis as a secondary screen. Five candidates could be targeted using existing drugs, with autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1) showing the greatest potential for selectively killing <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. When further investigating autophagy-related genes, we found that 14 out of 30 genes tested had a synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>NF1</italic>. These 14 genes are involved in the regulation of all aspects of the autophagy pathway and can be targeted with additional autophagy drugs, although none were as effective as CQ. The lethal effect of autophagy inhibitors was conserved in a panel of human <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient Schwann cell lines, highlighting their translational potential. The effect of CQ was also conserved in a <italic>Drosophila NF1 in vivo</italic> model and in a xenografted <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient tumor cell line in mice, with CQ treatment resulting in a more significant reduction in tumor growth than selumetinib treatment. Furthermore, combined treatment with CQ and selumetinib resulted in a further reduction in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cell viability. In conclusion, <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells are vulnerable to disruption of the autophagy pathway. This pathway represents a promising therapeutic target for <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors, and CQ was identified as a promising candidate drug for the treatment of <italic>NF1</italic> tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Autophagy</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>Drug repurposing</kwd><kwd>Neurofibromatosis type 1</kwd><kwd>Synthetic lethality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder with autosomal-dominant inheritance affecting 1 in ∼2,700 births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Although the penetrance of NF1 is virtually complete after childhood, the disease is characterized by highly variable clinical expressivity. Symptoms include near universal benign, but often disfiguring, peripheral nerve associated tumors known as neurofibromas, as well as malignant tumors, including usually fatal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In part reflecting higher rates of vascular defects and cancer, the life expectancy of NF1 patients is reduced by approximately 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">NF1 is caused by loss of neurofibromin, a 320 kDa protein whose only widely accepted function is to serve as a RAS GTPase Activating Protein (RASGAP) for H-, K-, N-RAS and R-RAS1, 2, and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). RASGAPs promote the conversion of active RAS-GTP into inactive RAS-GDP by stimulating the low intrinsic rate of RAS-GTP hydrolysis. Consequently, loss of neurofibromin can result in dysregulation of signaling downstream of RAS, the best documented being the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Although dysregulated RAS signaling is believed to be the proximal cause of NF1 symptoms, it is unclear which of the numerous effectors downstream of RAS are relevant for disease progression, as well as the identities of the disease-pertinent targets of the signaling pathways mediating their effects. The situation is further complicated since there is undoubtedly crosstalk between these different pathways. In patients with <italic>NF1</italic>-driven malignant tumors, targeting RAS pathway components such as MEK or ERK is a reasonable therapeutic option, although RAS is subject to highly robust regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), which may explain why, despite considerable effort, effective therapies for RAS-driven cancers have been very challenging to develop. However, chronically blocking RAS may never be an appropriate strategy for treating the many serious but non-life-threatening symptoms of NF1, especially in children.</p><p id="P4">Currently, there are limited therapies for any <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors. The only available drug is the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, which was approved for use in a subset of pediatric plexiform neurofibromas in April 2020. However, not all tumors were responsive to treatment and serious side effects can be associated with MEK inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Therefore, there is a clear clinical need to discover new drugs that specifically target <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient tumor cells either alone or in combination with selumetinib.</p><p id="P5">One approach to identify candidate drug targets for tumorigenic diseases is the use of synthetic lethal interaction screens. Synthetic lethal interactions are a type of genetic interaction in which inhibition of either of two genes alone is viable, but the combined inhibition of both genes is inviable. When one of these genes is mutated in tumor cells, such interactions can be exploited to kill those cells exclusively by targeting the synthetic lethal partner gene using a drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This approach is attractive because treatment is expected to be lethal to tumor cells but have no effect on wild-type, healthy cells.</p><p id="P6">Despite long-term interest in the use of synthetic lethality as a therapeutic strategy to treat tumors, few drugs have successfully progressed to clinical use. A major factor preventing successful development of treatments against synthetic lethal interactions is a lack of consistency between interactions identified in different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Therefore, candidates identified from a single model system often fail to translate to other model systems and subsequently to clinical use. To overcome this limitation, our approach makes use of diverse model systems by first screening for synthetic lethal interactions with genes mutated in tumors using <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. The conservation of candidate interactions can then be assessed in a range of other model systems, including human cells, providing a filter to remove interactions that are specific to a single model system. This approach has previously proved successful, leading to the discovery of mizoribine and palbociclib as promising candidates for the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-linked cancers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In both cases, hits from <italic>Drosophila</italic> synthetic lethal screens were validated with a high success rate in both human cells and mouse models.</p><p id="P7">Given the previous success of using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> approach, we have applied this method to identify candidate drug targets to treat <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient tumors. Here, we describe the generation of a <italic>dNF1</italic> null mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line using CRISPR gene editing and its use in 1) conducting synthetic lethal screens to identify perturbed pathways that confer vulnerability of NF1-deficient cells, and 2) to identify candidate drug targets that might be used for therapeutic benefit to specifically kill NF1-associated tumors. We find dNF1-deficient cells are vulnerable to inhibition of autophagy. Importantly, we show that this selective effect can be reproduced with multiple inhibitors and in several human tumor-derived cell lines, as well as in a <italic>Drosophila in vivo</italic> NF1 model and xenografts of <italic>NF1-</italic>deficient tumor cell lines in mice, indicating that these repurposed drugs may have promise for the treatment of <italic>NF1</italic> tumors. Finally, we show that combined treatment with CQ or bafilomycin A1 and selumetinib results in increased selective killing of <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells, indicating the potential for combinatorial therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Schwann cell <italic>NF1</italic> models using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing</title><p id="P8">Our previous studies have demonstrated the potential of using cross-species genetic screens to identify candidate therapeutic targets for human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The <italic>NF1</italic> gene is well conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans with 68% identity at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To use the same approach to find new targets for the treatment of <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors, we first used CRISPR gene editing to generate indel mutations in <italic>dNF1</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells. Sequencing was used to confirm that the induced frame-shift mutations resulted in null <italic>dNF1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, S2R+ cells are aneuploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and our sequencing results suggest that they have three copies of the <italic>dNF1</italic> gene.</p><p id="P9">The resulting dNF1-KO S2R+ cell line (hereafter called dNF1-KO) was characterized by assessing the expression of neurofibromin using western blots. We found no detectable signal in the dNF1-KO line compared to parental wild-type (WT) S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). However, we found no significant increase in pERK levels in dNF1-KO cells under normal culturing conditions, suggesting that other growth conditions (i.e., reduced serum) may be necessary to exacerbate differences in RAS signaling, as is necessary in other NF1 cell line models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Given that neurofibromin is a negative regulator of RAS, we assessed the growth and proliferative phenotypes of dNF1-KO cells compared to S2R+ cells. Consistent with deregulation of a mitogenic pathway, dNF1-KO cells showed an increased rate of growth as measured using CellTiter-Glo assays to assess total ATP levels in the population. This effect was observed in both the presence and absence of serum in the culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that culture growth is both accelerated in the absence of dNF1 and is decoupled from upstream growth factor signaling pathways. To determine whether this increase in culture growth was due to increased proliferation, increased cell growth, or both, we performed cell counts following culture in full serum and CellTiter-Glo assays on normalized numbers of cells from each genotype (baseline readings). Cell counts for dNF1-KO showed an increase in cell numbers following culture compared to S2R+ cells, and the ‘baseline’ CellTiter-Glo showed no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that the difference in culture growth is primarily due to increased cell proliferation rather than an increase in the cell size or ATP content of the cells. Together, these results indicate that the dNF1-KO line represents a novel <italic>dNF1</italic> null mutant cell model, with properties consistent with known effects of NF1 loss.</p><p id="P10">We also utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate indel mutations within exon 3 of <italic>NF1</italic> in wild-type immortalized human Schwann cells (ipn02.3 2λ). Sequencing of single cell clones was used to confirm out-of-frame deletions in one or both <italic>NF1</italic> alleles, resulting in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The resulting heterozygous (C8) and homozygous (C23) cell lines were characterized by assessing neurofibromin expression using western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Consistent with what we observed in dNF1-KO cells, there was no significant increase in pERK expression under normal culturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). These results suggest that these otherwise isogenic human cell lines are an appropriate model to validate any results obtained in our dNF1-KO cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mapping synthetic lethal interactions in dNF1-KO cells using a genome-wide RNAi screen</title><p id="P11">We used a genome-wide dsRNA library to screen in both S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells for synthetic lethal interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Correlation coefficients ranged between 0.9 and 0.99 (average 0.93) for control wells and between 0.55 and 0.66 (average 0.61) for non-control wells, illustrating a high rate of reproducibility between replicates. Next, we identified synthetic lethal interactions by filtering the results for dsRNA reagents that reduced the viability of dNF1-KO cells (median Z&lt;-1.5) to a greater extent than wild-type cells (median Z⩾-1.5). This analysis identified 134 candidate genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Genetic screens are often associated with false-positive results due to off-target effects from dsRNA reagents or noise in the screen assay. To remove potential false positives, we overlaid the screen hits onto a protein-protein interaction network from the String database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Synthetic lethal interactions are generally similar between genes that have related functions; therefore, proteins that physically interact are expected to share synthetic lethal interactions. Using the combination of physical and genetic interaction data, we could remove false positives from the screen results by isolating only hits that have physical interactions with at least one other hit from the genetic interaction screen. In addition, we filtered the candidates to isolate only those with clear orthologs in humans. Following this process, 54 high-confidence candidate targets remained, corresponding to 74 human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Validation of candidate synthetic lethal interactions using Variable Dose Analysis (VDA)</title><p id="P13">We used the VDA assay as an additional combinatorial screen to assess synthetic lethality between <italic>dNF1</italic> and all 54 candidate drug targets. Two shRNAs targeting each of the genes were generated. These reagents were tested in S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells. Of the 54 genes, 46 showed a &gt;10% reduction in viability in dNF1-KO cells compared to S2R+ controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; ranked in order of effect on dNF1-KO viability). These results indicate that the network is a reliable representation of the synthetic lethal interaction profile of the <italic>dNF1</italic> gene.</p><p id="P14">To identify potential drugs for repurposing to treat NF1 tumors, we filtered the candidate gene list to those that could be targeted using existing drugs, resulting in eight candidate drug targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then removed candidates that had previously been studied in relation to NF1, leaving five candidate drug targets. We also included MEK (selumetinib) as a control. Note that three drugs that target autophagy were included, and some drugs inhibited multiple targets. In total we tested seven candidate drugs inhibiting six different targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Existing inhibitors selectively affect <italic>dNF1</italic>-KO <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells</title><p id="P15">Repurposing existing drugs represents the most efficient route to develop new therapeutics. Each of the seven drugs that target the <italic>dNF1</italic> synthetic lethal partner genes were first tested in S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells using CellTiter-Glo assays to measure viability after 48 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Of the seven drugs tested in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we selected the two autophagy inhibitors (CQ and bafilomycin A1) for further study, as both showed a significant and consistent effect on reducing dNF1-KO viability.</p><p id="P16">One of the strongest hits from the genetic screen was <italic>Atg8b</italic>, which encodes a key component of the autophagy pathway. Autophagy is commonly inhibited experimentally using CQ, which is clinically used as an anti-malarial and shows anti-viral properties, and bafilomycin A1. CQ functions to inhibit autophagy by blocking the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes by diffusing into the lysosomes and altering the acidic environment, thereby inhibiting autophagic lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). On the other hand, bafilomycin A1 disrupts autophagic flux by independently inhibiting V-ATPase-dependent acidification and Ca-P60A/SERCA-dependent autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We initially focused on CQ because it is generally well-tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and can inhibit autophagy <italic>in vivo</italic> at clinically achievable concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Bafilomycin A1 is a potent inhibitor of autophagy but is not clinically approved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Nevertheless, we tested bafilomycin A1 to provide additional validation of the effects on autophagy inhibition brought about through an independent mechanism.</p><p id="P17">First, we quantified autophagic flux in dNF1-KO an dS2R+ cells without drug treatment, i.e., how many autophagosomes form and then become degraded, by measuring the difference in the number of autophagic vesicles in the presence versus the absence of a lysosomal inhibitor, CQ. We observed significantly higher levels of autophagic flux in dNF1-KO cells under serum-free conditions compared to S2R+ controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then tested whether CQ and bafilomycin A1 would phenocopy the selective effect observed using genetic inhibition of <italic>Atg8b</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Both S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells were treated with varying doses of CQ or bafilomycin A1 and cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo assays, PI staining, and annexin V staining. A significantly greater effect on dNF1-KO cell viability was observed at multiple concentrations of each drug in serum-free media after 48 h of treatment across all three assays, further validating the interaction between autophagy and NF1 and demonstrating that the effect is cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Both early- and late-stage autophagy genes have a synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>dNF1</italic>, which can be targeted with other autophagy inhibitors</title><p id="P18">Autophagy is a complex process involving multiple stages and many different proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine whether more specific targeting of autophagy components would result in a greater selective effect in <italic>dNF1</italic>-KO cells, we performed an additional VDA screen to assess for synthetic lethal interactions between <italic>dNF1</italic> and 29 key autophagy genes (in addition to <italic>Atg8b</italic>) using S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells (all 29 genes screened are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>). In total, 14 genes, in addition to the previously identified <italic>Atg8b</italic>, were found to significantly reduce dNF1-KO viability by &gt;10% relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, these 14 genes are implicated across all stages of the autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, genes shown in red). Therefore, we tested drugs targeting specific aspects of the autophagy pathway in dNF1-KO cells, including MRT68921 (an early-stage autophagy inhibitor of ULK1 and ULK2), VPS34-IN1 (a potent early-stage autophagy inhibitor of the PI3K-III complex), NSC 185058 (a mid-stage inhibitor of <italic>Atg4b</italic>), CA5f (a late-stage inhibitor of autophagic flux), and obatoclax (a late-stage autophagy inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In general, the autophagy inhibitors showed a selective viability effect in dNF1-KO cells, except for MRT68921 and NSC 185058 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-G</xref>); however, none of the drugs were deemed to be more effective in selectively killing dNF1-KO cells than CQ and bafilomycin A1. CQ also has the advantage of being FDA-approved. Therefore, although targeting autophagy at various stages of the pathway appears to have selective viability effects in dNF1-KO cells, the late-stage autophagy inhibitor CQ could provide the greatest potential for use in the clinic to treat NF1.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CQ and bafilomycin A1 selectively affect <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient human cells</title><p id="P19">To determine whether the selective effect of CQ and bafilomycin A1 was conserved in human cells, we tested the effects of drug treatment on a panel of human <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cell lines.

Using genetic screening of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we identified 54 candidate synthetic lethal genes that when knocked down resulted in the death of <italic>NF1-</italic>deficient cells without impacting the viability of wild-type, healthy cells. Of these genes, 85% (46/54) were validated in secondary assays, indicating the high quality of the screen results. A key outcome from this screen was the identification of <italic>Atg8b</italic> as a synthetic lethal partner of <italic>NF1</italic>. Atg8b (human ortholog: <italic>GABARAP</italic>) is an autophagy-related protein located in the autophagosome. Autophagy is the process where damaged organelles and unfolded proteins are sequestered into autophagosomes in the cytoplasm, which then undergo fusion with lysosomes (autolysosomes), resulting in degradation of the intracellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). This is important in the regulation of cell growth, maturation, and death.</p><p id="P32">In cancer, autophagy is reported to take on two opposing roles: 1) degradation of damaged organelles and recycling of macromolecules to maintain a stable cellular environment, which prevents the formation of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>); and 2) aiding in cancer cell survival in response to growth-limiting conditions, contributing to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Furthermore, autophagy has been widely reported to promote cancer cell survival through a drug resistance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Therefore, targeting the autophagy pathway is a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of cancer.</p><p id="P33">Autophagy is a complex process involving many different genes. In addition to <italic>Atg8b</italic>, <italic>Uba1</italic> was also identified in the screen, which is also linked to autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). While the selective effects of inhibiting <italic>Atg8b</italic> and <italic>Uba1</italic> were consistent and reproducible in secondary assays, it was surprising that more autophagy linked genes were not identified in our screens. Upon further investigation, we found that approximately half of the 30 autophagy genes tested with low throughput assays showed the selective effects observed with <italic>Atg8b</italic>. These genes have roles from early-stage vesicle induction to late-stage fusion of the autophagosome and lysosome. These results suggest that the entire autophagy pathway is dysregulated in <italic>dNF1</italic>-KO cells, and it is likely that other autophagy genes were missed by the screen due to ineffective RNAi reagents or noise.</p><p id="P34">Interestingly, <italic>Atg5,</italic> which is involved in the induction of autophagy via autophagic vesicle formation, was found to have the most significant synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>NF1.</italic> Previous studies have implicated ATG5 upregulation in RAS-induced autophagy and malignant cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). However, at present, there are no commercially available inhibitors of ATG5. Further studies are required to determine the exact autophagy genes that are dysregulated in our panel of human <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cell lines.</p><p id="P35">In total, we assessed seven autophagy inhibitors, and all reproduced the selective effects in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells. However, there was some variation in effects with some drugs not being effective across all cell lines tested. CQ appears to be the most promising of the drugs that we tested for clinical application. It is already approved for clinical use and produced the most consistent and robust effects across the different NF1 cell models that we tested. CQ is a widely used anti-malarial that functions to inhibit autophagy by blocking the binding of autophagosomes to lysosomes by diffusing into the lysosomes and altering the acidic environment, thereby inhibiting autophagic lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CQ has anti-tumor properties in several types of cancer, including glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). In addition, a recent study reported that the expression of metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) was down-regulated in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient fibroblasts, with a further reduction associated with lysosomal degradation of MMP1. Interestingly, treatment of <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells with CQ restored MMP1 expression via two mechanisms: activation of the AHR/ERK pathway to enhance the mRNA and protein expression of MMP1, and inhibition of the lysosomal degradation of MMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Although this study did not assess whether autophagy was dysregulated in the <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient fibroblasts and did not assess Schwann cells or cells derived from NF1 tumors, it does highlight the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibition. Similarly, we found that CQ significantly reduced dNF1-KO cell viability relative to wild-type S2R+ cells across a range of concentrations under conditions where autophagy is induced (serum starvation of cells and <italic>NF1</italic> deficiency). This effect of CQ was conserved across a panel of three human <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cell lines, two of which were derived from neurofibromas from NF1 patients. Furthermore, CQ altered the survival of <italic>dNf1</italic>-deficient <italic>Drosophila in vivo</italic> and reduced the growth of <italic>NF1</italic>-mutant xenografts in mice to an even greater extent than selumetinib. The doses of CQ and selumetinib administered to the mice were deemed non-toxic, as has been widely reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Through the inhibition of autophagy with CQ, we observed an increased level of apoptosis in the CQ-treated xenografts, as assessed with the levels of cleaved PARP. Therefore, CQ shows great potential as a therapeutic agent for <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors.</p><p id="P36">While there is a vast array of evidence for the efficacy and safety of CQ, the underlying mechanisms of the tumor suppressive actions of CQ remain to be determined. One potential mechanism is that under starvation conditions, such as those used in this study (i.e. serum starvation), a reduction in glucose transport results in a release of mTOR inhibition of the ULK1 complex, inducing vesicle nucleation and facilitating the process of autophagy. Inhibition of the lysosome using CQ has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and induce tumor cell death <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). We speculate that <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells are more susceptible to autophagy inhibition with CQ because the baseline levels of autophagy are higher. RAS has previously been shown to regulate autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). In addition, cancers associated with <italic>RAS</italic> mutations have been reported to be dependent on autophagy, although this appears to be tumor cell line dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Therefore, cancers with aberrant RAS activity can be more susceptible to autophagy inhibition with CQ. Neurofibromin functions as a RASGAP (GTPase-activating protein), which facilitates RAS inactivation by enabling its GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). In <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors, neurofibromin expression is downregulated or absent, resulting in aberrant RAS activity and upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. Therefore, aberrant RAS activity is expected to negatively regulate autophagy; however, RAS is implicated in many signaling pathways and so it has a multifaceted role in autophagy regulation. For example, RAS also activates the RAF1/MEK1/2/ERK and RAC1/MKK7/JNK signaling pathways, both of which are known to activate autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Furthermore, upregulation of ATG5 and ATG7 has been implicated in RAS-induced autophagy and malignant cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that aberrant RAS activity in <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells results in the initiation of autophagy, and that inhibition of this pathway has anti-tumor effects. When combining our data on the effects of CQ and bafilomycin A1, we provide strong evidence for inhibition of the autophagy pathway as a target in the treatment of <italic>NF1</italic>-associated tumors.</p><p id="P37">Finally, we found that inhibition of autophagy with CQ and bafilomycin A1 increased the sensitivity of <italic>NF1</italic>-deficient cells (both dNF1-KO and human <italic>NF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells) to MEK1/2 inhibition with selumetinib. Selumetinib is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The phase 2 trial (SPRINT) for the use of selumetinib in plexiform neurofibromas reported clinically meaningful improvements in 71% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), prompting its FDA approval for patients ages 2 to 18 years with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. However, there are toxicity effects related to long-term MEK inhibition. Interestingly, selumetinib had no selective effect in the dNF1-KO cells compared to wild-type S2R+ controls when used alone. Furthermore, we observed no difference in the phosphorylation of ERK between S2R+ and dNF1-KO cells under baseline conditions, which suggests that RAS activity levels are similar in the two cell lines. Therefore, while there is extensive evidence that RAS activation leads to dependence on autophagy, it is possible that there is a second, RAS-independent, mechanism that also contributes to the selective effect of autophagy inhibition. Such a mechanism may explain why we see a combinatorial effect of autophagy inhibition and MEK1/2 inhibition. This finding is in line with a previous study, which showed that combined inhibition of MEK1/2 plus autophagy had a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines, which display aberrant K-RAS activity, as well as patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>).</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, we have shown using multiple techniques, reagents, and models that inhibition of autophagy has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NF1 tumors. Given the existing clinical use of CQ and the robust and conserved effects that we observe between cell culture models, this candidate drug has a high chance of successful translation to the clinic, resulting in a positive impact on NF1 patients.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P39"><italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider (S2R+) cells, both WT and dNF1-KO, were cultured at 25°C in Schneider’s media (Gibco) containing 1% antibiotic (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).

Cells were co-stained with propidium iodide (PI) to detect dead cells in the population. S2R+ cells were left to adhere for 40 mins at 25℃ before treatment. Cells were treated with 1 µl per well of each drug (CQ, bafilomycin A1) in PBS at varying concentrations, and incubated for 48 h.

Lysates for testing expression of neurofibromin were resolved on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate and for assessing levels of pERK/ERK on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris protein gels.

Two million ST88-14 cells mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (ThermoFisher Scientific) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of male CD-1 nude mice (Charles River Laboratories). Tumors were measured three times weekly with a caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated as follows: [(length + width) / 2] x length x width. Once the tumor diameter began to increase over two separate measurements, mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or CQ (50 mg/kg in saline) or received selumetinib (25 mg/kg in saline) via oral gavage three times per week (n=6 mice per group). Mice were culled by cervical dislocation (Schedule 1) when the control tumor sizes reached the allowed endpoint (12 mm in diameter), and tumors were dissected. Tumors were flash frozen for further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS151351-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS151351-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS151351-supplement-Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS151351-supplement-Table_S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by a Medical Research Council project grant (MR/V009583/1) and a Medical Research Council Confidence in Concept (CiC) award (MC_PC_19037) to B.H. and NIH R21 NS096402, DOD-NFRP W81XWH-16-1-0220 and the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP) (J.A.W.).

Alone, selumetinib significantly reduced the viability of S2R+ but not dNF1-KO cells after 48 h in serum-free media, as measured using CellTiter Glo assays. In combination with CQ or bafilomycin A1, selumetinib resulted in a significantly greater reduction in dNF1-KO cell viability compared to CQ alone, which was not observed in S2R+ cells (n=3; p values obtained using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey for multiple comparisons). <bold>(B)</bold> In a similar experiment in human cell lines, selumetinib alone had no effect on the viability of C8, C23 (10 μM), ipnNF95.11C (5 µM), ipnNF09.4, and ipNF05.5 (10 µM) <bold>(B-D)</bold>; however, it did significantly decrease viability of ipNF95.11b ‘C’ NF1<sup>-/-</sup> (5 µM) <bold>(C)</bold>. Similar to observations in Drosophila cells, the effect of CQ was enhanced when combined with selumetinib in all three NF1<sup>-/-</sup> cell lines (50 nM, 100 pM, and 50 nM, respectively), whereas the effect of bafilomycin A1 (100 pM, 1 nM, and 1 nM, respectively) was enhanced by selumetinib only in the patient-derived NF1-deficient cell lines (ipNF95.11b ‘C’ and ipNF05.5).
