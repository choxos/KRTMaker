infections are imperative to help understand and prevent this disease. Here we implemented RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) combined with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-reads to measure differential host gene expression, transcript polyadenylation and isoform usage within various epithelial cell lines permissive and non-permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells), Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) and A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial cells) were analysed over time (0, 2, 24, 48 hours). Differential polyadenylation was found to occur in both infected Calu-3 and Vero cells during a late time point (48 hpi), with Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as viral transcription and translation shown to be significantly enriched in Calu-3 data. Poly(A) tails showed increased lengths in the majority of the differentially polyadenylated transcripts in Calu-3 and Vero cell lines (up to ~101 nt in mean poly(A) length, padj = 0.029). Of these genes, ribosomal protein genes such as <italic>RPS4X</italic> and <italic>RPS6</italic> also showed downregulation in expression levels, suggesting the importance of ribosomal protein genes during infection. Furthermore, differential transcript usage was identified in Caco-2, Calu-3 and Vero cells, including transcripts of genes such as <italic>GSDMB</italic> and <italic>KPNA2,</italic> which have previously been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Overall, these results highlight the potential role of differential polyadenylation and transcript usage in host immune response or viral manipulation of host mechanisms during infection, and therefore, showcase the value of long-read sequencing in identifying less-explored host responses to disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The Severe Acute Respiratory Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and is the causative agent of the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported over 5.1 million deaths and over 258 million confirmed cases globally as of late November 2021, and the global health, social and economic burden due to this disease continues to grow. Extensive research on this virus has been carried out since the first discovery of the pathogen. Nevertheless, continued exploration of the host response during an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is imperative for developing novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and prophylactics.</p><p id="P4">The host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been comprehensively studied within the past two years. This includes transcriptomic studies of the host using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from <italic>in vitro</italic> infections of cell lines/primary cells, <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models in ferrets as well as clinical samples from infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Of these, <italic>in vitro</italic> SARS-CoV-2 infection studies using continuous cell lines have been commonly used, due to the simplicity of the model. Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial) cells are known for their high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, due to their defective interferon I responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Emeny &amp; Morgan, 1979</xref>). However, due to the lack of biological relevance using these cells, human epithelial cells have mostly been used for assessing host responses instead of Vero cells, such as Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial) and A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial) cells. SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells exhibited upregulation of genes involved in innate immune response to viral infections such as <italic>IFIT2, OAS2,</italic> or <italic>IFNB1,</italic> similar to the responses elicited by the SARS-CoV-1 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>). Also, in both Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells, genes involved in response to Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases were upregulated during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>). However, responses between Calu-3 and Caco-2 were found to be cell-specific. Caco-2 cells lacked in innate immune responses when infected with SARS-CoV-1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Shuai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>), and have shown fewer changes at the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>) and protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Saccon et al., 2021</xref>) compared to Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, A549 cells have shown lack of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, despite being a human airway epithelial cell line like Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Harcourt et al., 2020</xref>). This has been attributed to the lack of the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 - Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 <italic>(ACE2)</italic> – on the surface of these cells. However, air-liquid interface culturing or <italic>ACE2</italic>-expressing A549 (A549-hACE2) cells enhanced the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, host responses appeared to vary between different epithelial cell lines and were dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the virus in <italic>A549-hACE2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Most RNA-seq data reported in the literature have been generated using short-read sequencing methods such as Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bibert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Islam et al., 2021</xref>). In these studies, differential expression and Gene Ontology (GO)/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses have been the main outcomes. Short-read RNA-seq is an effective technique for measuring differential mRNA abundance. However, utilising a long-read sequencing platform provides the ability to discern other functionally significant mRNA features such as length of the poly(A) tails, alternative splicing, and differential isoform usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Jong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Paoli-Iseppi, Gleeson, &amp; Clark, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gleeson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Workman et al., 2019</xref>). These additional mRNA features have been linked with different disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Curinha, Oliveira Braz, Pereira-Castro, Cruz, &amp; Moreira, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tazi, Bakkour, &amp; Stamm, 2009</xref>). However, these events have not been studied in depth for infectious diseases, especially with SARS-CoV-2 infections. An ability to measure full-length transcripts, polyadenylation status and isoform usage would permit significantly enriched insights into host responses to viral infection than standard RNA-seq methods allow.</p><p id="P6">Here we report the use of RNA-seq methods from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform (direct RNA, direct cDNA and PCR cDNA) to carry out an in-depth investigation into the host response to SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro.</italic> The responses were visualised throughout a time-course (0, 2, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi)) using four epithelial cell lines (Vero, Calu-3, Caco-2 and A549). Previously we performed a comprehensive analysis of the viral response for some of these datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). In this current study, we investigated differential polyadenylation and transcript usage between infected and mock control cells. Additionally, we were interested in whether long-read differential expression analysis conveyed similar differential expression results to short-read RNA-seq studies shown in literature. Overall, our study demonstrated the value of long-read sequencing in identifying less-explored host responses to disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Cell culture and RNA extraction/preparation</title><p id="P7">Cell culture and RNA extraction/preparation methods have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>) for Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial - ATCC HTB-55), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial - ATCC HTB-37) and Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial - ATCC CCL-81) cells. For this current study, we additionally cultured A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial – ATCC CCL-185) cells to supplement our main data, using similar methods. Briefly, A549, Vero, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines were cultured in T75 flasks and maintained at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. A549 cells were cultured with Ham's F-12K (Kaighn's) Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine (Media Preparation Unit, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute)), 100 IU penicillin, 10 μg streptomycin/mL, 1X non-essential amino acids (Gibco-BRL) and 50 μM B-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies). All cell lines were seeded in 4 x 6-well tissue-culture plates and maintained at 70-80% confluency for infection. Three wells of the 6-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) at a MOI of 0.1 and the remaining wells were used as mock controls for four time points (0, 2, 24 and 48 hpi). Total cellular RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), treated with the Turbo DNAse-free Kit (Invitrogen) and purified with RNAClean XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). The final resulting RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water. Quality control was carried out using NanoDrop 2000C (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p id="P8">Library preparation and sequencing methods have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, RNA from mock control and infected cells harvested at 0, 2, 24 and 48 hpi from Caco-2, Calu-3 and Vero cells was sequenced with the ONT Direct cDNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-DCS109) in conjunction with the Native Barcoding Kit (EXP-NBD104). RNA harvested at 2, 24 and 48 hpi was sequenced with the Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA002) by pooling the RNA from replicate wells. For this current study, RNA from A549 cells was sequenced as per our previous work with minor modifications in the number of time points sequenced, to supplement our main data. The ONT Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA002) was used to prepare 6 μg of pooled total RNA (2 μg RNA from each replicate well) from control and infected cells at the 24 hpi. The Direct cDNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-DCS109) was used in conjunction with the Native Barcoding Kit (EXP-NBD104) to prepare 3 μg of total RNA from all control and infected replicates separately at both 0 and 24 hpi time points. All direct RNA and direct cDNA libraries were loaded onto a R9.4.1 MinION flow cell and sequenced for 72 hrs using an ONT MinION or GridION. Additionally, PCR cDNA long-read sequencing was carried out with RNA from all four cell lines (Vero, Caco-2, Calu-3 and A549 cells) using the following methods: cDNA libraries were constructed with the PCR-cDNA Sequencing (SQK-PCS109) and PCR Barcoding (SQK-PBK004) kits using the supplied protocol. RNA samples from 0 and 24 (hpi) were randomised and multiplexed for sequencing in groups of six using sequential barcodes. 100 ng of sample RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. Transcripts were amplified by PCR and barcodes added using the specified cycling conditions with a 7 min extension time and 13x cycles. Amplified samples were individually cleaned using 0.5x AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The length distribution was determined via the TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies) before pooling. Equimolar amounts of each barcoded sample were pooled to a total of 100 – 200 fmol (assuming median transcript size = 1.1 kb). 100 fmol of final libraries were loaded onto a R9.4.1 MinION flow cell and sequenced for 72 hrs on an ONT GridION. Run metrics were monitored live and if active pores dropped below 200, any remaining library was loaded following a nuclease flush. Synthetic ‘sequin’ RNA standards, provided in two mixes (A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hardwick et al., 2016</xref>), were added to each sample in direct RNA and PCR cDNA libraries. Mix A and B sequins, diluted 1:250 (approximately 6-10% of estimated total mRNA), were added to infected and control samples, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P9">Publicly available data from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>) in combination with data generated from this study were analysed using Spartan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Meade, Lafayette, Sauter, &amp; Tosello, 2017</xref>) and Nectar from the Australia Research Data Commons.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Basecalling, alignment and generating counts files</title><p id="P10">All FAST5 files were basecalled using standalone <italic>Guppy</italic> v3.5.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://community.nanoporetech.com/sso/login?next_url=%2Fdownloads">https://community.nanoporetech.com/sso/login?next_url=%2Fdownloads</ext-link>), except PCR cDNA data from Vero cells which were live-basecalled using <italic>Guppy</italic> v3.2.8.

The lack of significance in the <italic>tailfindr</italic> poly(A) data can be explained by the fact that less data was available from the poly(A) dataset compared to the poly(T) dataset. The full-length reads were comprised of 0.5% of poly(A) and 99.5% of poly(T) strands, which made up ~58% of the total number of detected reads with valid Ensembl ID’s. This may be attributed to the process of ONT direct cDNA sequencing, where the motor protein is situated on the 5’ end of each strand. This means that the poly(T) sequence is sequenced first, whereas the poly(A) sequence is sequenced last for each respective strand.

The results from the mixed-effects model analysis showed poly(A) tail elongation after infection in Calu-3 and Vero cells at the 48 hpi.

This indicated that polyadenylation may play a role in aiding the virus to generate viral mRNA for further protein production or to replicate during infection with SARS-CoV-2. This group of genes is involved in the formation of the ribosome, which is required for protein synthesis. The result is relevant as the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein Nsp1 binds to the 40S subunit of the ribosome and inhibits translation initiation of cellular mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lapointe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>).

Therefore, further investigation is warranted to explore the link between increased polyadenylation in host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. It would also be of interest to study whether host defense ability decreases with elevated polyadenylation of transcripts related to viral transcription and the ribosome. A lncRNA and a small number of mitochondrial transcripts were also observed with an elongated poly(A) length in infected cells compared with control cells. This is of interest as it suggests that not only the protein-coding genes may be able to play a role in host responses to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, as elongated poly(A) tails were observed at a late time point (48 hpi) in Vero cells, it suggested that differential polyadenylation may be more likely to occur at later stages of infection compared with early stages.</p><p id="P37">We also explored the observation that many of the genes involved in the commonly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were increased in poly(A) tail length and decreased in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of genes which were involved in both of these observations were ribosomal proteins, such as <italic>RPS4X</italic> and <italic>RPS6</italic> which encode for proteins in the 40S ribosomal subunit. In contrast, a non-ribosomal gene <italic>CXCL8</italic> had increases in both poly(A) length and expression level after infection, which suggested that this correlation belonged exclusively to the ribosomal protein genes. This was an interesting observation as decreased expression of ribosomal proteins in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections have been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lieberman et al., 2020</xref>), due to the effect of global suppression of ribosomal activity initiated by the virus. However, the increase in poly(A) lengths in the same transcripts was unexpected, as elongation of poly(A) tails are indicative of increase in stability, in contrast to the decrease in expression levels. Why these observations were uniquely presented in these ribosomal protein genes is currently unclear. However, we speculate this may be due to the competition between viral-driven expression downregulation and host-driven post-transcriptional regulation for increased stability of mRNA. In some cases, aberrant polyadenylation has been linked to aid the destruction of eukaryotic mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Y. J. Lee &amp; Glaunsinger, 2009</xref>), which may provide an alternative explanation for this phenomenon.</p><p id="P38">Supporting the importance of the ribosome during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the <italic>translation</italic> GO term was enriched in infected Calu-3 and Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Among the genes involved in translation, the <italic>EIF1</italic> gene encodes for the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1, which partakes in translation initiation in eukaryotes by forming a part of the 43S preinitiation complex along with the 40S ribosomal subunit. As mentioned earlier, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lapointe et al., (2021</xref>), this factor may enhance the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein to the host 40S subunit, perhaps via changing the conformation of the mRNA entry channel. This facilitates host translation inhibition by competing with host mRNA, which has been shown to also decrease translation of viral mRNA. However, another study showed that the binding of Nsp1 to the 40S subunit induced preferential translation of viral mRNA over host mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>). These findings may explain the downregulation the <italic>EIF1</italic> as a host response to viral infection.</p><p id="P39">Differential transcript usage has not yet been extensively studied with SARS-CoV-2 infections but has been useful for studying other illnesses like Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dick et al., 2020</xref>). Differential transcript usage was observed in all three SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell lines studied – Caco-2, Calu-3 and Vero, where protein-coding, processed and retained-intron transcripts were involved. Calu-3 48 hpi data showed the greatest number of genes that had undergone differential transcript usage, where a retained-intron transcript <italic>GSDMB-208</italic> showed differential usage in infected cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 induces pyroptosis in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>), and the Gasdermin family of proteins has been implicated in cell death where the granzyme-mediated cleavage of GSDMB can activate pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Z. Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>KPNA2</italic> transcripts also showed differential usage in Calu-3 cells at 48 hpi. <italic>KPNA2</italic> is an importin that is bound by ORF6 of the virus to block nuclear IRF3 and ISGF3 to antagonise IFN-1 production and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). This suggested that transcripts with differential usage may be involved in important pathways contributing to host responses towards viral infection or the evasion of these responses by the virus. Hence, the specific activity of each transcript as opposed to the activity at the gene level should be further investigated.</p><p id="P40">Overall, our long-read sequencing datasets agreed with differential expression studies in the literature. In agreement with previous studies, our differential expression analysis using direct cDNA datasets showed varied host gene expression activity upon infection in different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Although Vero cells are imperfect <italic>in vitro</italic> models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we note that the <italic>ROS metabolic pathway</italic> was enriched in our direct cDNA data across the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). The mitochondria can be linked to the ROS metabolic pathway as it produces ROS which can induce increased oxidative stress in cells, potentially leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Orrenius, 2007</xref>). These results increased support for the idea that mitochondrial processes are important during these infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Codo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Singh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We also observed the downregulation of pathways involved in neurological pathologies such as <italic>Parkinson’s disease</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Martinelli et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). The fact that some enriched pathways were involved in non-respiratory, neurological illnesses suggests potential modes of action for SARS-CoV-2 co-morbidities. There are now increasing numbers of studies reporting on the relevance between COVID-19 and other diseases. This includes clinical data where patients with COVID-19 can develop neurological problems which are not only non-specific (e.g. headaches), but also varied, including such maladies as viral meningitis, encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moriguchi et al., 2020</xref>), olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Luers et al., 2020</xref>), and dementia-related symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Y. Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). However, the relevance of this pathway in non-neuronal cells is potentially limited.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Limitations &amp; future directions</title><p id="P42">In our study, we utilised <italic>in vitro</italic> models of SARS-CoV-2 infections using continuous cell lines with a low MOI of 0.1, which may hinder the biological relevance of these results. However, our results confirmed that the use of ONT RNA-seq methods enabled the detection of full-length isoforms, differential polyadenylation and transcript usage. This provides evidence to pursue further investigations with more sophisticated models such as air-liquid-interface cultured organoids from healthy human nasal swabs or <italic>in vivo</italic> models such as ferrets. The ideal MOI should also be found via optimisation studies.</p><p id="P43">Moreover, our results showed that the <italic>nanopolish</italic> and <italic>tailfindr</italic> methods had significant weak positive correlations (r &lt; 0.3, p-value &lt; 0.05) in the median poly(A) lengths from <italic>nanopolish</italic> and median poly(T) lengths from <italic>tailfindr</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4</xref>). However, the median poly(A) lengths of <italic>tailfindr</italic> showed non-significant correlations with <italic>nanopolish</italic> poly(A) data. The increased significance of poly(T) transcripts may have occurred because more data was available from the poly(T) dataset. As our results supported similar findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Krause et al. (2019)</xref>, we speculate that these discrepancies between poly(A) and poly(T) datasets using ONT direct cDNA sequencing may arise in future studies. We acknowledge that our data is preliminary and the correlation between <italic>nanopolish</italic> and <italic>tailfindr</italic> data should be tested via direct RNA datasets with replicates to validate these findings.</p><p id="P44">Functional work should also be carried out to further validate the results of this study. For differential expression analysis, knock-down experiments within the same cell lines using CRISPR technology may be utilised to evaluate the effects of differentially expressed genes identified in this study. Furthermore, functional work for polyadenylation may be approached by utilising cell lines with plasmids containing gene sequences of interest followed by a poly(A) sequence of varying lengths. Assays such as measuring viral titre and further RNA-seq may be used to test the effects of these alterations after infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P45">Overall, by utilising three ONT RNA-seq methodologies, we generated an in-depth characterisation of differential expression, polyadenylation and differential transcript usage of cell lines infected <italic>in vitro</italic> by SARS-CoV-2.
