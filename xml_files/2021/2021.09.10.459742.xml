For example, for SARS-CoV-2, the elderly are often preferentially protected. For diseases of plants and animals, certain sub-populations can drive mitigation because they are intrinsically more valuable for ecological, economic, socio-cultural or political reasons. Here we use optimal control theory to identify strategies to optimally protect a “high value” sub-population when there is a limited budget and epidemiological uncertainty. We use protection of the Redwood National Park in California in the face of the large ongoing state-wide epidemic of sudden oak death (caused by <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>) as a case study. We concentrate on whether control should be focused entirely within the National Park itself, or whether treatment of the growing epidemic in the surrounding “buffer region” can instead be more profitable. We find that, depending on rates of infection and the size of the ongoing epidemic, focusing control on the high value region is often optimal. However, priority should sometimes switch from the buffer region to the high value region only as the local outbreak grows. We characterise how the timing of any switch depends on epidemiological and logistic parameters, and test robustness to systematic misspecification of these factors due to imperfect prior knowledge.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>optimal control theory</kwd><kwd>sudden oak death</kwd><kwd>Phytophthora ramorum</kwd><kwd>policy plot</kwd><kwd>buffer region</kwd><kwd>parameter uncertainty</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Management of emerging infectious disease is most likely to be successful when it starts as soon as possible. Smaller epidemics are easier and less expensive to control than the larger epidemics which would result if management were to be delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Althaus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Epanchin-Niell and Hastings, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Hoffman and Silverberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Longini et al., 2015</xref>). Sufficiently rapid intervention can even make eradication, or at least localised elimination, a realistic proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dowdle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Klepac et al., 2015</xref>). Our recent experience with COVID-19 provides an object lesson. Governments of some countries in the Asia-Pacific region took early and decisive action to introduce non-pharmaceutical interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pearce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Thompson et al., 2020b</xref>). Certain of these countries, perhaps most notably New Zealand, therefore appear to continue to be in a very good position to face the ongoing challenge of the global pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Summers et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, despite recent incursions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dyer, 2021</xref>), they seem better-placed than any other nation to enact the “Zero COVID” strategy based on prompt responses to any incursion, with no tolerance for community transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baker et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P3">However rapid responses are not always possible. Pathogens can become established in a host population without the diseases they cause being identified, particularly when effective surveillance systems are not in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carvajal-Yepes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Grogan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mastin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Ristaino et al., 2021</xref>) or if there is a long incubation period before symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Thompson et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Khan et al., 2020</xref>). Attempts to eliminate or eradicate are also not always successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Thompson et al., 2020a</xref>). If transmission is possible before – or perhaps even without – infected hosts showing symptoms, disease management is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Cunniffe et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cunniffe and Gilligan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>). Early in any outbreak it might also be unclear which controls or combinations of controls are likely to be most successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). Particularly for plant and animal pathogens, there are often also economic constraints which mean that extensive and costly management is simply not justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wilkinson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Strategies to effectively mitigate well-established outbreaks are therefore very important. Plant disease epidemics provide a pressing example. The impacts of plant pathogens on food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Strange and Scott, 2005</xref>) and ecosystem services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>) are well acknowledged. However, management of plant disease epidemics is very often a case of “too little too late” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tomlinson and Potter, 2010</xref>). For tree diseases, delays and/or deficiencies in detection have been implicated in high-profile failures of various large-scale control programs, including for chestnut blight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Freinkel, 1997</xref>), white pine blister rust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Maloy, 1997</xref>), Dutch elm disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tomlinson and Potter, 2010</xref>) and citrus canker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gottwald, 2007</xref>). Indeed, elimination is often not even attempted. For example, following the first detection of ash dieback (a disease of ash trees caused by the fungus <italic>Hymenoscyphus fraxineus</italic>) into the United Kingdom in late 2012, a consensus was rapidly formed that country-wide management was unlikely to succeed because the pathogen was already so widely-dispersed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Thomas, 2016</xref>). In Italy, control of olive quick decline syndrome (caused by the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic>) is based entirely on slowing the spread, with management and detection focused on “buffer” and “containment” zones bordering an “infected” zone within which the disease is, essentially, allowed to spread undetected and uncontrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH) et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We take control of sudden oak death in coastal forests of central California to southwestern Oregon, caused by the oomycete <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>, as an example of a well-established plant disease epidemic that still requires management. The generalist pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramorum</italic> affects over one hundred plant species, and broadly-speaking causes two kinds of disease in the area in question: “sudden oak death” on tanoaks and oaks (including coast live oak), and “ramorum blight” on a large number of species of woody shrubs and forest understorey plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Grünwald et al., 2019</xref>). Sudden oak death causes large bleeding cankers to form on the main stem of affected trees, eventually leading to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Rizzo et al., 2005</xref>). However, some species affected by ramorum blight, in California most notably bay laurel, are not killed by the infection. They therefore act as “spreader species” by supporting significant foliar sporulation over extended periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Grünwald et al., 2008</xref>). The pathogen spreads predominantly through short-distance rain splash dispersal of spores, but spores can be dispersed over longer distances by turbulent air currents, rivers and streams, or when carried by animals or human activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Grünwald et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P6">A very large sudden oak death epidemic has devastated coastal forests of central California to southwestern Oregon since its first detection in California in 1995, killing millions of oak (<italic>Quercus</italic> spp.) and tanoak (<italic>Notholithocarpus densiflorus</italic>) trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Meentemeyer et al., 2011</xref>). That epidemic is now very widespread, covering over 2000km<sup>2</sup> in California alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Grünwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Economic impacts are significant, with, for example, an estimated $135M USD loss in property values attributed to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kovacs et al., 2011</xref>). Recent large-scale modelling work has shown that successful control of sudden oak death in California is no longer possible, and indeed has been impossible for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P7">However, control of isolated outbreaks and localised management both remain firmly on the agenda. In 2001 a spatially-distinct epidemic was identified in Curry County, Oregon, and since then over $20 million USD has been spent on identifying and treating that localised epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Grünwald et al., 2019</xref>). There are also other areas ahead of the main epidemic front under active management, most notably a pair of relatively large outbreaks in Humboldt County, in California (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>; the southern border of Humboldt County is at a latitude of around 40°N). Although further south than the outbreak in Oregon, the outbreaks in Humboldt county are some distance “ahead” of the main bulk of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexander and Lee, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Disease management in Humboldt County exemplifies the challenges now posed by the control of sudden oak death. The goal is to design a management scheme that can effectively achieve a smaller, more local, objective than complete elimination or eradication. This could be, for example, slowing local rates of disease spread or protection of valuable resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cobb et al., 2013</xref>). This must be done when there is a limited budget available for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>). We focus here on strategies which reduce impacts of disease on a particular “high value” region, within which it is important to mitigate the effects of disease for ecological, economic, socio-cultural or political reasons.</p><p id="P9">For sudden oak death in California, any high value region would most obviously be defined in terms of an area with particular ecological and/or socio-cultural value. The host species that is most affected – tanoak – is not grown for its timber. Disease impacts therefore predominantly include deleterious effects upon carbon sequestration, fuel dynamics and cultural resources. However, direct economic effects due to sudden oak death have been documented in California, most notably effects on property values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kovacs et al., 2011</xref>). Effects on timber production are also relevant in other areas. For example, emerging <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramorum</italic> lineages in Oregon might also potentially threaten Douglas-fir silviculture. The epidemic caused by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramorum</italic> in the United Kingdom is most often known as “sudden larch death”, since the coniferous plantation species Japanese larch <italic>Larix kaempferi</italic> is predominantly affected in that context.</p><p id="P10">Although other controls such as chemical treatments have occasionally been promoted for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexander and Lee, 2010</xref>), and despite targeted prophylactic removal of certain host species sometimes being recommended as a potentially highly effective strategy to reduce risks of sudden oak death epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Swiecki and Bernhardt, 2013</xref>), there is a consensus that effective disease management at medium to large spatial scales must be based upon removal of infected hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Grünwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>). The only outbreak of sudden oak death that is actively being controlled across large spatial scales in the United States, in Curry County, Oregon, is certainly being managed in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore concentrate exclusively on this type of control here.</p><p id="P11">The particular example we select to motivate our analysis is based upon the Redwood Creek outbreak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This outbreak was detected in May 2010 through stream monitoring, with the disease found to be present in a stream near Orick, at the mouth of Redwood Creek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Valachovic et al., 2013</xref>). It was considered to be an outbreak of high significance due to its proximity to Redwood National Park as well as the traditional and reservation lands of the Yurok and Hoopa tribes, respectively. Extensive detection efforts were carried out to identify the source of the infection, which was located in Redwood Valley in July 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). Disease was also detected within the National Park within a few years of the initial incursion into Redwood Creek (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Treatment aiming to prevent further damage to Redwood National Park is ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Croucher et al., 2013</xref>). A pressing question is how limited control resources should be partitioned to protect the high value region, i.e. the Redwood National Park. The most obvious, and pressing, question is whether management resources should be entirely focused on treating within the high value region itself, or whether treatment of the growing epidemic in the surrounding areas can better serve the goal of protecting the National Park.</p><p id="P12">We show in principle how control strategies to protect the high-value region can be designed and tested using a mathematical model. The role of modelling in optimising decision making in disease control is now well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lofgren et al., 2014</xref>), including in plant health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cunniffe and Gilligan, 2020</xref>). Models offer a rational basis to decide where, when and how to control disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Cunniffe et al., 2015a</xref>). However, the conventional approach for testing interventions via models - comparing a relatively small number of pre-specified intervention strategies - necessarily risks sub-optimal performance, since only a small subset of all possible strategies can ever be tested in depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>). Recent work has shown how the search space of possible interventions can be unambiguously explored for plant diseases using optimal control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bokil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bussell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Dangerfield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hamelin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Ndeffo Mbah and Gilligan, 2010b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2011</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We concentrate here upon how optimal control theory can be used to solve the problem of prioritising different areas for disease management. Our analysis is a proof of concept, capturing the key features of the Redwood Creek outbreak of sudden oak death in a simple way. Indeed, while detailed models of this system are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>), here we instead concentrate on a rather general model, which in principle is applicable to many host-pathogen combinations. We test the performance of optimal control theory in optimising management in this model, performing extensive scans over different values of epidemiological and logistical parameters, ensuring a wide range of scenarios are captured. Since we deliberately phrase our mathematical model to omit many system specific details, our results therefore illustrate epidemiological principles important whenever a subset of host individuals must be protected in the face of a large, ongoing epidemic.</p><p id="P14">In particular we use optimal control theory to understand how time-dependent disease management can be optimised in order to protect a high value region at risk from a growing, spreading epidemic. We account for economic and logistical limitations in control by introducing a budgetary constraint such that only a finite number of infected hosts can be treated per unit time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ndeffo Mbah and Gilligan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Dangerfield et al., 2019</xref>). We then seek to understand how these finite resources for disease management should be partitioned, and whether and how the balance of control effort within <italic>versus</italic> outside the high value region changes over time and with the state of the epidemic. Management strategies as derived using optimal control theory can often be rather complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bussell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>). We therefore focus here on how optimal strategies can be characterised in an intuitive and understandable fashion. This would be a precondition of implementation by local managers and other stakeholders. We also use our model to understand how optimal management strategies would be affected by alterations to, or imprecision in our knowledge of, epidemiological and/or logistic parameters, commonly the case in tackling an emerging epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Epidemiological model</title><p id="P15">We split the host landscape into three disjoint regions: a generally infested area in which the disease is already well-established, a buffer region in which the disease might perhaps be present, but has not yet become established, and a high value region that is currently entirely uninfected and that must be protected. In the context of Redwood Creek and sudden oak death, the generally infested area would correspond to the large epidemic across large parts of California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexander and Lee, 2010</xref>), the buffer region would be the recently-infected forests of the Redwood Creek watershed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Stark et al., 2014</xref>), and the high value region would be the Redwood National Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Croucher et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). To reduce the number of state variables and parameters in our model, we simplify the epidemic in the generally infested area such that it is represented as a source of external inoculum, generating a constant force of infection upon the buffer region (in general the “force of infection” is the per capita rate at which susceptible hosts become infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Keeling and Rohani, 2008</xref>); here we assume the component of this corresponding to the epidemic elsewhere remains constant over time). This simplification is valid when considering new, relatively isolated outbreaks of disease: a common situation for diseases such as sudden oak death that are spread over long distances through rare long-distance dispersal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Meentemeyer et al., 2011</xref>). As shown in electronic <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material, S1 text</xref>, the effects of even a growing rather than constant-sized external epidemic upon the dynamics within the region of interest can also often be subsumed into an appropriately time-averaged external force of infection. Since we scan over a range of values of the constant force of infection in the results we present, we consider the simplification we make to use only constant values of this parameter to therefore not be unduly restrictive.</p><p id="P16">The buffer and high value regions are modelled as well-mixed patches, meaning the only spatial component in our model is between-patch coupling. We use a (<italic>S</italic>)usceptible-(<italic>I</italic>)nfected-(<italic>R</italic>)emoved model for the epidemic dynamics in each patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Keeling and Rohani, 2008</xref>), in which hosts can be susceptible to the disease (<italic>S</italic>), infected and infectious (<italic>I</italic>), or removed (<italic>R</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). We assume that infection can potentially kill hosts, meaning an infected host can be removed either by disease-induced death or via disease control. Guided by the epidemiology of sudden oak death, for which standing dead trees are not considered to be a significant source of inoculum (particularly in comparison to foliar hosts which are not killed by infection) we assume that removed hosts cannot cause other hosts to become infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Rizzo et al., 2005</xref>). We seek to optimise management of the epidemic by determining time-dependent allocations of control resource to the buffer and high value regions, treating a time-varying proportion of the infected hosts in each region. This control, which for plant pathogens is often known as “roguing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Cunniffe et al., 2014</xref>), is therefore the only form of disease management we allow for in our model.</p><p id="P17">Each patch has a particular fixed population size (<italic>N<sub>B</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>V</sub></italic> for the buffer and high value regions, respectively), and the two patches are linked for transmission, symmetrically, by a coupling constant <italic>ϵ</italic>.

This is exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(e)</xref>, which shows that even for this parameterisation, the force of infection upon the high value region from itself remains smaller than that from the buffer region throughout the epidemic, despite the switch in focus of the optimal control at <italic>t</italic> ≈ 6 units of time.</p><p id="P30">Further switches, i.e. multiple changes in focus between the two regions, can occur whilst budgets are not limiting.

However, as the rate of invasion of the buffer is increased, through either more initial infection or via a higher external force of infection, the range of infection rates over which a switching strategy is optimal decreases. For sufficiently high rates of invasion in the buffer region(i.e. moving up the <italic>y</italic> axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5a,b</xref>) a switching strategy becomes sub-optimal, because the disease spreads faster in the buffer, and so control is less effective there than in the high value region.</p><p id="P37">The particular shapes of the responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5a,b</xref> are affected by where the maximum expenditure rate becomes limiting, with the budget becoming more constraining towards the upper right corners.

Note that for some values of the external force of infection, optimal strategies with additional switches are found; these are the grey regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>.

In case C there is an additional switch early in the epidemic, but since the budget is not limiting at that point it has no effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Optimal strategies can be robust to model misspecification, but requires some prior knowledge of transmission dynamics</title><p id="P39">Finally, we test how these optimal strategies perform when the parameters controlling the underlying model are not known accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). We do this by introducing a systematic error into the infection rate of the model used to optimise the control strategy, varying the value of <italic>β</italic> from 50% smaller to 50% larger than the “true” value. The resulting optimal control specifies an expenditure over time (<italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) for each region) which is applied to a model with the “true” infection rate. Large errors in the infection rate lead to worse control of the epidemic. It is also important to note that for large underestimates of the infection rate, the optimised control is worse than simply allocating the full budget to the high value region, with no treatment in the buffer region. The optimised control strategies lead to wasted resources that could be better allocated to the other region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(b,c)</xref>). These results suggest that if prior knowledge of parameters controlling transmission is imprecise, simpler control strategies might be better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Hyatt-Twynam et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">Landscape scale control of sudden oak death in California has not been possible for some years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cunniffe et al., 2016</xref>). However highly valuable sub-populations at risk due to the epidemic – such as areas important for tourism or cultural reasons, or for ecological reasons to conserve biodiversity – might yet be protected. Slowing spread to these regions is itself valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cobb et al., 2013</xref>). An obvious question is then how this goal can best be achieved. This requires partitioning limited resources for disease management between the population of particular interest and the growing epidemic elsewhere, and determining whether this partitioning should vary with time and with the current state of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rowthorn et al., 2009</xref>). This must be done in a situation in which different sets of stakeholders have different objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Craig et al., 2018</xref>), but must nevertheless work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Laranjeira et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We used the outbreak of sudden oak death in Humboldt County, California to motivate our work. After developing a simple mathematical model representing disease within the “high value” region of the Redwood National Park and in a “buffer” region surrounding it, we used optimal control theory to find the most effective time-varying allocation of a limited budget for disease management between these two regions. To minimise the final amount of infection in the National Park, we found it is very often better to prioritise exclusively that area for treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, while it is clearly very intuitive, we have identified that this strategy is not always optimal. It can instead be better to start by prioritising disease control in the buffer region, and only to switch to prioritising the high value region later in the epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We have found that such a “switching” strategy is most likely to be optimal for intermediate values of the infection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P42">This type of policy involving switching attention from reducing a long term threat to focusing on short term gains has been identified before.

(2006)</xref> used a class-structured model to investigate control of <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> (an invasive species of deciduous grass) in Willapa Bay, Washington. The key prediction was that early control within each season should preferentially remove plants from the class with the highest reproductive value, only shifting later to remove plants that contribute most to the next season’s population. Similar switching strategies have also been found in other studies relating to management of invasive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carrasco et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Switching strategies have also been identified in other epidemiological models. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ndeffo Mbah and Gilligan (2011)</xref> found that disease management across sub-populations is most efficient when resources are first allocated to whichever group is more infected, and later switching to treat the less infected group.

Switching strategies have also been found for distribution of prophylactic vaccines in a spatially structured population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Keeling and Shattock, 2012</xref>), and switching between immunisation and palliative care during an epidemic when resources are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Klepac et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P44">For the simple model we considered here, the optimal strategies could in fact probably have been identified by an exhaustive scan over switching times. However for more complex models with more complex switching strategies this will not generally be true. Whilst the setting was highly simplified, we can already begin to see some of the potential limitations of these more complex strategies for practical use. Although not included in our analysis, there are additional costs associated with changing policy during an epidemic, i.e. switching region priorities, and these costs must be balanced with the benefit to epidemic control. These costs could be included in the objective function as optimised, for example by adding a term penalising rapidly changing controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Direct use of optimal control theory also facilitated the extensive scans over alternative parameterisations of our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), allowing our relatively intuitive characterisation of a number of outcomes based on which region is prioritised. Although some work in optimal control of plant disease does translate strategies for practical application, and consider the impact of parameters (e.g.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hamelin et al., 2021</xref>)), more often results are presented for a single parameterisation and tend not to focus on the practical implementability of the strategies that result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bokil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Basir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Basir and Ray, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chen-Charpentier and Jackson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alemneh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P46">We have also shown how imprecision in knowledge of parameters controlling disease spread can lead to less effective disease management (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

Consideration of parameter uncertainty when determining the optimal strategy is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Epanchin-Niell and Hastings, 2010b</xref>). The type of control strategy identified here, a bang-bang switching control, can be particularly sensitive to precise knowledge about the optimal switch time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Forster and Gilligan (2007)</xref> showed that when applying control optimised using a mean-field model of an epidemic to a spatially-explicit model, errors in the switch time can lead to performance that is worse than a simple constant strategy. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carrasco et al. (2009)</xref> showed that when controlling invasive species, the optimal strategy when parameters are known precisely is not always optimal when parameter uncertainty is introduced. This also echoes results from so-called “risk-based” control strategies, which attempt to use additional epidemiological information to develop precise control strategies. When knowledge is limited simpler control strategies are very likely to be more appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Hyatt-Twynam et al., 2017</xref>)</p><p id="P47">While here we have focused on the particular example of sudden oak death, we note our model is sufficiently abstract that, at least in principle, it could apply in other settings. Control by artificially shortening hosts’ infectious period could correspond to, for example, antibiotic treatment of agricultural animals, or encouraging individuals to self-isolate following symptoms of human respiratory diseases. Analogous problems in which a particular region or sub-population must be protected in the face of a ongoing epidemic also arise rather naturally for other pathosystems. For example, for COVID-19 in Western Europe, an obvious focus before the effects of vaccination became apparent lay in reducing numbers of infections of elderly residents of care facilities, since older individuals tend to suffer much worse outcomes following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Palmer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P48">We concentrated here upon only the relative amounts of one single control – i.e. removing infected hosts – in each of our two regions. For sudden oak death, a number of other management strategies are sometimes recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Swiecki and Bernhardt, 2013</xref>), and these were not included in our model. In particular, we did not consider pre-emptive removal of “spreader” host species such as California bay laurel that drive local epidemics. Such “thinning” is well-acknowledged to reduce the risk of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramorum</italic> infection entering an individual stand, or the rate at which it spreads following invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>). Our main motivation to only consider a single control strategy was simplicity: two distinct controls (i.e. reactive removal of infected hosts and pre-emptive removal of healthy hosts) would immediately double the complexity of the optimization problem (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD5">Equation 2</xref>). It would also increase, perhaps significantly, the complexity of the optimal strategies that would need to be interpreted. We also note that preemptive removal of healthy hosts is somewhat specific to plant diseases in natural environments and so including it here would dilute the generic nature of our study. Finally, species-specific host removal rates would be difficult to represent in the type of model used here, in which all potentially infected species are amalgamated into a single category of “hosts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Meentemeyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Thompson et al., 2016a</xref>). However, we note preemptive removal of certain host species has been included in more detailed system-specific models of sudden oak death in particular, including our own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>), and (perhaps unsurprisingly) suggest the focus of control should switch from preemptive to reactive treatments as any local epidemic becomes larger.</p><p id="P49">This paper is intended to be an illustrative analysis, highlighting the epidemiological principles at play when protecting a valuable sub-population in the face of an otherwise unmitigated epidemic. We therefore deliberately simplified the wide range of management strategies available for sudden oak death, and instead concentrated in detail on a single type of management, i.e. removing infected hosts. However this was sufficient for us to show that the obvious benefit of direct treatment of the most valuable region might be outweighed by the delayed benefit from treating elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rowthorn et al., 2009</xref>). However, as illustrated by our analysis, the optimal strategy depends on the complex interplay between the epidemiological parameters, the level of precision with which these parameters are known, the budget available for control and the current state of the epidemic. For practical application, our model would need to be extended to more faithfully capture sudden oak death epidemiology, for which cryptic infection, long-distance dispersal, epidemiological differences between different host species, spatial structure, alternate control strategies and stochasticity are all likely to be important. Given that, at least under some circumstances, the cost of protecting the high-value region is felt by stakeholders elsewhere, accounting for stakeholder behaviour could also be an interesting extension to the modelling work presented here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Milne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Murray-Watson et al., 2021</xref>). However recent work has shown how insights derived via optimal control theory could nevertheless potentially be applied irrespective of any or all of these complexities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bussell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bussell and Cunniffe, 2020</xref>). By showing how non-intuitive control strategies might arise from such an exercise, the key contribution of this paper is to develop a framework for identifying broad categories of control strategy to further investigate in such a setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material S1 Text</label><media xlink:href="EMS134871-supplement-Supplementary_Material_S1_Text.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jane White and Olivier Restif, the examiners of the PhD thesis upon which this paper is based, for useful discussions of the work.</p><sec id="S18"><title>Funding</title><p>E.H.B. acknowledges support from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom (BBSRC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bbsrc.ukri.org/">https://bbsrc.ukri.org/</ext-link>) via a University of Cambridge DTP PhD studentship (Project Reference 1643594).</p></sec></ack><sec id="S19" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Accessibility</title><p>A reference implementation of our underlying model and optimisation procedure is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ehbussell/PatchOptimalControl">https://github.com/ehbussell/PatchOptimalControl</ext-link>.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P50"><bold>Author Contributions</bold></p><p id="P51">E.H.B. and N.J.C. designed the study, E.H.B. conducted the analysis and wrote the initial draft of the manuscript.
