<abstract>
<p id="P1">T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are critical for antiviral immunity. Determining the TCR repertoires composition, diversity, and dynamics and how they change during viral infection can inform the molecular specificity of viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2. To determine signatures associated with COVID-19 disease severity, here we performed a large-scale analysis of over 4.7 billion sequences across 2,130 TCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors. TCR repertoire analyses from these data identified and characterized convergent COVID-19 associated CDR3 gene usages, specificity groups, and sequence patterns. T cell clonal expansion was found to be associated with upregulation of T cell effector function, TCR signaling, NF-kB signaling, and Interferon-gamma signaling pathways. Machine learning approaches accurately predicted disease severity for patients based on TCR sequence features, with certain high-power models reaching near-perfect AUROC scores across various predictor permutations. These analyses provided an integrative, systems immunology view of T cell adaptive immune responses to COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Much of the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination strategies have focused on targeting B cells for eliciting neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. However, SARS-CoV-2 nAb levels after infection or vaccination have been found to decrease over time <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, and recently emerging variants of concern (VOC) have been associated with antibody escape <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Strategies that solely focus on nAbs may not be sufficient for managing the pandemic in the long term. There has therefore been increasing interest in studying the role of T cell immunity in the response to COVID-19 infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Functional T cell responses are crucial for control and clearance of many respiratory viral infections <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, including for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Studies from transgenic mouse models suggest that T cells are also important for disease resolution after infection with SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells have been associated with milder disease in human patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, suggesting roles for coordinated adaptive immune responses in protective immunity against COVID-19. T cells contribute to viral control through numerous mechanisms, including supporting the generation of antibody-producing plasma cells (T follicular helper cells), production of effector cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF, and cytotoxicity against infected cells. Generation of memory T cells can provide life-long protection against pathogens <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, and a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses were sustained for 10 months in COVID-19 convalescent patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs rarely escape T reactivity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>, perhaps in part due to a wider distribution of T cell epitopes across the entire viral proteome unlike nAb target limitation to the viral surface. Due to the importance of T cells in long-term and broad immune reactivity, there has been an increase in diverse vaccine strategies to expand targets beyond the spike protein and induce T cell responses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">T cells recognize viral antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules through an enormously diverse assembly of T cell receptors (TCRs) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Ligation of the TCR by peptide-loaded MHC molecules leads to T cell activation and clonal expansion, causing a shift in repertoire specificity towards the antigen. TCR repertoires therefore represent a functional signature of the adaptive immune response. The development of high-throughput DNA sequencing methods has enabled highly quantitative investigation into the diversity and composition of immune repertoires <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>; for example, one study used TCR sequencing (TCR-seq) on samples from T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma patients to reveal the receptor profiles of clonal T lymphoblast populations and then further to develop a clinical assay for diagnosis of minimal residual disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Other studies have used tracking of TCR repertoires in cancer patients over time to identify correlations between clonal dynamics and clinical features such as immunotherapy treatment response <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. TCR-seq data has enormous potential for gaining quantitative insight into the patterns of adaptive immune responses, which has been particularly well demonstrated in studies for cancer immunology.</p>
<p id="P5">We sought to develop an integrative, systems immunology approach for investigating TCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients to help decode patterns of the adaptive immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. While there have been some preliminary studies on different aspects of TCR-seq analysis for COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, there have been limited studies that incorporate motif-based analysis, transcriptomics, and machine learning in a large-scale, comprehensive investigation into the immune responses during disease course of varying severity. We anticipate that our approach here can provide sets of COVID-19 associated sequences and motifs that may help guide development of prognostic and diagnostic markers and potentially help design therapeutic interventions that better harness the power of T cell immunity.</p>

<title>TCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors reveal trends in CDR3 gene usage and diversity</title>
<p id="P6">To determine if there were any global patterns that distinguish the immune repertoires of COVID-19 patients, we systematically compiled and analyzed TCR-seq samples (total n = 2130) from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). TCR repertoire data was obtained from studies by Adaptive Biotechnologies (AB, n = 1574), ISB-Swedish COVID-19 Biobanking Unit (ISB-S, n = 266), PLA General Hospital (PLAGH, n = 20), and Wuhan Hankou Hospital (WHH, n = 15), and then uniformly processed for downstream analysis (see <bold>Methods</bold>). Clonality analyses revealed that COVID-19 patient samples from the ISB-S CD4, ISB-S CD8, and WHH datasets had significantly fewer total unique clonotypes compared to healthy donor controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Moreover, repertoire diversity metrics including Chao1 estimators (measure of species richness), Gini-Simpson indices (probability of interspecific encounter), and inverse Simpson indices were significantly decreased for COVID-19 samples compared to healthy donor samples, notably for the AB, ISB-S CD4, and ISB-S CD8 datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). The decrease in clonal diversity measures is consistent with the increase in the relative abundance of the top clonotypes in the repertoire space for COVID-19 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3D</xref>), which suggests expansion of a small number of functional clones after antigen exposure. These results together reveal global shifts in immune repertoire clonality and diversity in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy donors.</p>
<p id="P7">To determine the specific gene usage preferences and dynamics in COVID-19 patients, we performed comparative analyses of V(D)J gene and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) gene usages for the AB and ISB-S datasets. While we observed some significant selective V and J gene usage differences in the AB dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D-E</xref>), fewer differences were found for the ISB-S CD4 and CD8 datasets when comparing samples from different disease severities to those from healthy donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A-D</xref>). Moreover, there were no differences in clonotype frequencies by CDR3 length across the datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1C</xref>). By comparison, the top CDR3 sequences were different across conditions for both the AB and ISB-S datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B</xref>). In order to identify COVID-19 associated CDR3 sequences that are conserved across disease conditions and datasets, we performed a series of set analyses using sequences above a proportion threshold (0.0001 for ISB-S samples, 0.00001 for AB samples) for each condition. We found that CDR3 sequences enriched in the mild, moderate, and severe disease condition samples from the COVID-19 patients had considerable overlap while having limited overlap with healthy donor samples for both the ISB-S CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and ISB-S CD8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) datasets. Moreover, we observe 42 conserved CDR3 sequences when comparing the union set of disease-associated CDR3 sequences for ISB-S CD4 samples, the union set of disease-associated CDR3 sequences for ISB-S CD8 samples, and COVID-19 CDR3 sequences for the AB samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). In order to determine enriched CDR3 sequences for each dataset and disease conditions, we plotted the difference in mean CDR3 proportions between samples of interest and healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E-J</xref>). Although the identified sequences may not be definitively specific, we provide here a set of systematically processed COVID-19 associated convergent and enriched CDR3 gene usages.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>K-mer and motif analyses reveal patterns associated with disease conditions</title>
<p id="P8">Sequence convergence of immune repertoires can be also occur at the level of motifs, or sequence substrings, in addition to that of clones. One approach to decomposing CDR3 sequences into motifs is by using overlapping k-mers, or amino acid sequences of length k, which provide a functional representation of the repertoires with increased compatibility for statistical analyses and machine learning methods <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. We created 3-mer, 4-mer, 5-mer, and 6-mer frequency matrix representations of ISB-S CD4 and CD8 datasets and performed principal components analysis to see whether samples cluster by disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A, 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A-F</xref>). We found that while the majority of samples clustered together, a number of mild and moderate samples were separated from the main cluster across all analysis permutations, while severe samples are generally associated with the main cluster of samples including healthy donors. These results are consistent emerging data that patients with severe COVID-19 have substantial immune dysregulation in comparison to those with less severe disease. Studies have shown that T cell polyfunctionality is increased in patients with moderate disease but reduced in those with severe disease <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, and there have been proposed models of TCR clonality whereby the response in mild disease includes detection of dominant clones while response in severe disease do not <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, heatmaps of 3-mer abundances reveal some shared motifs between mild and moderate samples such as YNE, NEQ, EQF, and QFF for repertoires sampled from the ISB-S CD4 dataset and TEA, EAF, and AFF for repertoires sampled from the ISB-S CD8 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B, 2D</xref>). These results in aggregate suggest that there are sequence features that distinguish COVID-19 TCR repertoires from healthy donors to various degrees based on disease condition.</p>
<p id="P9">Recent sequence similarity approaches have been developed to determine TCR specificity clusters for motif-based prediction of antigen specificity and identification of key conserved residues that drive TCR recognition <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. We used the Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions by Paratope Hotspots version 2 (GLIPH2) algorithm <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> to cluster the TCR sequences based on predicted antigen specificity for significant motifs associated with different disease conditions in the ISB-S datasets. We also used the Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin Amino-acid sequences (OLGA) algorithm <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> to calculate the generation probability (pGen) of the clonotypes contained in the clusters identified from the GLIPH2 analysis. Low pGen clonotypes are considered private and not shared widely in the population, while high pGen clonotypes are considered public and shared in a large proportion of the population due to convergent recombination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. We found that the mild and moderate disease conditions had both relatively lower pGen scores and higher median frequency clusters compared to the severe disease and healthy donor conditions for both the ISB-S CD4 and CD8 datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4G</xref>). Visualization of individual clusters revealed that the mild and moderate disease conditions had clonotypes with the highest proportional representation, including motifs AGQGA%E, S%AAG, SL%AG, and SLQGA%YE (the % character corresponds to a wildcard amino acid) for the ISB-S CD4 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) and motifs SEG%NTDT, SLDSGGA%E, SL%SGGANE, SLAA% for the ISB-S CD8 dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4H</xref>). In order to identify clusters that were exclusive to COVID-19 patients in the ISB-S CD4 dataset, we performed set analysis and found 677 clusters in the intersection of the disease conditions, 474 of which were exclusive and had no overlap with the healthy donor clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G-H</xref>). For the ISB-S CD8 dataset, we found 51 consensus clusters, 35 of which were exclusive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4I-J</xref>). We provide here all identified clusters and motifs with associated CDR3 sequences, V gene usage, and J gene usages, along with clonotype pGen scores and the identified COVID-19 associated clusters.</p>

<title>Transcriptional signatures of clonal expansion and associations with disease severity</title>
<p id="P10">In order to investigate the relationship between the enriched clonotypes and their transcriptomes, we performed dimensionality reduction on 137,075 CD4 T cell single cell RNA sequencing samples that had CDR3 sequences associated with identified GLIPH2 clusters. The transcriptomes were projected to a two dimensional space by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). Clustering was performed using the Louvain algorithm, revealing 12 clusters with differentially expressed gene signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C</xref>). We found that cluster 6 contained cells with high degrees of clonality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B</xref>), suggesting phenotypic correlates of clonal expansion. Comparison with the top enriched motifs found from the GLIPH2 analysis, including AGQGA%E, S%AAG, SL%AG, SLQGA%YE, S%SGTDT, SL%GTDT, SLS%TDT, and S%AGNQP revealed high density of clusters in cluster 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Moreover, we found a correlation between clonotype expansion and disease severity, with cells from COVID-19 patients exhibiting the highest density in effector phenotype associated cluster 6, while healthy donor cells exhibiting density in the naïve phenotype associated clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also found a higher association of lower pGen score, or private, clonotypes with cluster 6 compared to the high pGen score clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that these clones may be specific. However, comparison of the proportion of cells for each disease condition in cluster 6 with healthy donors revealed statistically significant cell proportion increases only for the moderate condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), despite increasing trends for all conditions. Altogether, these results demonstrate relationships between clonal expansion, disease severity, and cell phenotype, which can be extended to subsequence motifs.</p>
<p id="P11">We extended this analysis to the CD8 dataset to see if the associations between clonal expansion and disease severity are maintained. UMAP projection of 70,237 CD8 T cell single cell transcriptomes and clustering revealed 15 clusters with differentially expressed gene signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6C</xref>). As with the CD4 dataset, we found clustering of cells with high degrees of clonality, distributed here across the clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14 (grouped together as “Expanded” for further analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>). We also found high density of top enriched GLIPH2 motifs in the Expanded group, including SEG%NTDT, SLDSGGA%E, SL%SGGANE, SLAA%, SQT%STDT, SP%SGSYE, SPGT%GYNE, and S%RQGAGGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4H</xref>). We observe a relatively higher density of cells from COVID-19 disease conditions in the Expanded group as compared to the healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>), with low density of disease-associated cells in the non-Expanded clusters. Likewise, we found a more exclusive association between lower pGen score clonotypes and the Expanded group, particularly cluster 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D</xref>). Comparison of the proportion of cells for each disease condition in the Expanded group with healthy donors reveal statistically significant cell proportion increases for all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results highlight the relationship between clonal expansion and disease severity comparable with those from the CD4 dataset.</p>
<p id="P12">To investigate the gene expression changes that occur with clonal expansion, we performed differential expression (DEX) analysis between cluster 6 cells versus all other cells for the CD4 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) and the Expanded group cells versus all other cells for the CD8 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Using a threshold of q-value &lt; 1e-4, we found 512 downregulated genes and 959 upregulated genes for the CD4 T cell DEX, as well as 600 downregulated genes and 859 upregulated genes for the CD8 T cell DEX. Volcano plots for both T cell types revealed upregulation of cytotoxicity associated transcripts such as granzymes and granulysin and downregulation of naïve phenotype associated markers such as TCF7 and LEF1. Comparison of UMAPs of the individual subpopulation phenotype markers also showed correlation between cluster 6 or the Expanded group clusters and effector-related markers such as GZMA, PRF1, NKG7, and GNLY, with downregulation of naïve-related markers such as TCF7 and LEF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6D</xref>). Functional gene annotation analysis with DAVID <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> revealed enriched pathways terms such as TCR signaling pathway, regulation of immune response, NF-kB signaling, IFN-gamma mediated signaling, and TNF-mediated signaling pathways were upregulated in clonally expanded clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3H, 4H</xref>) while terms such as translational initiation, viral transcription, translation, and ribosomal subunit assembly were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) for both CD4 and CD8 differential expression analyses. We therefore find that clonally expanded CDR3 sequences and motifs are highly associated with effector T cell phenotypes at both the individual gene and functional pathway levels, while downregulating a number of mRNA processing related programs.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Machine learning models for disease severity</title>
<p id="P13">To determine whether the constitutive sequence motifs in the CDR3 sequence of the TCR contain sufficient information to be predictive of disease severity in COVID-19 infection, we trained several classical supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms on the repertoires from the ISB-S CD4 and CD8 datasets. We implemented Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosting Classifiers (GBC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on frequency matrices of overlapping 3-mer or 6-mer amino acids adapted from the TCR repertoires. ML models were trained as binary classification tasks to predict mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 TCR repertoires from healthy donor repertoires for either CD4 or CD8 ISB-S datasets. Training and testing partitions were created as five randomly sampled folds, with models trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. This process was repeated 100 times for each fold (500 repetitions per model per classification permutation) for statistical power. We found that RFs, GBCs and SVMs had particularly strong classification performance across the board, with average AUROCs greater than 0.90 for all permutations, with certain predictors approaching perfect score (AUROCs = 0.99 – 1.00) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <bold>7A</bold>), as compared to NBs or KNNs. Notably, the ML models had higher performance for classifying mild and moderate repertoires than severe repertoire regardless of k-mer or T cell type. This is consistent with the increased separation of the mild and moderate repertoires observed in the PCA analysis. Overall, these results demonstrate that ML-based methods are capable of identifying samples with high performance from COVID-19 patients of varying severity based on CDR3 sequences features, particularly for mild and moderate disease conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">T cells are increasingly being recognized as key mediators of viral clearance and host protection in COVID-19, and are subjects of active investigation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. However, the rules governing SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell specificity are still incompletely understood. We provide here a comprehensive, systems immunology approach to analyzing COVID-19 TCR repertoires to discover these rules in an unbiased and systematic manner. By uniformly processing immune sequencing data from multiple cohorts with TCR-seq data, we found that antigen exposure during the course of COVID-19 significantly decreased the diversity of repertoires and reshaped clonal representation. We identified and characterized enriched CDR3 sequences, k-mer motifs, and patterns associated with disease severity, and found convergent CDR3 gene usages and clusters that have potential for clonal tracking studies. Comparison of COVID-19 associated motifs and single T cell transcriptomes revealed associations between clonal expansion, disease severity, and cell phenotypes such as effector T cell function. Finally, we established several ML methods for predicting disease severity from TCR repertoires, demonstrating high performance for several models and the potential of using ML for prognostication in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p id="P15">Recent studies have started to report on the differences between T cell responses during mild and more severe COVID-19 disease course. Notably, severe COVID-19, albeit having increases in activated effector cell populations as seen with other disease severities, is associated with lymphopenia and profound functional impairment of CD4 and CD8 T cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. These results are consistent with our PCA and motif analyses, we observe a stronger signal for the mild and moderate disease repertoires distinguishing them from healthy donors as compared to severe disease repertoires. Moreover, our ML-based methods had higher performance for predicting mild and moderate repertoires, further demonstrating that CDR3 sequence and subsequence features for these disease conditions have higher discriminative capacity than for severe conditions. Nevertheless, all of the disease conditions were well differentiated from healthy donors across all analyses suggesting that consensus disease-associated features can be identified, including correlations between clonal expansion in the setting of COVID-19 with effector T cell functions at the transcriptomic level.</p>
<p id="P16">To our knowledge this is the largest scale investigation into TCR specificity groups for COVID-19 to date, spanning 4,730,447,888 clones across 2,130 repertoires. Though many studies have sought to identify factors predictive of COVID-19 clinical course and outcomes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, few have leveraged TCR-seq data and adaptive immune profiles to their full capacity. We provide high confidence convergent COVID-19 associated signatures with potential prognostic value, including successful implementation of machine learning models for predicting disease severity. The use of next-generation sequencing of immune repertoires provides deeper and more quantitative understanding of the adaptive immune response to COVID-19, and may guide patient risk stratification, vaccine design, and improved clinical management.</p>

<p id="P18">All TCR-seq data was pre-processed for standardized analysis with Immunarch v0.6.6 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Data obtained from the Adaptive Biotechnologies ImmuneCODE database were used directly as inputs for Immunarch processing, with 1,475 COVID-19 patient samples and 88 healthy donor patient samples (1,563 samples total) successfully loaded and used for further analysis. For the ISB-Swedish cohort, patients were first filtered by those were sequenced by 10X Genomics. Sequence filtering and processing was performed as follows: for cells with multiple TRA and TRB CDR3 sequences, the first instance respectively were selected; only cells with paired TRA and TRB sequences were kept (column chain_pairing = Single pair, Extra alpha, Extra beta or Two chains); sequence files were converted to VDJtools format for input into Immunarch. COVID severity scores were translated from the WHO Ordinal Scale (0-7) to four tiers: healthy donor (0), mild (1-2), moderate (3-4), and severe (5-7). After pre-processing, the CD4 and CD8 datasets were composed of 136,429 and 69,687 clones, represented in a total of 16 healthy donors, 61 mild, 42 moderate, and 24 severe patients, 143 individuals total (16 healthy donors, 108 mild, 93 moderate, and 49 severe repertoires when accounting for patients with samples from two time points, 266 samples total). For the PLA General Hospital and Wuhan Hankou Hospital China cohort, cells with more than one TRA or TRB sequence had the chain with the highest number of reads kept for further analysis and sequence files were converted to VDJTools format for input into Immunarch. The PLA General Hospital aggregated patient dataset contained 31951 clones across 3 healthy donors (two healthy donors from the original study were excluded for lack of TCR CDR3 amino acid data), 7 moderate, 4 severe, and 6 convalescent patients (of which 4 were the second time point collections of moderate patients – P01, P02, P03, and P04). The Wuhan Hankou Hospital China aggregated patient dataset contained 42001 clones across 5 healthy donors, 5 moderate, and 5 severe patients.

<title>Training and evaluation of machine learning models</title>
<p id="P23">Five ML-based approaches were trained on the k-mer frequency matrix generated from amino acids in the CDR3 region in the T cell repertoires of healthy donor and COVID-19 patients from the ISB-S datasets, using Python v3.8.6 and scikit-learn v0.23.1. These algorithms were: Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosting Classifiers (GBC) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The k-mer frequency matrix dataset was partitioned into subsets to perform binary classification between the healthy donor and the specified disease phenotype, such that models were trained for distinct classification tasks: healthy donor vs. mild disease, healthy donor vs. moderate disease, and healthy donor vs. severe disease. To address imbalanced datasets, healthy donor samples were upsampled to be equal to the number of COVID-19 samples represented in the dataset, prior to training. RFs were trained with 100 estimators, gini impurity criterion for measuring the quality of splits, minimum samples required to split an internal node of 2, minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node of 1, and bootstrapping to build trees. SVCs were trained with polynomial kernel and parameters C=20, degree=5, and probability=True. NBs were trained with default settings. GBCs were trained with 100 estimators, learning rate of 1.0 and maximum depth of 1. KNNs were trained with leaf size of 30 and the minkowski distance metric. Estimators were trained and evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation, using 80% of the data for training and 20% of the data for validation, which was performed with 100 repetitions using the RepeatedStratifiedKFold function from sklearn. Plotly v5.1.0 was used to generate ROC plots from performance results.</p>

<p>
<bold>(C)</bold> Boxplot of Gini-Simpson indices for COVID-19 patients and healthy donors for each repertoire dataset. P-values were obtained using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p>
<p>
<bold>(D)</bold> Bar plots showing the top 15 mean CDR3 usages for patients in the ISB-S CD4 dataset grouped by disease severity (healthy donor = 16, mild = 108, moderate = 93, severe = 49).</p>
<p>
<bold>(E)</bold> Venn diagram showing overlap of top mean CDR3 usages (proportion threshold = 0.0001) for patients in the ISB-S CD4 dataset grouped by disease severity.</p>
<p>
<bold>(F)</bold> Bar plot depicting relative abundance for groups of top clonotypes for sampled repertoires (healthy donors = 32, COVID-19 = 32) from AB dataset.</p>
<p>
<bold>(G)</bold> Dotted waterfall plot of CDR3 gene usage differentials between COVID-19 patients and healthy donors (delta mean proportion) in AB dataset. Purple dots are CDR3 sequences enriched in COVID-19; light blue dots are CDR3 sequences enriched in healthy donors; grey dots are all other CDR3 sequences.</p>
<p>
<bold>(H)</bold> Venn diagram showing overlap of COVID-19 enriched CDR3 sequences for patients in the ISB-S CD4, ISB-S CD8, and AB datasets (thresholds 0.0001 for ISB-S samples, 0.00001 for AB samples). P-values for overlap significance calculated using hypergeometric test.</p>

<title>Predictive performance of machine learning models for disease severity.</title>
<p>
<bold>(A)</bold> AUROC curves for five machine learning models (gradient boosting trees, support vector machines, random forests, Naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors) using 3-mer representations of TCR repertoire data. Models were trained to predict disease severity (mild, moderate, severe) vs healthy donors for CD4 (top row) and CD8 (bottom row) samples. Training and evaluation was performed using 100 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validations per model, average performance +/- 1 standard deviation shown on individual plots.</p>
