The ventral hippocampus is a brain region crucial for differentiating optimal behaviour across different contexts, but how internal context such as hunger influence hippocampal circuits to define behaviour is not known. Pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus, including the ventral CA1/subiculum border (vS) express the receptor for the peripheral hunger hormone ghrelin, and ghrelin is known to cross the blood brain barrier and directly influence hippocampal circuitry. But how ghrelin influences vS has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics and <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging in mice to investigate the role of vS during feeding behaviour across different states of hunger. We found that activity of a unique subpopulation of vS neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (vS-NAc) increased when animals approached and investigated food, and this activity inhibited the transition to begin eating. Increases in peripheral ghrelin reduced vS-NAc activity during this anticipatory phase of feeding behaviour by increasing the postsynaptic influence of inhibition, and promoted the initiation of eating. Furthermore, this peripheral ghrelin-induced inhibition required postsynaptic expression of the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a in vS-NAc neurons, and removal of GHSR1a from vS-NAc neurons impaired ghrelin-induced changes in feeding-related behaviour. Together, these experiments define a ghrelin-sensitive hippocampal circuit that informs the decision to eat based on internal state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Animals must be able to control feeding behaviour dependent on need. Consuming food when already sated utilises time and energy that could be spent on more essential functions, and can result in disease and disorders associated with overeating. In contrast, being unable to sense the need for food – or ‘hunger’ - can result in undereating, and resultant lack of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Toates, 1981</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A key aspect of this process is the ability to integrate external cues with internal state such as hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benoit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Toates, 1981</xref>). This is because the value of a given food cue is ambiguous - the same food would predict a rewarding post ingestive outcome when the animal is hungry, but not when the animal is sated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>). In this framework, hunger can act as a context upon which the optimal behaviour towards sensory cues is interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Davidson and Jarrard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gershman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rudy and Sutherland, 1995</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The hippocampus, and particularly its output area the ventral CA1 / subiculum (vS) – has been repeatedly proposed as a crucial structure for defining behaviour dependent on context, most notably in spatial contextual associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Good and Honey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Holland and Bouton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Per Andersen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). However, the hippocampus is also heavily involved in hunger sensing, in both humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Davidson and Jarrard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that in addition to spatial context, the hippocampus may also differentiate behaviour dependent on other, more abstract contexts such as hunger. Consistent with this idea, hippocampal activity is extremely sensitive to hunger state in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kennedy and Shapiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Min et al., 2011</xref>), and inactivation and dysfunction of the hippocampus leads to impaired hunger-based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Davidson and Jarrard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hebben et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rozin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In keeping with the hippocampus’ role in responding to internal state, hippocampal pyramidal neurons express a diverse array of physiologically important receptors, for example, those involved in the signalling axes for stress, hunger and thirst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lathe, 2001</xref>). More specifically to hunger, the hippocampus expresses the receptor for the peripheral hunger hormone ghrelin (GHSR1a) in both rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Zigman et al., 2006</xref>) and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Mitchell et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, many peripherally circulating hormones are able to gain access to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hamasaki et al., 2020</xref>), and there is evidence to support the entry of peripheral ghrelin into the hippocampus through the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Banks et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Furness et al., 2011</xref>). Once present in the hippocampus, ghrelin is capable of not only inducing structural and functional plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>), but also influencing anticipatory behaviour and influencing choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">However, while it is clear that motivational state affects hippocampal processing, and hippocampal dysfunction impairs hunger dependent behaviour, how hippocampal circuitry directly influences internal state dependent feeding behaviour, and the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying this ability remains unknown. This is compounded by the fact that vS is composed of multiple, non-overlapping and functionally distinct parallel projections to distinct downstream areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sánchez-Bellot et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). For example, neurons in vS that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been shown to preferentially represent and control motivation and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>), to be preferentially active during anticipatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>), and inhibited upon eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, a separate population of neurons projecting to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) has been shown to be recruited during salient environments and during learning of food associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>). Both of these populations of neurons are therefore well placed to control anticipatory feeding related behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>). However, how these populations are uniquely used during feeding behaviour, and how they are influenced by internal state signalled by peripheral ghrelin is unknown.</p><p id="P7">Together, vS is well placed to control anticipatory feeding-related behaviour. It is consistently implicated in hunger-based decisions, its dysfunction impairs behaviour requiring hunger sensing, and it has ghrelin-sensitive neurons that project to two brain regions both crucially important for defining feeding behaviour. Therefore, in this study we used a combination of quantitative behaviour, <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and manipulation, and slice physiology to address the role of vS circuitry in hunger-based decisions. We found that activity of a unique subpopulation of vS neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (vS-NAc) increased when animals approached and investigated food, and this activity inhibited the transition to begin eating. Increases in peripheral ghrelin reduced vS-NAc activity during this anticipatory phase of feeding behaviour by increasing the postsynaptic influence of inhibition. Furthermore, removal of the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) specifically from vS-NAc neurons impaired ghrelin-induced changes in feeding-related behaviour. Together, these experiments define a ghrelin-sensitive hippocampal circuit that informs the decision to eat based on internal state.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Peripheral ghrelin administration increases the transition from food investigation to food consumption</title><p id="P8">Feeding behaviour can be described as the chaining together of distinct, stereotyped behaviours such as exploratory sniffing and investigation of food (presented here as ‘Inv’) food consumption (‘Eat’), as well as non-feeding behaviours such as ‘Rear’, ‘Groom’ and ‘Rest’ (‘Oth’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Halford et al., 1998</xref>). Increases in peripheral ghrelin are known to dramatically alter behaviour towards food, in particular, through the promotion of the initiation of eating. However, despite intensive investigation, it is unclear how increases in peripheral ghrelin alter the structure of this moment-to-moment behaviour around food.</p><p id="P9">To address this, we first confirmed that ghrelin injections caused an increase in food consumption in sated mice when they were repeatedly presented with a familiar food item (a chow pellet) in a well habituated arena, when compared to injection of PBS vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, by scoring each behaviour performed by the mouse during the session, we found that this increased consumption resulted from a large and specific increase in the frequency of initiating eating, with only minimal change in the frequency of food investigation or the frequency of non-feeding behaviours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we asked how sequences of behaviour changed within each session to result in this increase in eating. To quantitatively describe the organisation of such sequences, we analysed scored behaviour (‘Inv’, ‘Eat’ and ‘Oth’) as a discrete-time Markov chain - a vector of behavioural states that change as a function of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>). We then computed the transition matrix Pij for each animal (which defines the animal’s probability of transitioning from behaviour i to behaviour j during the session), and compared these matrices across different states of hunger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Using this analysis, we found that the effect of ghrelin was very specific, and was centred around transitions from food investigation (‘Inv’). While PBS-treated mice frequently investigated the food pellet, this investigation was very rarely followed by a transition to eating. In contrast, in ghrelin treated mice, the frequency of investigation of the food pellet was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1</xref>), but the transition from investigation to eating was substantially increased. Overall, this suggests that the effect of ghrelin was to increase the probability of transitioning from investigation of, to consumption of food (p<sub>(Inv-&gt;eat)</sub>), with only minimal effect on other behavioural transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 2</xref>). This specific alteration in behaviour can account for previous work suggesting a key role of ghrelin signalling in the anticipation and initiation of feeding.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>vS-NAc activity tracks investigation and eating behaviour</title><p id="P12">Despite much investigation, the precise neural mechanisms underlying the effect of ghrelin on anticipatory feeding behaviour remain unclear. This problem is often characterised as one of conditional ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gershman, 2017</xref>) – where the appropriate behaviour towards the same food-associated cue is different dependent on internal state. One area that is thought to play a key role in this ability is the ventral hippocampus, via its strong excitatory projections from the CA1/subiculum border (vS) to downstream areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>), and the lateral hypothalamus (LH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>) that arise from distinct, minimally overlapping population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; Naber and Witter, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated i) how activity in vS was modulated during feeding behaviour, and ii) how this activity was distributed across the two populations of projection neurons.</p><p id="P13">We first confirmed that the two projections from vS were composed of largely non overlapping populations using retrograde cholera toxin labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we used intersectional viral expression of cre-dependent GCaMP6f in vS, paired with an injection of AAVretro- cre in either NAc or LH, and combined this with implantation of an optical fibre immediately above vS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). This allowed us to record bulk calcium activity of each projection pathway as mice were freely behaving in response to presentation of chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">For each mouse, we first aligned this calcium activity to the onset of each class of behaviour (either ‘Inv’, ‘Eat’ or ‘Oth’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We noticed that there was a large and consistent increase in the activity of vS-NAc neurons leading up to and during the investigation of food, reminiscent of previous descriptions of these neurons ramping towards salient locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In addition, there was a consistent drop of vS-NAc activity upon the initiation of eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). Together this suggests that vS-NAc neurons are active during anticipation and investigation of food, but are then rapidly inhibited upon the commencement of feeding. In contrast, despite multiple suggestions of a crucial role for vS-LH neurons in learning about food dependent, and other affective cues, in this simple assay vS-LH neurons did not show any consistent activity that was time locked to exploratory or feeding behaviour in this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Instead vS-LH neurons showed robust activity in response to salient stimuli such as the presentation of an object or chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">González et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 3</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Together, this suggests that the activity of vS-NAc neurons is bidirectionally modulated during investigation and consumption of familiar food. Moreover, increases in vS-NAc activity around the investigation of food is consistent with theoretical descriptions of a role in the anticipation of feeding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>vS-NAc activity during food investigation is inhibited by ghrelin</title><p id="P17">Our previous results revealed that there was a large anticipatory ramp of activity in vS-NAc neurons during investigation of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). As the effect of ghrelin was to alter the consequences of such investigative behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), we next wanted to investigate how this activity in vS was modulated by increases in peripheral ghrelin.</p><p id="P18">We repeated our investigation of vS activity in mice with counterbalanced injections of either ghrelin or PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As before, ghrelin injections markedly increased both total consumption of chow, but also specifically the transition from investigation to eating in both cohorts of mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 4</xref>). Importantly however, this change in behaviour was accompanied by a substantial reduction of the activity of vS-NAc neurons during food investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>). This effect was specific to activity around investigation, as alterations in vS-NAc activity upon eating were maintained across both ghrelin- and PBS-treated animals. We reasoned that the behavioural effect of ghrelin – increased chow consumption due to an increased transition from investigation to eating – may be defined by the magnitude of inhibition of vS-NAc neurons. Consistent with this idea, on a session-by-session basis there was a negative correlation between the activity of vS-NAc neurons during food investigation and the total amount of food consumed in that session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, again there was no effect of ghrelin on vS-LH neurons, and activity remained invariant across each behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-J</xref>), suggesting a projection specific modulation of vS neurons upon increases of peripheral ghrelin.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Artificially increasing vS-NAc activity blocks ghrelin mediated increases in feeding</title><p id="P19">Our results so far suggest a model where a high level of eating after increases in peripheral ghrelin is associated with inhibition of vS-NAc activity during food investigation. This is reminiscent of a much-hypothesised role for vS-NAc neurons in behavioural inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gray and McNaughton, 2003</xref>) – where increased activity of vS-NAc neurons inhibits ongoing behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We reasoned that if activity of vS-NAc neurons specifically inhibited the transition from investigation to eating, artificial activation of vS-NAc neurons should block ghrelin-induced increases in feeding, but have little effect on other behaviours, in particular the frequency of investigation of food. To test this, we used injections of AAV to express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) bilaterally in excitatory neurons in vS, and bilaterally implanted optical fibres in NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This allowed us to activate vS terminals in NAc with brief pulses of blue light. We then compared mice expressing ChR2 with control mice expressing GFP. We repeated the ten-minute feeding assay in a counterbalanced design where in both cases the mouse was given ghrelin administration, but on one day the mouse underwent 20 Hz blue light stimulation during the session, while on the alternate day no light was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In control animals, there was no effect of blue light stimulation, and ghrelin resulted in robust feeding behaviour in both light ON and light OFF days (as seen by high chow consumption, high frequency of investigation of food, and high frequency of eating, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, by creating transition matrices for each animal in each condition, we found that there was a high probability of transitioning from investigation to eating p<sub>(Inv-&gt;eat)</sub>, and this was unaltered by light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, light delivery in ChR2-expressing animals caused large but specific changes in behaviour. While light stimulation had no influence on the frequency of food investigation, it resulted in an almost complete cessation of eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Again, by constructing transition matrices for these animals we found that this was due to a marked reduction in p<sub>(Inv-&gt;eat)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that activation of vS-NAc neurons blocks the transition from food investigation to eating, even in the presence of high levels of peripheral ghrelin. This suggests that a key effect of peripheral ghrelin in vS may be to inhibit the activity of vS-NAc neurons, to overcome a ‘block’ this activity imposes on feeding behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Increasing peripheral ghrelin increases inhibitory postsynaptic amplitude in vS-NAc neurons</title><p id="P22">Our results so far suggest that ghrelin may influence hippocampal circuitry by inhibiting the activity of vS-NAc neurons during food investigation. We next wanted to look for the cellular underpinnings of this change. We hypothesised that this decrease in activity may be due to plasticity of inhibitory connectivity. To test this, we injected mice with two colours of retrobeads – one in NAc and one in LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sánchez-Bellot et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>).

Interestingly we found that while ghrelin administration had no influence on E:I ratio in vS-LH neurons, in vS-NAc neurons there was a large decrease in E:I ratio in mice treated with ghrelin compared to controls, suggesting an increase in relative inhibitory synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Next, we recorded miniature inhibitory post synaptic currents (mIPSCs) from both vS-NAc and vS-LH neurons in control and ghrelin treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). In these recordings the amplitude of mIPSCs is proportional to the postsynaptic efficacy, while the frequency of events is proportional to both the probability of release and the number of synaptic connections. Consistent with our results above, we found that ghrelin resulted in a large increase in inhibition in vS-NAc neurons, but no changes in vS-LH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). This increased inhibition was due to an increase in the amplitude of mIPSCs in vS-NAc neurons, with no change in their frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Together, this suggests that increased peripheral ghrelin increases synaptic inhibition onto vS-NAc neurons, through an increase in the postsynaptic strength of inhibitory synapses.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>GHSR1a expression in vS-NAc neurons is required for ghrelin mediated changes in inhibitory synaptic strength</title><p id="P25">We next wanted to understand the mechanism by which peripheral ghrelin can influence synaptic inhibition in vS-NAc neurons. vS neurons express the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a, and peripheral ghrelin is known to cross the blood-brain-barrier and enter the hippocampus, where it has the ability to directly influence postsynaptic properties to influence behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to ask if the influence of peripheral ghrelin we observed on vS inhibitory synaptic properties might be via this direct activation of the GHSR1a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane of vS-NAc neurons.</p><p id="P26">To test this, we developed an AAV containing a cre-dependent RNA interference (RNAi) cassette that robustly knocked down expression of GHSR1a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 5</xref>). We then used an intersectional viral method as before to reduce levels of GHSR1a only in vS-NAc neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 5</xref>), and used an RNAi targeted to a scrambled sequence not present in the genome as a control. Thus in these animals, GHSR1a is knocked down only in vS neurons that project to NAc, allowing us to investigate the influence of GHSR1a in these neurons, while leaving GHSR1a expression in other canonical regions such as the arcuate nucleus and LH intact. After allowing 2 weeks for expression, we then prepared acute slices from these animals 20 minutes after i.p. injection with either PBS or ghrelin as before. We then recorded mIPSCs from identified vS-NAc neurons expressing the GHSR1a or control RNAi constructs.</p><p id="P27">Consistent with our previous results, we found that in mice expressing the scrambled control RNAi in vS-NAc neurons, ghrelin administration resulted in an increase in mIPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). However, in neurons with knockdown of GHSR1a, mIPSCs were almost completely insensitive to ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Therefore the changes in inhibitory synaptic connectivity in vS-NAc neurons on administration of peripheral ghrelin require expression of the GHSR1a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane of vS-NAc neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>vS-NAc GHSR1a expression is required for peripheral ghrelin induced alterations in vS-NAc activity during feeding</title><p id="P28">Our results above suggested that increased synaptic inhibition in vS-NAc neurons after ghrelin treatment is mediated via postsynaptic GHSR1a. Our model proposes that the reduction of vS-NAc activity during investigation of food induced by ghrelin is due to this increased inhibitory drive. If this were true, then GHSR1a knockdown should also block this ghrelin mediated reduction in activity. To test this, we again used intersectional viral infection to unilaterally express either control or GHSR1a RNAi constructs in vS-NAc neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In each mouse we also expressed GCaMP6f in vS-NAc neurons, and implanted an optical fibre just above vS. Importantly, due to redundancy across hemispheres, unilateral expression of the RNAi constructs ensured that behaviour was not affected by the manipulation of GHSR1a levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 5</xref>), and so allowed investigation of alterations in vS-NAc activity under equivalent behavioural conditions. Together, this approach allowed us to use fibre photometry to monitor the activity of vS-NAc neurons with or without GHSR1a knockdown during feeding behaviour, and to investigate the influence of peripheral ghrelin administration on this activity.</p><p id="P29">We first found that mice expressing the control RNAi again showed a ramp of activity around investigation in sated mice, and that this was reduced after ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). In contrast, the activity of vS-NAc neurons in GHSR1a knockdown animals during food investigation remained high even after ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). Together this suggests that GHSR1a in vS-NAc neurons is required for peripheral ghrelin to increase inhibitory synaptic strength in vS-NAc neurons, and that removal of GHSR1a renders vS-NAc activity during investigation of food insensitive to peripheral ghrelin.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>vS-NAc GHSR1a expression is required for peripheral ghrelin-mediated increase in the transition from investigation to eating</title><p id="P30">Our results suggest that GHSR1a is required for peripheral ghrelin to inhibit the activity of vS-NAc neurons around food investigation. Moreover, our optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) show that this reduction in vS-NAc activity is necessary for ghrelin-mediated increases in transitioning from food investigation to food consumption. Therefore, we hypothesised that GHSR1a in vS-NAc neurons would be a key factor in ghrelin-mediated changes in feeding behaviour.</p><p id="P31">To test this, we intersectionally expressed GHSR1a RNAi bilaterally in vS-NAc neurons, and compared to littermate controls with control RNAi expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We then used this approach to investigate the influence of GHSR1a knockdown on feeding in response to peripheral ghrelin.</p><p id="P32">We first looked at the effect of GHSR1a knockdown on the frequency of feeding associated behaviours. We found no effect of GHSR1a knockdown on either investigation of food, or feeding in PBS treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). This suggests that there is little role for constitutive GHSR1a activity in sated mice, potentially due to a strong floor effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kern et al., 2015</xref>). After ghrelin treatment, control animals maintained similar levels of food investigation, but this was accompanied by a large increase in the frequency of eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, while GHSR1a RNAi animals showed a similar level of investigation of food, this was accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of eating compared to control animals – similar to the effect of artificially activating vS-NAc neurons with ChR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Next, we constructed transition matrices for each animal in each condition, and again saw a consistent and specific reduction of the probability to transition from investigation to eating p<sub>(Inv-&gt;eat)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Overall, we have shown that peripheral ghrelin increases inhibitory synaptic strength onto vS-NAc neurons via a mechanism that requires GHSR1a. This increased inhibition accompanies reduced vS-NAc activity during investigation of food, which promotes the transition from investigation to eating. This mechanism is consistent with a classically described role for the ventral hippocampus in behavioural inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gray and McNaughton, 2003</xref>), and provides a cellular basis of hippocampal resolution of the conditional ambiguity of food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gershman, 2017</xref>). Moreover, this provides the circuit basis for the direct interaction of cognitive and goal directed brain regions in the control of feeding, and provides a mechanistic locus for the close interaction between diet, health and cognitive ability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">In this study, we have shown a key circuit mechanism for how peripheral ghrelin dramatically alters feeding behaviour. We observed large increases in vS-NAc activity during investigation of food, and this activity inhibited the transition from food investigation to consumption. Consistent with a key role, we found that increases in peripheral ghrelin act via modulation of this activity through postsynaptic GHSR1a signalling. Via this interaction, peripheral ghrelin increases the amplitude of postsynaptic inhibition, reducing vS-NAc activity during food investigation, and thus facilitating an increase in the transition to eating. The identification of a ghrelin-sensitive vS circuit that mediates food-seeking behaviour provides one of the first mechanistic descriptions of how the hippocampus may sense an internal state like hunger <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec id="S12"><title>The role of ghrelin in anticipatory versus consummatory behaviour</title><p id="P35">Our data demonstrate that ghrelin inhibits vS activity specifically during food anticipation, and suggest that it is this inhibition that promotes the transition to eating. On the surface, this goes against classic notions of ghrelin as a ’hunger hormone’ that mimics fasting by increasing food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Tschöp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Wren et al., 2001</xref>). However, this is consistent with several observations suggesting ghrelin mediates food anticipation rather than food consumption. For example, the concentration of circulating ghrelin accurately reflects the anticipation of an upcoming meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cummings et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Drazen et al., 2006</xref>), and studies employing pharmacological and genetic disruption of GHSR1a, both systemically and in vS, show that mice have disrupted anticipatory behaviour preceding a meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Verhagen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, GHSR1a-null mice have normal body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sun et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that ghrelin is dispensable in homeostatic food intake regulation. Importantly, we did observe increases in the duration of each eating bout in ghrelin treated animals, consistent with classic descriptions of ghrelin function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1</xref>). However, only the frequency of meal initiation was altered by vS-NAc GHSR1a manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), with meal duration unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 6</xref>). This dissociation of function suggests that multiple roles of ghrelin may be separated across distinct regions and circuits – while the role of ghrelin in vS seems to be specifically in anticipation of feeding, different effects of ghrelin may be mediated by other brain regions such as hindbrain or hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rossi and Stuber, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Mechanisms of ghrelin signalling in vS</title><p id="P36">Given the tight regulation of substance entry across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), one important question is whether ghrelin and other hormones mediate their effects on vS circuitry by directly binding hippocampal neurons, or are instead signalled indirectly via upstream synaptic inputs that themselves have access to peripheral ghrelin. The hippocampus is situated adjacent to circulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, and has a rich surrounding blood supply from the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lathe, 2001</xref>) that facilitates transfer of molecules across the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hamasaki et al., 2020</xref>), including ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Banks et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with a vast array of peripheral ghrelin mediated structural and functional effects on hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>), but also the role of hippocampal ghrelin in influencing behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>). More generally, the hippocampus expresses functional receptors for a multitude of peptide hormones similar to ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lathe, 2001</xref>), such as leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Irving and Harvey, 2014</xref>) and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Soto et al., 2019</xref>). Together this suggests that these hormones are likely capable of binding to hippocampal neurons to affect their function.</p><p id="P37">It is important to note however that the influence of ghrelin of vS circuitry may occur via other, indirect mechanisms. First there is a line of evidence that proposes that peptide hormones like ghrelin, insulin and leptin are unable to cross the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Furness et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kern et al., 2015</xref>) without specialised mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Banks et al., 2002</xref>), and it is unclear if these are present in vS. While the contradictory findings surrounding ghrelin access to vS could be explained by BBB permeability being extremely plastic (for example, accessibility of ghrelin is itself often dependent on hunger state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Banks et al., 2008</xref>; Langlet et al., 2013)) there remains a possibility that direct permeability through the BBB might not be the major route for ghrelin to influence vS.</p><p id="P38">As a result, multiple alternate mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of GHSR1a signalling in vS. First, it has been proposed that the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a exerts its effect through ligand independent constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Petersen et al., 2009</xref>). However, this is hard to reconcile with past experiments showing the presence of peripheral ghrelin in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diano et al., 2006</xref>), as well as other experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>) including ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) showing an active role of the receptor in response to stimuli, suggesting a role beyond constitutive activity. There may therefore, be a combination of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity within the GHSR1a system in vS. A key point of future work will be to understand the distinct roles of these two potential mechanisms.</p><p id="P39">A second alternative to direct ghrelin sensing in vS, is through dimerization of the GHSR1a receptor with the D1 dopamine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kern et al., 2015</xref>), which could render vS dopamine signalling dependent upon GHSR1a expression. In this scenario, ghrelin could indirectly activate ghrelin-sensing LH neurons that then promote VTA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cone et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2016</xref>). This activity may then provide a dopaminergic input to hippocampus that through dimerisation may be sensitive to the presence GHSR1a. This also has the potential to be the case for other neuromodulators or neuropeptides that could also act as co-agonists to ghrelin signalling in vS, including acetyl-choline from septal areas, serotonin from raphe or melanin concentrating hormone from hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Colgin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Noble et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Together, while our study shows that vS-NAc circuitry is sensitive to the level of peripheral ghrelin, and this sensitivity is dependent on postsynaptic expression of the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a, future work is needed to explore whether ghrelin directly modulates hippocampal activity via BBB permeability or indirectly through modulation of upstream synaptic inputs.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The role of vS in hunger-sensitive goal directed behaviour</title><p id="P41">It is becoming increasingly understood that the hippocampus not only encodes the relationships between distinct cues in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rudy and Sutherland, 1995</xref>), but also the value of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Knudsen and Wallis, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and their interaction. For example, the hippocampal-to-NAc projection has been proposed to be important for the learning of value associations in both physical and abstract dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>), and to relay these signals to ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">AlSubaie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pennartz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>). This ability is proposed to allow the utilisation of past experience to anticipate the outcome of upcoming behaviour. Consistent with this proposed role, we found that vS-NAc was specifically active around food investigation, and that this activity ramps up during investigative behaviour, consistent with studies of spatial goal directed navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>). This activity was anticorrelated with the value of the anticipated outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lafferty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>) and the overall amount of food consumed during the session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) – when sated, vS-NAc activity was high, and this correlated with a low probability of initiating eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, when peripheral ghrelin was high, vS-NAc activity was low. Interestingly, this reduction in anticipatory vS-NAc activity during investigation was distinct from a separate decrease in activity upon food consumption that was insensitive to ghrelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with vS ghrelin sensing only influencing the initiation of eating, but not the increase in eating duration that also results from increases in peripheral ghrelin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 6</xref>). Therefore, while vS-NAc activity is responsive to the initiation of eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>), and manipulation of vS activity can directly influence consummatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), ghrelin signalling in vS influences only the anticipatory activity leading up to food consumption.</p><p id="P42">Downstream of vS, our work aligns well with a proposed circuit mechanism for the rapid control of feeding behaviour promoted by activity of D1 dopamine receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) in NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lafferty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). vS input to NAc preferentially targets D1 MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2014</xref>), activity of which can rapidly supress reward consumption, and promote exploratory and seeking behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reed et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, during consummatory behaviour, a subpopulation of D1 MSNs that project to LH directly inhibit eating via targeting of LH GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, through this specialised connectivity, vS-NAc ghrelin sensitivity is ideally situated to provide strong and acute control over feeding behaviour, and provides a means for this control to be utilised to shape behaviour based on internal state.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Internal state as a distinct dimension of the hippocampal representation</title><p id="P43">The hippocampus has long been viewed as circuit by which otherwise ambiguous cues can be separated through their association with other cues that occur in close spatial and temporal proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Per Andersen et al., 2006</xref>).

Following infusion of the virus, the pipette was left in place for an additional 10 mins before being slowly retracted. For anatomy experiments, following injection of substances into the brain, animals were sutured and recovered for 30 mins on a heat pad.

The skull was roughened and two metal screws were inserted into the skull to aid cement attachment. Photometry cannulas were targeted to ventral CA1/subiculum, optogenetic cannulas were inserted at a 10-degree angle targeted to NAc shell. Cannulas were secured to the skull by applying two layers of adhesive dental cement (Superbond CB). The skin was attached to the cured dental cement with Vetbond. Animals received a subcutaneous injection of carprofen (∼5 μL of 0.5 mg/mL stock) prior to recovery in a warm chamber for 1 hour and continued receiving carprofen in their drinking water (0.05 mg/mL) for 48 hours post-surgery.

During the last 3 days of habituation, empty plastic weighing boats were provided in the home cage to habituate the animals to these objects. During this time animals were also habituated to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, patch cord attachment (for photometry and optogenetic experiments) and the behavioural boxes as described below. All behavioural experiments were carried out in MEDPC sound-attenuating chambers containing behavioural boxes (21.59 × 18.08 × 12.7 cm) with blank walls. Video recordings were conducted with infrared cameras positioned above each chamber, and video was acquired at 15 or 25 Hz using Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lopes and Monteiro, 2021</xref>). The different frame rates were due to a change of PS4 cameras over the course of experiments, and this difference in frame rates did not affect the resolution of capturing naturalistic behaviour given the relatively slower time course of evolving behaviours during feeding. All experiments were performed consistently during the middle-to-end of the light cycle (from 2 pm to 7 pm) to control for circadian rhythm variables.</p><p id="P51">For all behavioural experiments, after acclimatisation to handling and the behavioural chambers, mice were habituated over the course of 2 to 3 days with three i.p. injections of 100 μl sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to habituate them to manual scruffing and i.p. injection. Following this, animals for photometry and optogenetics experiments were habituated to patch cord attachment for a 10-minute period, as described above. At the end of this habituation period, animals were given an i.p. injection of either ghrelin (2 mg/kg; Tocris) or vehicle control (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS; pH = 7.2). The order of the injections was counterbalanced across animals. The volume of the i.p. injection was fixed at 100 μl. Animals were allowed 15 mins to recover post-injection before the presentation of non-food and food objects. The day of ghrelin injection was selected randomly for each animal, and PBS and ghrelin injection days were spaced apart for a duration of at least 24 hours. After termination of each testing session, the amount of chow consumed during the 10 min presentation was weighed; any spillage of food was recovered and subsequently weighed.</p><p id="P52">For photometry experiments, the time of food or non-food presentation was noted down and used to manually synchronise the photometry recordings to the start of stimulus presentation.

Light delivery was given in a counterbalanced design, separated by at least 48 hours. On stimulation day, light was delivered at 20 Hz (5 ms on, 45 ms off) throughout the duration of the experiment. One mouse was excluded due to mild seizure activity upon light stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Annotation of feeding behaviour</title><p id="P54">Feeding behaviour was analysed as a composite sequence of five simple, distinct and reproducible behaviours. These elemental behaviours were: Investigate (sniffing or tactile interaction with the object or food without eating), Eat (biting food or chewing movements close to food), Rear (standing on hindlegs while elevating head, can be supported on the walls i.e. thigmotaxis), Groom (licking/scratching of fur, limbs or tail, usually high-frequency movement) and Rest (motionless, usually in corner of box). These behaviours together are referred to as the Behavioural Satiety Sequence (BSS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Halford et al., 1998</xref>). These features were manually scored offline using Ethovision XT13 (Noldus). Where possible, manual scoring was conducted in a blinded fashion to experimental groups. For a subset of videos, two independent scorers conducted manual annotation of the behaviour videos to ensure reproducibility. Manual annotation of BSS behaviours from 10- minute videos spanning the food or non-food object presentation period were conducted at 15 or 25 Hz on a frame-by-frame basis. This manual annotation produced vectors of 0s and 1s, where 0 indicates the absence and 1 the presence of the BSS behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Analysis of feeding behaviour as a stochastic Markov process</title><p id="P55">Each behavioural dataset exists as a sequence of BSS behaviours. In other words, the behaviour for a given animal is described by a vector of BSS behaviours occurring over time. Although the total time spent engaging in one behaviour can be computed from this vector, additional information regarding an animal’s feeding strategy exists in the sequence of expression of each BSS behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>). To analyse this sequential information in more detail, we analysed the annotated behavioural patterns for each mouse as a stochastic Markov process that defined the animal’s feeding strategy when presented with chow across different states of hunger. Specifically, a Markov chain is a vector of states that change as a function of time. In this case, the Markov chain is comprised of 5 states corresponding to the 5 BSS behaviours. These Markov chains are described fully by a transition matrix P, where the P<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> term represents the transition probability from BSS behaviour <italic>i</italic> to <italic>j</italic>. As there are 5 BSS behaviours, P is a 5 × 5 transition matrix, where the rows represent the current BSS behaviour, the columns represent the BSS behaviour one-step ahead and the values in each row sums to 1. For display purposes, as non feeding behaviours showed little consistent, but independent alterations upon ghrelin injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1</xref>), we constructed simpler, 3 × 3 transition matrices by combining non-feeding behaviours into a single state. For comparison, 5 × 5 matrix analysis is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 2</xref>. To compute the empirical transition matrices for each animal, the frequency of each possible transition from behaviour <italic>i</italic> was calculated and normalised by the total number of behavioural transitions occurring from behaviour i. These transitions are assumed to be Markovian, which simplifies the calculation of the transition probability P(state = j | state = i). Specifically, the probability of transitioning from state <italic>i</italic> to state j is dependent only on the current state <italic>i</italic> and not on states preceding state i. For each animal, there were two transition matrices, PPBS and PGhrelin. Importantly, these Markov chain vectors disregarded information relating to duration, i.e. the time spent in engaging in one behaviour and the inter-event duration. In other words, by focusing on transitions between BSS behaviours, this analysis was conducted time-agnostically; this method has been shown to accurately capture moment-to-moment behavioural strategies under differing contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>) by focusing on the transition probability from one behavioural bout to the next. For example, the vector [Investigate, Investigate, Eat, Groom] represents four distinct BSS bouts of variable length within and between bouts, but only the transitions between bouts were analysed. Note behavioural data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> contains mice also utilised for photometry experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Analysis of Ca2+ signals from fibre photometry</title><p id="P56">Measurement of calcium fluorescence signals was carried out as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sánchez-Bellot et al., 2022</xref>). 470 nm and 405 nm LEDs were used as excitation sources, and the light amplitudes were modulated sinusoidally at 500 Hz and 210 Hz carrier frequencies, respectively. The excitation light was passed through excitation filters (for 470 nm and for 405 nm wavelengths), and a dichroic mirror to combine the two LEDs into a single beam. A 49/51 beam-splitter was used to split the beam into two independent excitation beams for simultaneous recording of two animals. The excitation light was coupled through a fibre collimation package into a fibre patch cord, and linked to a large core (200 μm), high NA (0.39) implant cannula (Thorlabs). Emitted fluorescence signals were collected through the same fibre. Fluorescence output signal was filtered through a GFP emission filter (transmission above 505 nm) and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver. The photoreceiver was sampled at 10 kHz, and each of the two LED signals was independently recovered using quadrature demodulation on a custom-written Labview software: this process involved using an LED channel as a signal reference, taking a 90-degree phase-shifted copy of this reference signal and multiplying these signals in quadrature. The multiplied signal was then low-pass filtered with a Butterworth filter (order = 3, cut-off frequency = 15 Hz). The hypotenuse was then computed using the square root of the sum of squares of the two channels. The result corresponds to the demodulated signal amplitude and was decimated to 500 Hz before storing to disk.</p><p id="P57">To correct for artefacts resulting from Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent processes such as movement, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent 405 nm isosbestic wavelength signal was scaled to the 470 nm wavelength. The coefficients for the scaling were computed through a least-squares linear regression between the 405 nm and 470 nm signal. This estimated motion (scaled 405 nm) signal was then subtracted from the 470 nm signal to obtain a pure Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal.</p><p id="P58">Calcium activity signals time-locked to the presentation of chow were extracted using the time of presentation manually determined from video recordings. The signal was decimated to 15 Hz, z-score normalised, filtered with a Gaussian filter (σ = 1.5) and baselined to the mean signal in the -50 to -10 seconds preceding the time of presentation of food or non-food object. For event-triggered analysis, the photometry signal was aligned to the onset of each behavioural event obtained from the manually scored behaviour. The behavioural events were clustered into bouts (defined as continuous engagement in the behaviour), and the onset of each bout was taken as the time point to align the photometry signal. A perievent window of 20 s surrounding the onset of the behaviour was obtained for each signal, and the resulting signal was baselined to the time period from -10 to -7.5 seconds relative to the onset of each event. All trials obtained for an animal were averaged to obtain a nested average event-triggered signal; these signals were then averaged across mice to obtain the population event-triggered average. Due to the stochastic nature of emitting a given behaviour, not all behaviours were present in all animals. To avoid including the same behavioural events across multiple event triggered averages, only events separated by more than 5s were included. Animals displayed Investigative behaviour consistently in all internal states of hunger, but the proportion of animals showing Eat, Groom, Rest and Rear behaviours were variable.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Linear encoding model relating behaviour to neural activity</title><p id="P59">To quantify the contribution of each BSS behaviour to neural activity, a multiple regression model was used. The linear model was constructed using the Python package sklearn, with the z-scored baselined photometry signal as the dependent variable, and a regressor matrix of BSS behavioural arrays as independent variables. The regressor matrix contained 27 regressors in total: 5 behavioural regressors (Investigate, Eat, Rear, Groom and Rest), 20 behavioural transition regressors (for example, Investigate → Eat), a manual presentation regressor and a velocity regressor. The 5 behavioural regressors were coded as pulses of 0s and 1s, where 1s indicate the engagement in a BSS behaviour and 0s the absence of engagement. The 20 transition regressors were included to account for any possible contribution of behavioural transitions to the photometry signal, and were derived as follows: a Markov chain vector of BSS behaviours was produced at 15 or 25 Hz and any across-BSS transitions (e.g. Investigate → Eat, not Investigate → Investigate) occurring within 5 seconds was emitted as a temporal pulse of 1 at the onset of the next BSS behaviour. To account for temporal distortion of the behavioural transition period in the associated Ca2+ activity, an exponential function was first computed: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mtext>                </mml:mtext><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula> where t1/2 is the half-life of the exponential function and set to 2 seconds.

This produces a sharp peak to 1 and a decay rate of t1/2. The exponential decay function was set to have a half-life of 2 s to approximate near-complete decay of the GCaMP6f signal. The presentation regressor was set to an exponential function with a peak time at presentation onset and a decay rate of 5 seconds to capture the salience of stimulus presentation. Finally, the velocity regressor was a continuous variable tracking the instantaneous velocity of the animal derived from position tracking using Ethovision. To handle periods of discontinuous tracking, the velocity data were pre-processed with a ceiling of 5 cm/s (to handle large jumps in tracking), smoothed with a rolling mean filter (window = 3 seconds), and imputed via linear interpolated to handle missing values.</p><p id="P60">The final linear encoding model was therefore the following: <disp-formula id="FD4"><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mi>Σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where Y is the dFz in one animal, β0 is the intercept (bias), ε is a Gaussian noise term, NB and NTr are the numbers of the behavioural and transition regressors (5 and 20, respectively), βB, βTr, βP and βV are the beta weights for the behavioural, transition, presentation and velocity regressors, respectively. Specifically, the beta weights βB can be interpreted as the isolated, average neural response to engagement in that BSS behaviour. The crucial aspect of the linear encoding model is the simultaneous inclusion of possible confounding variables, for example, behavioural transitions and velocity, which may each contaminate the neural response. The linear model thus statistically disambiguates the neural response to BSS behaviour engagement from other events in close temporal proximity.</p><p id="P61">The linear model was fit using ridge regression, a version of the ordinary leasts quares regression that penalises the size of the estimated β coefficients by L2 regularisation. This ensures that the β weights were constrained to avoid overfitting, and the penalty term α adjusts the degree of shrinkage of the β weights. Prior to fitting, the dataset was split into an 80% training set to estimate the β weights and 20% test set for evaluating the model predictions. On this training dataset, a nested cross-validation procedure was used: first, the training dataset was split into 5 folds for evaluation. For each fold, the α hyperparameter was tuned using leave-one-out cross-validation (GCV). GCV works analogously to a grid search by exploring the alpha parameter space, and selecting the α value that maximises the prediction accuracy of the model; the values of α tested were 10−3, 10−2, 10−1, 100 and 101, using the function RidgeCV on Python’s sklearn package. The values of α did not differ significantly between the PBS and Ghrelin conditions. The predictor matrix was normalised by subtracting the predictor matrix by its mean and dividing by the L2 norm of the matrix, using the function RidgeCV. The β weights were computed analytically using the following formula: <disp-formula id="FD5"><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>X</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mtext>X</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mtext>I</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>X</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mtext>Y</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where X is the predictor matrix, α is the ridge penalty term, I is the identity matrix and Y is the observed dFz.

The alpha level was defined as 0.05. No power analysis was run to determine sample size a priori. The sample sizes chosen are similar to those used in previous publications. Throughout the figures and text, the * symbol represents p &lt; 0.05, unless otherwise stated, and n.s. stands for not significant. Animals were randomly assigned to a virus cohort (e.g. ChR2 versus GFP), and where possible the experimenter was blinded to each mouse’s virus assignment when the experiment was performed. This was sometimes not possible due to e.g. the presence of the injection site in the recorded slice.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Statstics
