worldwide and continues to spread in countries where vaccines are not yet widely available, or its citizens are hesitant to become vaccinated. Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed essential for viral replication. We examined the master UPR sensor IRE1α kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1α-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1α as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1α through autophosphorylation, but its RNase activity fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, while IRE1α was dispensable for replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested, it was required for maximal expression of genes associated with several key cellular functions, including the interferon signaling pathway, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1α, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in late 2019. It was the third lethal zoonotic coronavirus to emerge into humans after SARS-CoV (2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012), each of which has been associated with acute lung injury and hypoxemic respiratory failure. While coronaviruses are divided into four genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), all three of the lethal human coronaviruses are betacoronaviruses, albeit from different lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are sarbecoviruses, while MERS-CoV is a merbecovirus. Other human CoVs, including HCoV-OC43 (OC43) and HCoV-HKU1 (HKU-1), are embecoviruses as is the model murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). All CoVs have similar genome structures, replication cycles, and the human CoVs as well as some MHV strains exhibit tropism for the epithelia of the respiratory tract, the portal of entry. They replicate their RNAs and produce subgenomic mRNAs by conserved mechanisms and encode homologous structural as well as replicase proteins. Despite the similarities among all coronaviruses, each lineage expresses distinct accessory proteins that may confer differences in host-virus interactions. Indeed, we have previously found that SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and MHV all induce somewhat different levels of activation and/or antagonism of interferon (IFN) signaling and other dsRNA induced antiviral innate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">One key pathway involved in the virus-induced host response is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response that regulates protein homeostasis (referred to as proteostasis) in this organelle. One third of all eukaryotic proteins, including most that are inserted into membranes or secreted, are synthesized through co-translational translocation into the ER lumen. Likewise, viral membrane associated proteins are translated and processed in association with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Once in the ER, these polypeptides undergo stringent quality control monitoring to ensure that they are properly processed and folded. If the capacity to fold proteins is unable to keep up with demand, misfolded proteins will accumulate in the ER lumen—a condition referred to as “ER stress.” The presence of misfolded proteins in the ER is sensed by three transmembrane sentinel proteins - activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)1α - which trigger an intracellular signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). In an effort to restore proteostasis, activation of these sensors induces transcription factors that turn on genes encoding chaperones, oxidoreductases, and ER-associated decay (ERAD) components(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The UPR also inhibits cap-dependent translation, thus decreasing the load on the ER and giving it extra time to fold proteins already in production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). If successful, these adaptive UPR programs restore ER homeostasis.</p><p id="P4">The most ancient UPR pathway is controlled by IRE1α — an ER transmembrane bifunctional kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) that employs auto-phosphorylation to control its catalytic RNase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In response to ER stress, IRE1α undergoes auto-phosphorylation and dimerization to allosterically activate its RNase domain to excise a 26nt non-conventional intron in <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA; re-ligation of spliced <italic>XBP1</italic> shifts the open reading frame, and its translation produces the homeostatic transcription factor XBP1s (s=spliced) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Once synthesized, XBP1s upregulates genes that expand the ER and its protein folding machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). IRE1α can additionally lead to apoptosis and inflammation via JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Prolonged ER stress can induce regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), promoting the cleavage of additional targets beyond XBP1 mRNA, such as secretory protein and ER-localized mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In the short term, RIDD may promote adaptation through further reducing translation and protein burden on the ER. However, prolonged RIDD leads to the depletion of vital ER resident enzymes and structural components to exacerbate ER stress and hasten cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P5">There is a large body of evidence that viral replication of mammalian cells can trigger ER stress and UPR activation in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and numerous studies report that the UPR is activated upon infection of host cells by coronavirus family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) Coronaviruses induce stress in the ER in several ways. First, conserved replicase encoded, nonstructural proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nps6 are embedded into the ER membrane, and along with unknown host factors, promote membrane curvature to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs), the site of viral replication/transcription centers (RTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In addition to remodeling the ER, coronaviruses further condition infected cells by shifting translation away from host mRNAs and instead to viral mRNAs. Translation of viral mRNAs causes the ER to be flooded with heavily glycosylated viral structural proteins [e.g., spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E)], challenging the organelle’s folding capacity and overall integrity. Indeed, overexpression of CoV spike proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) as well as several sarbecovirus accessory poteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) has been reported to induce ER stress. Finally, cell membranes are depleted as enveloped virus particles are assembled into new virions in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment before budding from the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Thus, coronaviruses as well as other enveloped viruses promote a massive ER expansion and modification necessary to replicate their genomes, transcribe mRNAs, and finally to process and package their protein products into viral particles.</p><p id="P6">We have compared the activation status and requirement of the IRE1α/XBP1 arm of the UPR in well-characterized human lung epithelial cell lines and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived type II alveolar (iAT2) cells, following infection with four betacoronaviruses representing three distinct lineages. We find that infection with MERS-CoV, OC43 and MHV leads to phosphorylation of IRE1α and the consequent production of spliced XBP1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, while we observed phosphorylation of IRE1α in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, there was notable absence of XBP1s, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 inhibits downstream signaling of the IRE1α/XBP1 arm of the UPR. In addition, we report reduced SARS-CoV-2 induced interferon signaling gene expression in the absence of IRE1α.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Induction of IRE1α phosphorylation following coronavirus infection</title><p id="P7">To determine whether betacoronaviruses activate IRE1α, we first examined the level of phosphorylated IRE1α after viral infection of the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line. We used A549 cells stably expressing the following receptors to facilitate optimal entry for each of the viruses: carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)1a or MHVR (MHV), dipeptidyl peptidase DPP4 (MERS-CoV), or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 (SARS-CoV-2). HCoV-OC43 can infect parental A549 or cells expressing ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Consistent with previous reports that embeco lineage coronaviruses MHV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and OC43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) induce ER stress, we observed a significant increase in phospho-IRE1α (p-IRE1α) during infection by either OC43 (24 or 48hpi) or MHV (24hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). To confirm the specificity of the p-IRE1α band, we pretreated cells prior to infection with KIRA8, a highly selective kinase inhibitor of IRE1α known to inhibit both autophosphorylation and consequently RNase activity. As expected, KIRA8 significantly inhibited the induction of p-IRE1α by OC43 and MHV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A&amp;C</xref>). Thapsigargin (Tg) and tunicamycin (Tm), both inducers of ER stress, were used as further controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,D&amp;E</xref>). Robust induction of p-IRE1α was observed with 1 hour of Tg (1μM) treatment, while no activation of p-IRE1α was observed after 8 hours of treatment with Tm (1μg/ mL), consistent with the negative feedback regulation observed with extended Tm treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). We also observed robust phosphorylation of IRE1α in A549-DDP4 cells and A549-ACE2 cells infected by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A&amp;B</xref>). As with OC43 and MHV, IRE1α phosphorylation during SARS-CoV-2 infection was inhibited by KIRA8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results are not limited to a single cell type as we observed similar induction of p-IRE1α in Calu-3 cells, another lung epithelial derived cells line, which can be productively infected with both MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results demonstrate that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MHV activate the host IRE1α kinase after infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MHV, OC43, MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 induce splicing of XBP1 mRNA</title><p id="P8">We next examined the effect of coronavirus infection on the RNase activity of IRE1α as assessed by XBP1 splicing. Using specific primers to quantify spliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1s), we observed a marked increase in the percentage of spliced XBP1 mRNA (% XBP1s) as well as an increase in the relative amount of spliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1s) compared to mock control after infection by OC43, MERS-CoV or MHV in receptor-expressing A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A&amp;B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A&amp;B</xref>). This induction of XBP1s by OC43 and by MERS-CoV infection was confirmed by assessing XBP1 splicing by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E&amp;F</xref>). DNAJB9, a canonical target of XBP1s, was also markedly upregulated with OC43, MERS-CoV, and MHV infection at both 24 and 48 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A&amp;B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). This induction of IRE1α RNase activity is coincident with the observed autophosphorylation of p-IRE1α upon OC43, MHV or MERS-CoV infection.</p><p id="P9">Surprisingly, despite the observed IRE1α autophosphorylation following SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was no significant upregulation of XBP1s mRNA in A549-ACE2 cells up to 52 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C&amp;G</xref>). Similarly, DNAJB9 expression levels were unchanged at all time points observed with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To confirm this effect is not limited to A549 cells, we measured XBP1 mRNA splicing in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells. Again, infection with MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, significantly induced XBP1s and its downstream effector DNAJB9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D&amp;H</xref>). In agreement with these results, OC43, but not SARS-CoV-2, infection induced XBP1s protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I&amp;J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Upon infection, MHV, OC43, MERS-CoV induce IRE1α and related genes to a greater extent than SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="P10">To determine how different coronaviruses impact the UPR at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing of A549-DPP4 cells infected with MERS-CoV for 24 and 36 hours. We compared the results to published RNA-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) of MHV infection of murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) or SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549-ACE2, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, and Calu-3 cell lines. In agreement with our IRE1α activation results, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted activation of the UPR and ER stress pathways by MERS-CoV and MHV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 consistently showed little to no activation of the UPR and ER stress pathway across different MOI conditions and cell lines.</p><p id="P11">To support the results of the gel electrophoresis splicing assays for XBP1 mRNA that distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from that of the other betacoronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), we further utilized the RNA sequencing results to quantitatively measure XBP1 mRNA splicing by these coronaviruses. Through RNA-seq, we visualized both the unspliced and spliced XBP1 mRNA reads based on whether they contain the 26 nucleotide non-conventional intron that is removed as a result of RNase activity of IRE1α as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B&amp;C</xref>). MERS-CoV infection resulted in significant XBP1 mRNA splicing, in contrast with no difference detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected versus mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B&amp;C</xref>). We further quantified total XBP1 spliced vs unspliced reads, which consistently showed a substantial increase in the percent expression of the XBP1s reads when normalized to total XBP1 reads for MERS-CoV at both 24 and 36 hours post-infection but not for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D&amp;E</xref>). This was consistent with significant upregulation of DNAJB9 and total XBP1 during infection with MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 induces XBP1 splicing during infection of biologically relevant iPSC-derived alveolar type II cells</title><p id="P12">To confirm our results in a more physiologically relevant cell, we infected iPSC-derived type II alveolar (iAT2) cells. We employed the SPC2 line, which expresses tdTomato from the surfactant protein-C (SFTPC) locus as an AT2 marker, which we have previously used to characterize innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Type II alveolar cells are a major target during both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, and their destruction may be a contributing factor to lung pathogenesis in severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate in these cells and release infectious virus as quantified by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, MERS-CoV replicated to higher titers than SARS-CoV-2 in these lung-derived cells. This complements our previous findings that SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently than MERS-CoV in upper respiratory derived primary nasal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), and may suggest that MERS-CoV is better adapted to replicate within the lower respiratory tract while SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently in the upper airway. Despite this difference in replication, both viruses were observed to induce p-IRE1α over the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In agreement with our results in A549 and Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 failed to induce XBP1 splicing in iAT2 cells, as measured by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). By contrast, MERS-CoV induced XBP1 splicing, albeit to a lower extent than in immortalized cell lines. Lastly, we visualized XBP1 splicing using RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Again, our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce XBP1 splicing at either 24 or 48hpi in iAT2 cells, despite inducing p-IRE1α. MERS-CoV, however, induced increasing XBP1 splicing over the course of infection, matching the results in A549 and Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV induce ER stress as evidenced by IRE1α phosphorylation during infection of primary iAT2 cells, but only MERS-CoV induces the downstream effects of active IRE1α RNase.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SARS-CoV-2 inhibits XBP1 splicing</title><p id="P14">We then tested whether SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits splicing of XBP1 induced by the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (TM), a common agent used to chemically induce ER stress. To do so, A549-ACE2 cells were either mock infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 or OC43 for 24 hours and then treated with TM for 6 hours prior to analysis. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 infection did not completely prevent XBP1 splicing induced by TM, it led to significantly lower XBP1 splicing levels compared with mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

To determine whether IRE1α activity is required for replication and propagation of MHV, OC43, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out IRE1α in A549 cell lines expressing receptors for each coronavirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3 A-F</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe any significant differences in the capability of all tested coronaviruses to replicate in cells lacking IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-F</xref>). These results suggest IRE1α is neither essential nor inhibitory for coronavirus replication in these cells. Since SARS-CoV-2 does not lead to IRE1α-mediated XBP1 splicing, we also tested replication of SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 does in XBP1s KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C&amp;D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3G</xref>). Consistently, there was no detectable effect of XBP1s KO on SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-OC43 replication in A549-ACE2.

Infections of A549-ACE2 cells were carried out at 33C to enable direct comparison of the two viruses [OC43 replication is significantly more robust at 33C compared to 37C, while SARS-CoV-2 replicates to a similar extent at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>)]. Principal component analysis showed a modest change in cellular gene expression upon OC43 infection of wildtype cells relative to SARS-CoV-2, which caused a robust alteration in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast to uninfected or OC43-infected cells, loss of IRE1α significantly impacted host gene expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Clustering analysis of RNA-seq data revealed 6 distinct clusters altered upon loss of IRE1α related to key cellular functions, including chromatin organization (Cluster 1), mRNA metabolism and processing (Cluster 2) and protein translation (Cluster 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). Detailed analysis of the IRE1α-mediated UPR pathway confirms activation by OC43 infection that is inhibited upon loss of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C-E</xref>). In contrast, minimal change in this pathway was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, consistent with previous results in this study. Loss of IRE1α also appears to alter other elements of the UPR in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, including some genes in the PERK and ATF6 pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), which may reflect compensatory effects on the UPR in an attempt to control proteostasis in the absence of IREα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Strikingly, we observed significantly lower induction of some interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) during SARS-CoV-2 infection of IRE1α KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B</xref>). We have previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 induces type I and type III IFN signaling and ISGs in multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Interestingly, OC43 infection did not induce notable IFN or ISG responses with or without IRE1α expression, so we were unable to make the same observations with this virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). To confirm these results, we performed RT-qPCR on representative IFN and ISG genes that we have previously reported to be upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Consistent with our RNA-seq data, we observed significantly lower induction of ISGs such as OAS2, MX1, and IFIT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells lacking IRE1α expression at both 37 C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>) and 33 C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4F</xref>). These data suggests that IRE1α may play a role in augmenting IFN signaling, while not being necessary for ISG induction, in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

The host response to severe infection with CoV is associated with marked dysfunction in the distal lung (alveolar) epithelium, which includes disruption of barrier function, dysregulated immune responses, transcriptomic reprogramming to a transitional cell state, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To better understand the host epithelial response to CoV, we systematically compared the activation of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway of the UPR during infection with betacoronaviruses in lung-derived A549 and Calu-3 cells lines and iPSC-derived AT2 cells. We employed three human viruses, each from a different betacoronavirus lineage: OC43 (embeco), SARS-CoV-2 (sarbeco) and MERS-CoV (merbeco), and included the model murine coronavirus MHV, an embecovirus. We found a striking difference between the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and the other three viruses. OC43, MHV and MERS-CoV all activated the canonical IRE1α/XBP1 pathway in both A549 and Calu-3 cell lines as evidenced by phosphorylation of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), XBP1 mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and induction of DNAJB9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), a target of XBP1s. Additionally, MERS-CoV was observed to induce IRE1α/XBP1 activation in iAT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, while SARS-CoV-2 also promoted autophosphorylation of IRE1α, there was no evidence of XBP1s, indicating that the pathway was only partially activated and suggesting that the IRE1α kinase was active while the XBP1 splicing RNase activity was not. The differential splicing of XBP1 mRNA during SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infection was also observed in iPSC-derived AT2 cells, confirming the results in a more physiologically relevant system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The difference among these viruses is surprising as all of them encode highly conserved replicase and structural proteins that promote ER membrane rearrangements and challenge the ER folding capacity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We had originally hypothesized that these conserved genes would induce similar stress on the ER and lead to UPR activation. Instead, our data suggest that that SARS-CoV-2 actively prevents XBP1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A&amp;B</xref>). Consistent with this idea, a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E protein (rSARS-CoV-ΔE) was reported to induce more XBP1 splicing as well as induction of UPR genes compared to parental wild type virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To investigate the importance of IRE1α for coronavirus replication, we evaluated replication of each of the betacoronaviruses in IRE1α KO A549 cells compared to parental wild type cells. In contrast to influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), all of the betacoronaviruses examined were able to replicate efficiently in the absence of IRE1α signaling, consistent with a previous report of the gammacoronvirus IBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This raises interesting possibilities for the role of IRE1α during coronavirus infection. As previously stated, IRE1α can produce both cytoprotective (through XBP1s) and destructive responses (via RIDD and JNK/p38 signaling) depending on the extent of the encountered stress. It seems likely that coronavirus infection would induce extensive and prolonged ER stress, which may push IRE1α beyond the initial pro-recovery responses and towards a pro-apoptotic response. Indeed, our data reveal that, at least with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, IRE1α phosphorylation is readily detectable by 24hpi and remains steady throughout the course of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A&amp;B</xref>). Additionally, unlike what has been observed with chemically induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), IRE1α phosphorylation does not appear to attenuate at any point during coronavirus infection, again suggesting a hyperactive and destructive outcome. As stated above, destruction of cells, in particular AT2 cells in the lung, may contribute to pathogenesis during coronavirus infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 appears to limit the downstream consequences of IRE1α activation, most notably XBP1 splicing via its RNase activity, and thus may be protected from this destructive phenotype. MERS-CoV may induce apoptosis redundantly in the UPR, as it has been reported that MERS-CoV induces and benefits from apoptosis mediated by the PERK arm of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To further probe the impact of IRE1α signaling on host gene expression following coronavirus infection, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of wildtype or IRE1α knockout A549-ACE2 cells infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-OC43. IRE1α deletion significantly reduced the expression of genes downstream of XBP1s during OC43 infection, as expected, with otherwise only modest changes in overall gene expression. In contrast, genetic ablation of IRE1α significantly impacted host gene expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells. The two most dramatic effects that appear to be specific to SARS-CoV-2 relate to chromatin organization and protein folding and transport. Effects on mRNA metabolism and processing are also observed for SARS-CoV-2 and, more modestly, for OC43. Finally, protein translation is down-regulated in both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells but, in the latter case, occurs primarily upon loss of IRE1α. Taken together, these results suggest that IRE1α plays a key role in mediating changes in host cell gene transcription and protein production caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P21">We found here that deletion of IRE1α modestly blunted the induction of some but not all ISGs by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, OC43 was not observed to induce significant levels of IFN or ISG mRNAs in either WT or IRE1α KO cells. The mechanism by which loss of IRE1α activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection dampens the induction of interferon signaling remains to be determined. It has been reported that the UPR can precede and prime innate immune signaling in flavivirus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). XBP1s has been found upstream of IFNα and IFNβ transcription and may work through binding upstream cis-acting enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Moreover, XBP1s can directly bind and transcriptionally activate IL-6, TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). It is possible that a low level of background XBP1 splicing may occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could contribute to these responses. Independent of its RNase activity, the autophosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of IRE1α can oligomerize and serve as a scaffold that recruits TRAF2, JNK, ASK, Nck, and other molecules that can lead to varied signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Therefore, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent full IRE1α activation might dampen inflammatory signaling and prevent detection and elimination by the immune system in an intact organism. However, it is important to note that the diminution of ISG expression in the absence of IRE1α is small for most ISGs, and SARS-CoV-2 still induces IFN and IFN signaling to a greater extent than OC43 in IRE1α KO cells. Thus, the significance of IRE1α dependent IFN signaling is not clear and will be a subject of future investigation.</p><p id="P22">Overall, despite the lack of apparent virus replication defects with IRE1α deficiency, further characterization of the repertoire of betacoronavirus induced IRE1α signaling is warranted, including contributions to cytokine production, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory responses. While we initially investigated this pathway from the perspective of the impact on virus replication, future studies should examine effects of IRE1α activation on the host, including inflammation and cell death through the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling scaffolded by IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and/or RIDD, as a consequence of prolonged IRE1α activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). These responses could be particularly important in AT2 cells, which must rely on the UPR to maintain proteostasis in the face of the challenge from the biosynthesis and secretion of surfactant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Dysregulation of these responses by coronavirus infection could promote AT2 cell reprogramming, epithelial apoptosis, alteration of surfactant components in alveoli, and the rampant inflammation associated with severe coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Finally, the UPR response is complex and made up of the PERK and ATF6 pathways in addition to IRE1α, and signals from all three of these pathways almost certainly integrate into the final outcome of an infected cell.</p><p id="P23">We recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV also diverge in their activation and antagonism of the double-stranded RNA induced host cell innate immune responses, another early innate response to viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). While MERS-CoV actively antagonizes type I and type III interferon production and signaling, the oligoadenylate ribonuclease L (OAS/RNase L) system and the protein kinase R (PKR) pathway, SARS-CoV-2 activates OAS/RNase L, PKR and induces a low level of IFN and ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Here, we observed that OC43 infection did not lead to the induction of IFN or ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>), and we have shown previously that OC43 encoded accessory proteins NS2, antagonizes of activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Activation of these pathways during MERS-CoV mutant infection significantly reduces virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), while SARS-CoV-2 can tolerate the innate responses activated during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Considering the differences we have observed between betacoronaviruses with innate immune responses and now IRE1α activation and signaling, it is striking that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are reciprocal in what they activate and antagonize. To optimize replication, coronaviruses must likely strike a balance in the cellular responses they antagonize, tolerate, or benefit from. Supporting this, our data suggest that IRE1α influences ISG induction during infection. It is intriguing to consider if MERS-CoV tolerates this by antagonizing IFN and ISG induction, while SARS-CoV-2 instead limits IRE1α activity. Future studies should examine the synergy between innate immune responses and the UPR during coronavirus infection, and how perturbations on one side may change viral replicative capacity, tropism, and spread. Understanding how signals from each one of these pathways are integrated into viral replication and cell fate decisions during coronavirus infection may illuminate new therapeutic strategies for combating emerging betacoronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P25">Human A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) and its derivatives were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco catalog no. 11875) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco catalog no. 15140).

(2010) “FastQC: A Quality Control Tool for High Throughput Sequence Data” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Raw sequencing reads from each sample were quality and adapter trimmed using BBDuk 38.73 as described by Bushnell, B at “BBTools software package” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap</ext-link>). The reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38 with Ensembl V98 annotation) using RNA STAR 2.7.1a(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The resulting BAM files were counted by featureCounts 1.6.4 to count the number of reads for each gene(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Differential expression between mock, 24hpi, and 36hpi experimental conditions were analyzed using the raw gene counts files by DESeq2 1.22.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). A PCA plot of RNA-seq samples and a normalized gene expression matrix were also generated by DESeq2.</p><p id="P34">For SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 infections, ACE2-A549 control or IRE1 KO cells were cultured in 10% FBS RPMI to 70% confluence. Cells were washed once with PBS before being mock infected or infected with each virus at MOI = 1 for one hour in serum-free RPMI at 33C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS before 2% FBS RPMI was added. At 48 hours post infection, cells were lysed with RLT Plus lysis buffer before genomic DNA removal and total RNA extraction using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen 74134). Three independent biological replicates were performed per experimental condition. RNA sample quality check, library construction, and sequencing were performed by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility following standard protocols. All samples were sequenced in two runs by a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer to generate paired-end 100bp reads. For each sample, the reads from two flow cells were combined before downstream processing. Quality and adapter trimming were performed on the raw sequencing reads using Trim Galore! 0.6.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore">https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore</ext-link>). The reads were mapped to the human genome (UCSC hg19 with GENCODE annotation) and the downstream analyses performed using the same methods as above.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Host pathway activity analysis of viruses</title><p id="P35">RNA-seq data from GSE147507(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), GSE168797 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), GSE144882 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and above were used to compare effects of different viruses on host ER stress response. Specifically, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis</ext-link>) was used to predict activities of related canonical pathways based on host gene expression changes following viral infection.

deaths world-wide. Other common coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 cause less severe respiratory disease. Thus, it is imperative to understand the similarities and differences among these viruses in how each interacts with host cells. We focused here on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) pathway, part of the host unfolded protein response to virus-induced stress. We found that while MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 fully activate the IRE1α kinase and RNase activities, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1α, promoting its kinase activity but not RNase activity. Based on IRE1α-dependent gene expression changes during infection, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 prevents IRE1α RNase activation as a strategy to limit detection by the host immune system.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Coronavirus family.</title><p>Phylogenetic tree of betacoronaviruses and their lineages.

In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection only partially activates IRE1α through autophosphorylation but prevents the activation of the RNase activity. XBP1s maintains a low basal level upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. MERS, OC43 and MHV efficiently antagonize dsRNA induction of IFN signaling.
