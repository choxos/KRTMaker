It nevertheless remains time-consuming and expensive to identify antibodies with diverse binding modalities against druggable candidate molecules. Although new genomics-based pipelines have potential to augment antibody discovery, these methods remain in their infancy due to an incomplete understanding of the selection process that governs B cell clonal selection, expansion and antigen specificity. Furthermore, it remains unknown how factors such as aging and reduction of tolerance influence B cell selection in murine models of immunization. Here we perform single-cell sequencing of antibody repertoires and transcriptomes of B cells following immunizations with a model therapeutic antigen target (human Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, TNFR2). We determine the relationship between antibody repertoires, gene expression signatures and antigen specificity across 100,000 B cells. Recombinant expression and characterization of 227 monoclonal antibodies revealed the existence of clonally expanded and class-switched antigen-specific B cells that were more frequent in young mice. Although integrating multiple repertoire features such as germline gene usage, somatic hypermutation, and transcriptional signatures failed to distinguish antigen-specific from non-specific B cells, other features such as IgG-subtype and sequence composition correlated with antigen-specificity. This work provides a single-cell resource for B cells relating antibody repertoires, transcriptomes and antigen specificity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The importance of antibodies in drug development has promoted interest in developing more rapid and efficient methods for monoclonal antibody discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Huggett 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Weiner 2015</xref>). Traditionally antibody discovery has relied heavily on experimental screening approaches such as hybridomas, phage or yeast display and more recently B cell cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hoogenboom 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wilson and Andrews 2012</xref>); however the emergence of genomics methods and in particular deep sequencing and bioinformatics are also contributing to antibody discovery (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Parola, Neumeier, and Reddy 2018</xref>). For example, deep sequencing of antibody repertoires from immunized mice has been used to identify clonally expanded plasma cells that are associated with antigen specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddy et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al. 2015</xref>). Additionally, the emergence of single-cell sequencing (scSeq) technologies has made it possible to identify endogenously paired variable heavy (VH) and variable light chain (VL) regions from single B cells at high-throughput, which can be used to subsequently reconstruct antibodies for experimental testing (DeKosky et al. 2013; DeKosky et al. 2015). For example, our group recently performed scSeq of plasma cells following immunization or viral infection in mice, and subsequent expression and screening of antibodies from highly expanded clones was shown to correlate with antigen-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Neumeier et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>). A similar approach was applied to plasma cells isolated from convalescent Covid-19 individuals and led to the discovery of a panel of antibodies, including potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Ehling et al. 2022</xref>). An innovative approach based on B cell selection with DNA-barcoded antigens followed by scSeq (LIBRA-seq) has been effective for the rapid isolation of antibodies against multiple antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Setliff et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shiakolas et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Further development of scSeq methods has made it possible to obtain both transcriptome and antibody (or B cell receptor, BCR) repertoire information from single B cells at high-throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Croote et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Horns, Dekker, and Quake 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saikia et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Singh et al. 2019</xref>), thereby enabling an integrated analysis of B cell transcriptional phenotypes within the context of antibody clonal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yermanos, Agrafiotis, et al. 2021</xref>). This integrated scSeq approach was recently used to identify a large and diverse population of antigen-specific B cells from convalescent Covid-19 individuals, leading to the discovery of highly potent neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cao et al. 2020</xref>). Although this work demonstrates the promise of integrated scSeq for viral antigens, it remains unknown how antibody repertoire and transcriptome features can be used to identify antigen specific B cells, especially within the context of challenging therapeutic target antigens, such as self-antigens that are often targets for autoimmune disease or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fischer, Kontermann, and Pfizenmaier 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Medler and Wajant 2019</xref>). The discovery of antigen specific B cells to antigens with high homology to self proteins may be potentially enhanced through immunization in aged individuals, as previous studies have demonstrated that the redistribution of B cell subsets that occurs during aging may favor the formation of antibody responses towards self-antigens (Frasca et al. 2017; Colonna-Romano et al. 2009; Hao et al. 2011). Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the potential loss of negative selection occurring with immunosenescence can improve the ability to identify diverse populations of antigen-specific B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rubtsov et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Watad et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dunn-Walters 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, we perform integrated scSeq of antibody repertoires and transcriptomes of B cells isolated from mice immunized with a model therapeutic protein antigen (human TNFR2) followed by antibody-antigen specificity profiling at high-throughput. We generate a single-cell atlas of ~100,000 B cells and experimentally screen 227 antibodies, thereby uncovering signatures associated with antigen-specific B cells. Importantly, only in young mice were clonally expanded B cells found to be strongly associated with antigen-specific antibodies, with very few observed antigen-specific B cells discovered in the older cohort. In addition to supporting the discovery of a diverse panel of antigen-specific B cells against a therapeutically relevant target, scSeq can also relate functional properties of antibodies to repertoire and transcriptional features and gain greater insight on B cell selection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Clonal expansion is detected in young and old mice following immunization</title><p id="P5">To profile B cell selection following serial protein immunizations, we immunized a cohort of 3-month-old (3m) male C57BL6 mice (n=5) with five successive injections of 10 μg of the extracellular domain of human TNFR2 mixed with 20 μg of the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). Our previous findings demonstrated that immunization of young mice with an immunogenic protein antigen (ovalbumin) results in highly expanded plasma cells within the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>). For this study, we selected an antigen that has potentially reduced immunogenicity given its high sequence similarity (~61.3%) to the murine homologue of TNFR2. As aging may be linked to a more antigen experienced immune repertoire (encounter of higher number of antigens throughout life) together with an increased production of autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ratliff et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Elkon and Casali 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that immunization with TNFR2 in aged mice could potentially trigger stronger memory B cell responses against self antigens with high sequence similarity, such as human TNFR2. Furthermore, it has been observed that antibody forming B cells in aged mice exhibit higher absolute numbers in certain organs following cognate antigen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Han et al. 2003</xref>). Hence, we additionally performed the same immunization schemes with additional cohorts of 12-month-old (12m) (n=3) and 18-month-old (18m) (n=3) male C57BL6 mice. With the exception of one mouse in the young cohort, all mice exhibited high antibody titers against TNFR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We isolated bone marrow plasma cells (BM PCs) (CD138<sup>hi</sup>, TACI<sup>hi</sup>) and spleen B cells (CD19<sup>hi</sup>, IgM<sup>low</sup>, IgD<sup>low</sup>) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and performed single-cell antibody repertoire and transcriptome sequencing using the 10x genomics 5’ immune (VDJ) profiling pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following library preparation, deep sequencing and alignment to reference VDJ genes, we recovered a total of ~65,000 cells containing exactly one heavy chain and one light chain, with an average of 3,200 cells per mouse. The majority of cells were of the IgM isotype for both spleen and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells were grouped together based on sharing identical heavy and light chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3+CDRL3) amino acid sequences (hereafter referred to as clone), resulting in a few hundreds of unique clones for each mouse or organ repertoire. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the BM PC repertoires demonstrated extensive clonal expansion, with approximately 75% of clones being expanded (clones supported by more than one cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). On the other hand, we observed that the majority of splenic B cell clones were not clonally expanded, as they possessed only a single cell barcode, which was comparable across all three age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). While the majority of expanded clones for BM PCs were IgM, spleen repertoires had an extensive presence of IgG subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Nevertheless, clonally expanded cells of IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes were still present in both organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5, S6, S7</xref>). Previous single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing studies suggest a strong correlation between class-switched clones and the number of amino acid sequence variants existing within an individual clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Pedrioli, et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>). Here, we observed that the number of cells for the most expanded IgG and IgA clones demonstrated a minor correlation with the number of amino acid variants, whereas some IgM clones contained a considerable number of amino acid variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, we did not observe any differences in clonal expansion, isotype distribution or the number of amino acid variants between the different age groups.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Single-cell sequencing reveals organ and isotype transcriptional heterogeneity</title><p id="P7">Next, we leveraged the capabilities of scSeq to integrate transcriptome information with antibody repertoire features. To this end, we performed unsupervised clustering and uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) on the combined data set (all cells across all mice and cohorts), which gave rise to 14 distinct cell clusters based on global gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10</xref>). Examination of the transcriptional space clearly distinguishes between clusters populated principally by cells derived from either bone marrow or spleen, or clusters with cells originating from both organs at similar ratios (clusters 8, 9 and 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9B</xref>); a high degree of reproducibility was observed across samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9C</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis was used to define specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Mathew et al. 2021</xref>). Not surprisingly, this demonstrated that cell clusters associated with bone marrow were characterized almost completely by plasma cell markers, which was in contrast to the splenic transcriptional space where multiple distinct B cell phenotypes were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overlaying isotype information onto the UMAP revealed separation of IgG-, IgM-, IgA- and IgD-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis revealed exclusive genes defining IgG (<italic>ApoE, Gimap4</italic>), IgA (<italic>Ccr10, Glpr1</italic>), IgD (<italic>Sell, Fcer2a</italic>) and IgM (<italic>Ggh, Slc3a2</italic>) isotypes, some of which are consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Pedrioli, et al. 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next determined if there are age-associated transcriptional changes between young and old mice. We restricted our analysis to the 3m and 18m cohorts and quantified differential gene expression separately for each organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed for both bone marrow and spleen a substantial downregulation in young mice of <italic>AC133103.1</italic>, an uncharacterised gene marker, and substantial upregulation of <italic>Eif3f</italic> which has been implicated in protein translation and cell growth with its expression significantly decreased in many human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Marchione, Leibovitch, and Lenormand 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Shi et al. 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We determined if expanded B cell clones were transcriptionally distinct compared to non-expanded clones (clones supported by only one single cell). Due to the high heterogeneity of the splenic B cell population, we focused our analysis on BM PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We focused on the most expanded clones that possessed cells mostly with an IgG subtype, as these have been previously shown to be preferentially associated with antigen specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>). We used a previously established system for rapid antibody cloning and expression in mammalian cells by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Cristina Parola et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pogson et al. 2016</xref>). The resulting antibodies, representing 204 unique IgG clones, were then screened by ELISA for binding to the TNFR2 antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed that in young mice, there was a considerably higher fraction of antigen-specific clones compared to older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B, 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This was most apparent in BM PC repertoires, where approximately 31.3% of clones tested (31 out of 99) from young mice were antigen-specific, in contrast to only 7.1% (4 out of 56) in older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the spleen we also detected 21.4% (6 out of 28) and 14.2% (3 out of 21) antigen-specific clones for young and old mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, independent of age and organ, we observed that a higher degree of clonal expansion was not correlated with antigen specificity, as antigen-specific and non-specific clones were evenly distributed throughout the most expanded clones of each repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B, 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Having discovered TNFR2-specific antibody sequences among clonally expanded cells, we next determined whether clones present in multiple organs of the same mouse would exhibit antigen-specificity. These organ-overlapping clones showed higher levels of clonal expansion when compared to clones observed in only one organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We expressed and determined the antigen specificity of several of these organ-overlapping clones, some of which coincided with previously expressed expanded clones (marked with a star(*) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>). This revealed that approximately 33% (12/37) of organ-overlapping clones were also antigen-specific.

Furthermore, antigen specificity and clonal expansion were not correlated across organ-overlapping clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast to the correlation observed between age and antigen-specificity in the clonally expanded cells, we did not observe any age associated biases to antigen specificity within the organ-overlapping antibody pool.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Investigating immune repertoire and transcriptome features of antigen-specific BM PCs</title><p id="P11">We next determined whether repertoire or transcriptome features could differentiate between recently activated TNFR2-specific clones and non-specific ones. We focused our computational analysis on the BM PCs due to the higher number of experimentally validated antibodies with specificity to TNFR2. We initially quantified the mean number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) per clone in the full-length VH and VL regions, which revealed that, on average, the TNFR2-specific fraction of clones exhibited lower levels of SHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we visualized the distribution of IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG1B, IgG2C, IgG3) which showed a higher percentage of the IgG1 subtype among the antigen-specific fraction of clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>), an observation that was also reflected on the cellular level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13A</xref>). We next sought to relate TNFR2 specificity to germline gene usage. Visualizing the distribution of heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) V gene usage across TNFR2-specific and non-specific sequences did not suggest any TNFR2-associated biases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13B</xref>). We further determined if certain VH-VL germline combinations were enriched in the antigen-specific or non-specific fraction. Circos plots of the experimentally verified antigen-specific and non-specific clones did not show enrichment for certain V gene combinations in either of the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The same observation was made when looking at other germline features, such as the J gene usage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13C</xref>). To investigate whether sequence convergence could be detected within the binding fraction of TNFR2-specific clones, we initially visualized the amino acid sequences for the most frequent CDRH3 and CDRL3 lengths. This initially revealed little indication of amino acid or biochemical bias between antigen-specific and non-specific sequences within the CDR3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13D</xref>). Next, we constructed sequence similarity networks based on the edit distance of CDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Miho et al. 2018</xref>), which demonstrated that antigen-specific clones demonstrated clustering across a range of edit distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13E</xref>). Some of these antigen-specific clusters contained clones utilizing different germline genes despite similar CDR3s, potentially suggesting convergent sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next investigated whether distinct gene expression profiles could be detected between TNFR2-specific and non-specific clones, as these signatures could correspond to genes involved in recent recruitment and migration compared to long-lived BM PCs present prior to immunization. Following differential gene expression analysis, we observed significantly expressed markers, both when including all TNFR2-specific sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>) and when restricting our analysis to the different age cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S14B</xref>). This, however, did not reveal any meaningful differences in transcriptional signatures between antigen-specific and non-specific cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Here, we used single-cell antibody repertoire and transcriptome sequencing to investigate the extent that repertoire features can be leveraged to discover antigen-specific antibodies from immunized mice. scSeq allowed us to relate individual transcriptomes to the antibody repertoire for nearly one hundred thousand B cells, thereby providing large-scale insight into the relationship between gene expression, clonal selection, and antigen specificity. We observed comparable levels of clonal expansion in repertoires from both young and aged mice following serial immunizations with human TNFR2. In addition, we observed class-switched antibodies among the most expanded clones in both spleen and bone marrow repertoires.</p><p id="P14">The emergence of scSeq workflows has made it possible to comprehensively test and reconstruct the specificity of antibodies based on their immune repertoire profiles. Using antibody expression and screening, we were thus able to demonstrate that a fraction of expanded cells in the repertoires of young mice produced antibodies with specificity to TNFR2 following immunization. This fraction was comparable to our previous results in the context of immunization with OVA, where approximately 45% of the most expanded clones were found to be antigen-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>). Moreover, our results demonstrate an increased proportion of clonally expanded B cells that were not antigen-specific in aged mice, suggesting that immunization-induced clonal expansion fails to exceed levels present in naive repertoires. This decrease of antigen specificity in aged mice may be linked to previous reports that naive B cell repertoires have restricted clonal diversity in aged individuals or that IgM+ B cells accumulate in the bone marrow during aging, thereby reducing available space for newly recruited B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gibson et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Miller and Allman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Mehr and Melamed 2011</xref>). Other parameters linking immune senescence to a decreased number of antigen-specific plasma cells could involve alterations of pro-B/pre-B proliferative capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Min, Montecino-Rodriguez, and Dorshkind 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Shahaf, Johnson, and Mehr 2006</xref>), a decline of number and size of germinal centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zheng et al. 1997</xref>) and deficiencies in class-switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Frasca et al. 2004</xref>). Further measuring of affinities and, in the case of antiviral immunizations, neutralization potential, would be beneficial to assess how aging impacts the quality of the antibody response. In addition, we observed that antigen specificity was largely stochastic and could not be predicted based on the clonal rank of expanded cells in both young and old mice, which is in accordance with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Yermanos, et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Having discovered TNFR2-specific sequences using clonal expansion and clonal overlap, we integrated single-cell transcriptomes with antibody repertoires in an attempt to investigate whether other factors could be incorporated into the selection criteria such as Ig isotype, SHM or transcriptional signatures. We focused on the BM PC repertoires due to the higher number of experimentally validated antibodies with specificity to TNFR2. These repertoires remain particularly interesting since plasmablasts, short- and long-lived PCs significantly contribute to circulating antibodies present in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nutt et al. 2015</xref>). This comparison revealed that TNFR2-specific PCs had minor differences in immune repertoire features and similar transcriptional profiles to non-specific PCs. More specifically, our data suggested that antigen-specific clones were less mutated in the V- and J-regions and preferentially expressed the IgG1 subtype. We expected that immunization would lead to clear transcriptional differences relating to recent selection between TNFR2-specific and non-specific PCs. However, we observed minor transcriptional differences between these two populations of cells when performing unsupervised clustering and differential gene expression analysis. Transcriptional differences were however observed in IgM-, IgD-, IgA- and IgG-expressing B cells, which was consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neumeier, Pedrioli, et al. 2021</xref>), as well as expansion-specific transcriptional clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kuhn et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yermanos, Neumeier, et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing provides a detailed molecular quantification of clonal selection.

In contrast, there is limited information regarding the behavior of humoral immunity triggered by an antigen with high host-sequence similarity, which are common therapeutic targets for indications such as cancer and autoimmune disease. Therefore our results have implications for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies targeting such therapeutic antigens, such as TNFR2, which is implicated in pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Medler and Wajant 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fischer, Kontermann, and Pfizenmaier 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Mouse experiments</title><p id="P17">All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and Swiss federal regulations.

Raw reads were aligned to the germline segments from the GRCm38 reference (vdj_GRCm38_alts_ensembl-3.1.0) and subsequently assigned into clonal families based on identical combinations of CDRH3+CDRL3 nucleotide sequence via cellranger. Further filtering was performed to include only those cells containing exactly one heavy chain and one light chain sequence. Firstly, clonotypes containing identical CDR3 amino acid sequences were merged into the same clonal family. Clonal frequency was determined by counting the number of distinct cell barcodes for each unique CDR3. Those cells in clones supported by only one cell were considered unexpanded clones, whereas those clones supported by two or more cells were considered expanded. Clone variants were determined as those sequences with the exact same VH and VL. SHMs were determined as nucleotide substitutions in the V and J regions. Clonal overlap was calculated based on identical amino acid CDRH3+CDRL3 sequences between any two or more repertoires. Germline gene usage was determined by cellranger’s vdj alignment to the murine reference. V and J gene combinations were calculated and visualized with circos plots using the VDJ_circos function in Platypus (v2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yermanos, Agrafiotis, et al. 2021</xref>) with a label.threshold of 2 or 5. Isotype was determined based on the constant region alignment per cell or for the majority of cells within each clonal family. In the case that the variable region alignment was provided but the isotype was not recovered, the isotype was labeled as “Unknown”. Jaccard indices were calculated by quantifying the intersection between two groups divided by the length of the union of the same groups. Similarity networks were calculated based on the VDJ_network function in Platypus (v2.1), which first calculates the edit distance separately for HC and LC CDR3s, and then draws edges between those clones with a distance below the specified threshold. ROC curves, AUC scores and confusion matrices were generated using the PlatypusML_feature_extraction_VDJ function in Platypus using the aa sequences of the CDRH3+CDRL3 regions.

Only those cells containing less than 20% of mitochondrial reads were retained in the analysis. All BCR related genes (V(D)J genes, isotype constant regions, J-chain) were filtered out prior to further analyses. Data was normalized using a scaling factor of 10000 and variable features were found using 2000 genes. Cluster resolution was set to 0.5 and the first fifteen PCR dimensions (determined via visualization of the normalized Seurat object using an elbow plot) were used for neighborhood detection. UMAP was performed again using the first fifteen PCA dimensions. All repertoires were proceeded and filtered together. Genes defining clusters were determined by setting the min.pct argument equal to 0.25 using Seurat’s “FindMarkers” function. For analyses involving B cells found in repertoire sequencing data, only those cells containing identical nucleotide barcodes sequences were included and reanalyzed in the Seurat object.

Specificity was validated by performing normalized supernatant ELISAs against the extracellular domain of human TNFR2 (Peprotech, 310-12 and in-house production). Flow cytometry phenotyping of hybridoma cells was performed on a BD FACS Aria III. Typically, 5×10 cells were stained for 30 minutes on ice in 50 μl of a labeling mix consisting of anti-IgG2c-AlexaFluor488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-545-208) and anti-IgK-Brilliant Violet421 (BioLegend, cat# 409511) at 1:100 and 1:50 dilutions, respectively. Before acquiring, cells were washed twice. For ELISA experiments, 0.2 μm sterile-filtered cell culture supernatant of a 6d culture was used to confirm TNFR2 specificity. ELISA plates were coated with the capturing reagent (TNFR2 or control) in PBS at 4 μg/ml, blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% (w/v) milk (AppliChem, A0830) and incubated with cell culture supernatant.
