In yeast cells, cohesin is not only required for sister chromatid cohesion but also plays a major role in determining the structure of individual chromatids in metaphase. Separase cleavage is thought to remove all cohesin complexes from chromosomes to initiate anaphase. It is thus not clear how the length and organisation of segregating chromatids are maintained during anaphase in the absence of cohesin. Here we show that degradation of cohesin at the anaphase onset causes aberrant chromatid segregation. Hi-C analysis on segregating chromatids demonstrates that cohesin depletion causes loss of intrachromatid organisation. Surprisingly, TEV-mediated cleavage of cohesin does not dramatically disrupt chromatid organisation in anaphase, explaining why bulk segregation is achieved. In addition, we identified a small pool of cohesin complexes bound to telophase chromosomes in wildtype cells and show that they play a role in the organisation of centromeric regions. Our data demonstrate that in yeast cells, cohesin function is not over in metaphase, but extends to the anaphase period when chromatids are segregating.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitotic chromosome condensation solves two structural problems during chromosome segregation: firstly, it eliminates entanglements between replicated chromatids, and secondly, it compacts chromosomes so that they avoid being cut by the cytokinetic furrow at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guacci et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, it is very important that cells control chromosome length during anaphase, ensuring that chromatids are sufficiently compacted.</p><p id="P3">Cohesin complexes were first proposed to impact on genome architecture both by providing cohesion between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>) and promoting chromosome condensation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>). The discovery that separase cleaves cohesin’s kleisin Mcd1/Rad21/Scc1 subunit (thereafter referred to as Mcd1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>) and the observation that engineered Mcd1 cleavage in metaphase, using TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease expression and TEV recognition sites in Mcd1, triggered bulk separation of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>) established the view that yeast cohesin functions solely holding sister chromatids together prior to their separation. However, recent work has shown that the original observation demonstrating a structural function for yeast cohesin in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>) was indeed correct. Chromosome capture (Hi-C) techniques have revealed that cohesin mediates intrachromosomal loops that are responsible for compacting yeast chromosome arms in metaphase cells, independently of cohesin’s role in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to yeast cells, cohesin is not required to organise the arms of metaphase chromosomes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>). Although cohesin is fully responsible for the organisation of the genome into loops during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), it dissociates from chromosome arms during prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>). At metaphase, mammalian cohesin is only retained at centromeres where it provides cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>), while the related SMC complexes, condensin I and II (CI and CII), take over the role of folding mitotic chromosome arms into loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). CII organises large (200- to 400-kb) loops, while CI sub-divides these into smaller loops (80-kb)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). During interphase CI is excluded from the nucleus and CII although nuclear, is prevented from acting on chromosomal DNAs by a nuclear protein, Mcph1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Yeast cells lack a condensin II complex, and condensin I’s role in chromosome organisation in mitosis is restricted to the ribosomal gene array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>).

Here, we have investigated this question. We have studied the organisation of chromosome arms during segregation while we compromised cohesin function using two contrasted experimental approaches; auxin-mediated degradation and TEV-mediated cleavage of Mcd1. We demonstrate that degradation of Mcd1 severely disrupts chromosome structure and consequently the segregation of chromatids in anaphase. In addition, we show that a population of cohesin complexes are present on segregating chromatids during anaphase/telophase and that they are important for centromere organisation. Together, these findings demonstrate that yeast cohesin has a previously unsuspected role necessary for the faithful segregation of chromatids during anaphase.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid degradation of cohesin’s kleisin at the anaphase onset causes mitotic catastrophe</title><p id="P6">To study the role of cohesin on chromosome organisation during anaphase, we searched for an approach to induce the rapid removal of cohesin’s kleisin subunit, Mcd1. To this aim, we used an auxin-inducible degron allele of Mcd1 (<italic>MCD1-AID</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) which allows rapid degradation by poly-ubiquitylation upon exposure to auxin. To evaluate the effect of Mcd1 degradation during chromatid segregation, we blocked cells using transcriptional depletion of Cdc20 (an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex, APC). Under this experimental condition, cells are arrested with chromosomes bipolarly attached to mitotic spindles. Removal of cohesion by artificial cleavage of Mcd1 in Cdc20-depleted cells triggers an anaphase-like state where chromatids segregate to opposite cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In cdc20-arrested cells, we observed full degradation of Mcd1-aid 30-60min after addition of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), demonstrating the rapid and efficient removal of Mcd1 in this experimental setup. Auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1 led to severe disruption of nuclear segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), with many nuclei appearing to be stuck in anaphase with elongated nuclear masses for extended periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>). To quantify the segregation defects in these cells, we introduced chromosome tags at different genomic locations, and scored the timing and efficiency of their separation. First, we used tags on the arm (<italic>tetO::469</italic>) and telomere (<italic>tetO::558</italic>) regions of chromosome 5, a small chromosome in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>). After 180min of auxin addition to cdc20-blocked cultures, we observed that 48% of the cells were still stuck in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), 35% of cells showed correct segregation of arm tags and 20% showed misegregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Segregation errors were even higher for telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and larger chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1a-b</xref>). These results demonstrate that rapid removal of Mcd1 by degradation causes a catastrophic anaphase-like state with severely impaired separation of chromatids.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TEV-induced cleavage of cohesin allows bulk genome separation with minor segregation errors</title><p id="P8">Previous studies have shown that engineered cleavage of Mcd1 in cdc20-arrests, using TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease expression and TEV recognition sites on Mcd1, triggers an anaphase-like division where nuclear masses separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). We evaluated segregation in TEV-induced anaphases using the previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Induction of TEV expression led to cleavage of Mcd1 after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) as expected. Bulk nuclear segregation occurred 90-120 min following the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>) as it had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, chromosome tags located on the centromere region of chromosome 5 segregated efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Therefore, unlike auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1, TEV-cleavage allows nuclear segregation.</p><p id="P9">We noticed that in TEV-induced anaphases the cleaved C-terminal fragment of Mcd1 was fully stable during the entire time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The lack of Mcd1 fragment degradation after TEV cleavage stems from the fact that TEV protease cleavage occurs following the glutamine (Q) residue of the TEV recognition site (‘ENLYFQ*G’) leaving a glycine (G) amino-acid residue at the N-termini (referred to as TEVG), which is not well recognized by the N-rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). In contrast, separase cleavage leaves an arginine (R) residue at the N-termini of the cleaved product (‘SVEQGR*R’), which is a good substrate for N-end rule degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Beckouet et al. have shown that following TEV-induced cleavage not only the C-terminal fragment of Mcd1 is stabilised but also the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beckouet et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that Mcd1 fragments could remain associated to the Smc core subunits following TEV cleavage. To test whether this is the case, we tagged Smc3 with the V5 epitope and Mcd1 with FLAG and HA tags at the N- and C-terminus respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We performed IPs on synchronised TEV-anaphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) to follow whether the cleaved fragments stay associated to the cohesin Smc core. Both N- and C-terminal Mcd1 fragments were immunoprecipitated by Smc3 after TEV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, the structural integrity of cohesin tripartite complex remains intact after TEV cleavage of its kleisin subunit. Next, we sought to test whether inducing full degradation of Mcd1 fragments after TEV cleavage generated a similar phenotype to that observed in anaphases induced by degradation of Mcd1-aid with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To this aim, we used a TEV recognition site on Mcd1 that was able to yield a C-terminal fragment with a terminal amino-acid recognized by the N-end rule pathway. We found this to be the case when we used the TEV recognition site ‘ENLYFQF’ (referred to as TEVF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This site leaves a phenylalanine, rather than a glycine, as the N-terminal aminoacid after TEV cleavage. Importantly, N-terminal phenylalanine is a good substrate for N-end rule degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). We used FLAG and HA tags at the N- and C-terminus of Mcd1, respectively, to detect the two products generated by TEV cleavage and compared their stability in Mcd1 proteins containing the classical ‘ENLYFQG’ (TEVG) or ‘ENLYFQG’ (TEVF) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Cleavage of TEVG generated stable N- and C-terminal fragments observed before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast, both N- and C-terminal fragments were rapidly degraded after cleavage on TEVF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we compared segregation kinetics in TEV-induced anaphases with TEVG and TEVF cleavage sites. Bulk nuclear separation was observed in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>), with most cells showing full segregation after 120 min of TEV induction (&gt;85% in TEVG and &gt;75% in TEVF). However, we noticed minor delays during anaphase progression in cells with TEVF recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we compared the fidelity of segregation in TEVG and TEVF anaphases using tetO:469kb tags inserted in the middle of chromosome 5. As observed previously, cells carrying TEVG recognition sites segregated tags correctly (with &lt;5% missegregation observed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, tag missegregation was observed in 16% of telophases when TEVF recognition sites were present on Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that degradation of Mcd1 fragments after TEV cleavage affects the fidelity of chromosome segregation but, unlike Mcd1 degradation, does not severely prevent bulk nuclear separation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Depletion or cleavage of cohesin differentially affect chromatin structure and segregation</title><p id="P12">Cohesin mediates intrachromosomal loops in metaphase arrested chromosomes, providing a structural framework for the compaction of chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). How chromosomes are organised during yeast anaphase, when individual chromatids are being pulled to the poles, is not well understood. Since the cohesin tripartite complex remains associated after TEV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), we considered the possibility that TEV-cleaved cohesin retains a role in maintaining the structure of segregating chromatids. To further investigate this, we first performed ChIP analysis of Smc3 during TEV-induced anaphases along chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We observed that significant levels of chromatin-bound Smc3 remained during initial timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>; TEV-induced). In contrast, Smc3 was rapidly lost from chromatin in anaphases induced by auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>; auxin-induced). Having observed that TEV-cleaved cohesin remains chromatin-bound for significantly longer periods than auxin-degraded cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), we decided to use these two conditions to investigate the organisation of chromatid structure. To this aim, we built Hi-C libraries from timepoints when the bulk of Mcd1 had been either TEV-cleaved or auxin-degraded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>). Following sequencing, we computed the corresponding normalized genome-wide contact maps for Mcd1-TEV and Mcd1-aid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>). When we compared the contact maps of individual chromosomes obtained from cells arrested in metaphase using Cdc20 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), to those obtained for Mcd1-TEVG and Mcd1-AID during the induced anaphases, we observed a decrease in intrachromosomal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). The contact probability (P) as a function of genomic distances of all chromosome arms showed a reduction of contacts in the 10-30kb range for Mcd1-TEVG and Mcd1-AID samples compared to Cdc20 arrests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). Notably, the reduction in Mcd1-AID was significantly more pronounced than in Mcd1-TEVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that a structural role persists after TEV cleavage, but not Mcd1 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cohesin organises centromeres of telophase arrested chromosomes</title><p id="P13">Our results demonstrate that the fidelity of chromosome segregation requires the maintenance of cohesin-dependent structure during anaphase. Next, we investigated whether cohesin complexes are removed in fully segregated chromosomes when they reach the cell poles in telophase. To this aim, we first fused the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the cohesin subunit Smc3 and imaged its localisation on telophase arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Smc3-GFP signal was observed on segregated nuclei, with a discrete dot present at the cell poles that colocalised with the spindle pole body protein Spc29 (Spc29-RedStar2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This suggests that Smc3-GFP might be enriched at centromeric regions of telophase chromosomes. To confirm this possibility, we used calibrated ChIP-seq in <italic>cdc15-2</italic> arrested cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref>) to identify whether centromeric regions and any other potential genomic sites are bound by cohesin. To have a guide for the positions where cohesin is normally enriched, we used Smc1 localisation on cells arrested in metaphase where cohesin binding is maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To ensure that signals detected in telophase arrests were not due to background noise, we subtracted the signal obtained using untagged cells in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The number of cohesin binding sites per chromosome was dramatically reduced in telophase arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), and only a few arm sites exhibited levels above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Comparison of average profiles across CEN sites confirmed our cytological results demonstrating that cohesin is indeed enriched at these regions in telophase arrested chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

We then build Hi-C libraries from cells arrested in telophase with and without degradation of cohesin after the arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>). Comparison of the contact maps revealed changes at centromeric regions in telophase cells depleted for cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>), including a decrease in isolation of CEN-proximal regions from other sites down chromosome arms <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). These results demonstrate that cohesin complexes influence intrachromatid contacts at centromeres in telophase chromosomes.

Separase function is highly regulated to prevent its premature activation before every single chromosome has been aligned on the mitotic spindle. Firstly, separase activity is blocked by a bound inhibitor named securin (Pds1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>), which is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis once cells are ready to enter anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cohen-Fix et al., 1996</xref>). Secondly, separase-mediated cleavage of Mcd1 is primed by Polo-kinase (Cdc5) dependent phosphorylation of Mcd1 at serines 175 (S175) and 268 (S268), at the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alexandru et al., 2001</xref>). This double regulation ensures that cohesion is not destroyed before it should be. At the anaphase onset, Mcd1 cleavage by separase is thought to terminate the function of cohesin on yeast chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, cohesin’s subunits have been shown to be chromatin-bound during anaphase/telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Renshaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>), however the functional contribution of this population has not been studied.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to yeast, sister chromatid cohesion in mammals is maintained throughout G<sub>2</sub>. At the onset of mitosis, loosening of arm cohesion accompanies the compaction of each chromatid along its longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Waizenegger et al., 2000</xref>). Mammalian cohesin organizes the genome into loops during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Rao et al., 2017</xref>) but dissociates from chromosomes in prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>), and it is only found at centromeres by the time cells reach metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>). The role of organising loops on mammalian metaphase chromosomes is taken over by condensin I and II (CI and CII) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). During chromosome segregation, CI and CII are believed to maintain the structure of separating chromatids to prevent a “cut” phenotype, which occurs when insufficiently condensed chromatids are trapped by the cytokinetic furrow. In yeast, there is a single condensin complex that does not play a role in the overall organisation of chromosome loops during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>), instead it has a very defined function organising the ribosomal gene array on chromosome XII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>). Since yeast condensin does not contribute to the structural organisation of chromosome arms and cohesin’s function is thought to stop at the anaphase onset, it was unclear how separating chromatids maintain the looped organisation necessary for chromosome compaction and faithful segregation.</p><p id="P19">Here, we tested the belief that cohesin has no roles after metaphase. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to the current view, degrading Mcd1 during anaphase leads to catastrophic segregation where many cells arrest with unseparated nuclear masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a-d</xref>). This result prompted us to further investigate (i) whether the structure of segregating chromatids is disrupted when Mcd1 is degraded and (ii) whether cleavage of cohesin subunit Mcd1 causes a similar phenotype to its degradation. Hi-C analysis during segregation demonstrated that Mcd1 degradation causes dramatic defects in the 10-30kb range of <italic>cis</italic> interactions on chromatids, which correspond to cohesin-dependent loop range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This result confirms that loops are lost when cohesin is not present on segregating chromatids and offers an explanation for the catastrophic segregation observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To study the effect of cohesin cleavage on the efficiency and structure of segregating chromatids we used the TEV protease system previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Our analysis revealed that unlike Mcd1 degradation, TEV-induced cleavage does not prevent bulk nuclear separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), although it causes some segregation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Importantly, we could detect the maintenance of <italic>cis</italic> contacts in 10-30kb range on chromosomes with TEV-cleaved Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) demonstrating that chromatid loops are not fully disrupted and explaining why bulk segregation is achieved. An important difference between cohesive cohesin and loop extruding complexes lies in the way that these complexes interact with the DNA substrate. While cohesive cohesin topologically embraces DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>), loop extruding complexes rely on non-topological interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that cohesin complexes cleaved by TEV are still able to interact non-topologically with the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>) and/or can maintain extruded loops. This would explain why TEV-cleavage has only a modest effect on the structural role of cohesin, while disrupting the cohesive role (that depends on topological association) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). In contrast, auxin-mediated degradation would abolish both topological and non-topological interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>) which would result in the loss of cohesion but also structure (and compaction) thus generating a situation where unorganised chromatids would fail to efficiently segregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Based on evidence that suggested a role for cohesin during segregation we sought to investigate whether a small pool of cohesin was retained on chromosomes in telophase. Interestingly, we detected binding to centromeres in this late mitotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a and c</xref>). Importantly, depletion of cohesin in telophase revealed that bound cohesin during this late mitotic stage is still influencing the structural organisation of pericentromeric regions, as well as promoting interactions between <italic>CEN</italic>-regions of different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b-d</xref>). Further to this role at centromeric regions, we observed condensation defects at the ribosomal gene array on chromosome XII when we inactivated cohesin function in telophase-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a-b</xref>) demonstrating that the complex also plays a role in the organisation of this genomic site during late mitosis.</p><p id="P22">Currently, the roles of yeast cohesin during mitosis are thought to include; (i) the pairing of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), (ii) the bipolar organisation of chromatids as they attach to the mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>) and (iii) the organisation of metaphase chromosomes into looped domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work has shown that cohesin is necessary for the maintenance of the structure of the rDNA during metaphase and that this role is executed through the regulation of condensin localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lamothe et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, all the above roles occur in metaphase cells and the cleavage by separase at the anaphase onset has generated the perception that cohesin’s roles are over at the beginning of anaphase. Collectively our data demonstrates that yeast cohesin plays important roles during segregation by maintaining the looped organisation of segregating chromatids and supporting centromere organisation. Therefore, these findings extend the repertoire of cohesin jobs on chromosomes and demonstrates that this complex has important post-metaphase functions critical for ensuring faithful genome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Yeast strain</title><p id="P23">Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

TEV cleavage of Mcd1 could be retained in one of the two segregating chromatids maintaining some of the structural functions. In this scenario sister chromatid cohesion would be lost but the loop organisation of individual chromatids would be partially maintained, thus facilitating segregation. <bold>d,</bold> Diagram showing a potential model explaining how degradation of cohesin subunit Mcd1 could lead to catastrophic segregation. Mcd1 degradation leads to the destabilisation of cohesin on chromatin. In the absence of cohesin, though cohesion is dissolved (allowing genome separation), the loss of structure on separated chromatids would prevent their segregation and cells would exhibit the anaphase bridges phenotypes observed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS145142-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
