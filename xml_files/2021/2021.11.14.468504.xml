However, its practical applications in tissue engineering requires a detailed understanding of how different printing parameters (concentration of resins, laser dose) affect cell activity and tissue formation. Herein, we explore a new application of VBP in bone tissue engineering by merging a soft gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) bioresin (&lt;5 kPa) with 3D endothelial co-culture to generate heterocellular bone-like constructs with enhanced functionality. To this, a series of bioresins with varying concentrations of GelMA and lithium Phenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphinate (LAP) photoinitiator were formulated and characterized in terms of photo-reactivity, printability and cell-compatibility. A bioresin with 5% GelMA and 0.05% LAP was identified as the optimal formulation for VBP of complex perfusable constructs within 30 s at high cell viability (&gt;90%). The fidelity was validated by micro-computed tomography and confocal microscopy. Compared to 10% GelMA, this bioresin provided a softer and more permissive environment for osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The expression of osteoblastic markers (collagen-I, ALP, osteocalcin) and osteocytic markers (podoplanin, Dmp1) was monitored for 42 days. After 21 days, early osteocytic markers were significantly increased in 3D co-cultures with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, we demonstrate VBP of a perfusable, pre-vascularized model where HUVECs self-organized into an endothelium-lined channel. Altogether, this work leverages the benefits of VBP and 3D co-culture, offering a promising platform for fast scaled biofabrication of 3D bone-like tissues with unprecedented functionality.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS145115-f007"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tomographic volumetric bioprinting</kwd><kwd>bioresins</kwd><kwd>bone tissue engineering</kwd><kwd><italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenesis</kwd><kwd>endothelial co-culture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) aims to develop three-dimensional (3D) cellular constructs that mimic physiological tissue structure and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].

The ability of volumetric bioprinter from Readily3D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] to rapidly fabricate 3D cell-laden constructs elucidated its superiority to traditional extrusion-based 3D printers. This supremacy is justified by the very short printing time (&lt;1 min) for centimeter-scale constructs with micrometer-scale resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video S1</xref>).</p><p id="P40">The VBP process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>. After cell harvesting, hMSCs were mixed with GelMA/LAP resin formulations at 37 °C in a glass vial. Next, the bioresins were cooled down to 4 °C for 15 min to form a physically crosslinked cell-laden gel before bioprinting at ambient temperature. Since the bioprinting process was fast, the resin formulation remained solid. After warming to 37 °C for 10 min, the printed constructs were obtained and transferred to cell culture media.</p><p id="P41">Firstly, we sought to characterize and identify optimal bioresin compositions for hMSC-based bone tissue engineering that support a high level of cell viability, 3D osteogenic differentiation and structural stability of the hydrogels after bioprinting. The rationale for GelMA as bioresin of choice is based on its excellent cell-compatibility and its frequent use in 3D cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The printing of different centimeter-scale 3D models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>) with reliable performance was achieved using resins with GelMA concentrations of 2.5%, 5% and 10% in combination with varying photoinitiator (LAP) concentrations (0.03%, 0.05%, 0.08%). Constructs with hollow channels (0 &lt; 1 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>) were designed and printed with the aim to be adoptable for future perfusion dynamic culture studies. High-resolution 3D reconstructions of the printed models were generated through micro-CT scans with a voxel resolution of 34 μm, and were used to visually confirm the printing precision. The STL model channel diameters in the range of 1 mm could be precisely recreated, although scaled shrinkage of the printed constructs was observed after incubation in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, iv = 1 mm, <bold>B,</bold> i,ii,iii = 1.2 mm before and 0.9 mm after bifurcation). These findings show that soft hydrogel constructs with hollow architecture, which traditionally could only be printed with additional supporting structures in multiple steps, can be easily fabricated in single step by VBP within seconds.</p><p id="P42">To achieve high print fidelity, the optimal laser settings have to be determined and validated regularly because the functionalization degree and reactivity of GelMA bioresins show batch variation, and changes of physicochemical properties within one batch with ongoing warming cycles and premature polymerization. To mimic the volumetric printing process, a multi-step rheology measurement of a resin (5% GelMA, 0.05% LAP) was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). By cooling the sample from 37 °C to 4 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, both storage (G') and loss modulus (G") was monitored. A sol-gel transition was observed at 16 °C. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to UV-LED 365 nm irradidation (10 mW/cm<sup>-2</sup>) for covalent crosslinking of GelMA via free radical polymerization, which resulted in a rapid increase in shear modulus (G’ ~ 3.2 kPa, G” ~ 450 Pa) after 5 min irradiation.</p><p id="P43">Laser dose tests spanning a broad range of average light intensities were used to identify an appropriate light dose that enables highest printing resolution. The required light dose also depends on the power of the inbuilt lasers in the different printer prototypes used in this study, as well as on the diameter of the printing vessel (8 mm/18 mm). Generally, required light doses are inversely correlated to GelMA and LAP concentration whereby the latter has a greater effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The required light dose for printing a bioresin with 10% GelMA and 0.08% LAP was approximately 180 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the dose required for another bioresin with 2.5% GelMA, 0.03% LAP was approximately 550 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. All other tested GelMA/LAP concentration combinations were printable within this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The required light dose directly correlates with the printing duration. However, the printing time does not increase when scaling up the construct volume as long as the same irradiation intensity is supplied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, even light doses above 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> achieved complete polymerization of constructs with a volume of more than 10 cm<sup>3</sup> in less than one minute.</p><p id="P44">Although a broad range of GelMA/LAP concentrations were printable, only a few resin compositions were suited for elaborate experimental procedure requiring manual handling. While the seminal study on VBP by Bernal et al. reported a stiff matrix (24 kPa) made of 10% GelMA, we reasoned that a lower mechanical stiffness and thus enhanced matrix permissiveness are essential for cell-matrix remodeling and hMSC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Construct stability mainly depends on GelMA concentration. Bioresins containing 5% GelMA were chosen for future experiments as a good tradeoff between lower stiffness compared to 10% GelMA, and improved gel stability compared to 2.5% GelMA. Furthermore, the printability of a bioresin containing 2.5% GelMA and 2.5% sacrificial gelatin (total gelatin concentration of 5%) was confirmed. Aiming for an <italic>in situ</italic> softening environment, these constructs are expected to exhibit time-dependent decrease of gel stiffness and enlargement of porosity with ongoing incubation and resultant release of gelatin. Interestingly, all GelMA constructs with sacrificial gelatin at varying LAP concentrations showed enhanced ALP expression compared to the control group, implying the improved permissiveness. However, it is important to note that this improvement was accompanied with the compromise on surface smoothness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). With this information in mind, 5% GelMA without sacrificial gelatin was determined as the optimal resin for further experiments since it combines high print fidelity and ease of handling. Additionally, cellular constructs with 5% GelMA showed enhanced osteogenic differentiation reflected by the increased relative gene expression of the osteocytic marker gene PDPN compared to constructs with a GelMA concentration of 10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><label>3.2</label><title>Effect of photoinitiator concentration</title><p id="P45">We investigated whether the LAP concentration in combination with the respective light dose influences printing fidelity as indicated by surface smoothness and cell-compatibility. Construct staining with the freely diffusible, fluorescent dye Eosin Y allowed confocal microscopic imaging at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). From a side view, linear structures could be observed as printing artifacts at any concentration but no differences in surface smoothness from neither side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, i-iii) nor top view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, iv-vi) could be observed. This observation suggests that GelMA-based bioresins have excellent printability provided the light dose and photoinitiator concentrations are carefully selected.</p><p id="P46">Thereafter, we investigated the physical properties of hydrogel constructs by <italic>in situ</italic> photo-rheology and Zwick mechanical characterization to test if matrix stiffness affects cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A-C</xref>). The crosslinking efficiency of the bioresins were assessed by time-lapsed <italic>in situ</italic> photo-rheology with UV-365nm irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). The evolution of storage (G') and loss (G") moduli was monitored at an interval of 10 s. All compositions reached a G'-plateau in the range of 850 Pa - 1850 Pa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) after an irradiation for 4 min. No significant differences in the G'-plateau moduli were observed between the 0.03% and 0.05% LAP groups. However, the gels with 0.08% LAP exhibited the highest stiffness. Moreover, the sample with 0.03% LAP reached the onset (G' &gt; 5 Pa) at ca.116 s, whereas the onset time for the other two groups was significantly shorter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). Nevertheless, a comparison with t<sub>90%-G'</sub>, the time required to reach 90% of the G'-plateau value, showed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). Together, the 0.03% LAP group has the lowest photoreactivity, whereas higher LAP concentrations accelerated the photocrosslinking.</p><p id="P47">Additionally, the compressive moduli of 3D printed acellular GelMA constructs after swelling was determined with a Zwick mechanical testing machine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Stiffness differences between the scaffolds with the two lower (0.03% and 0.05% LAP ≙ 5 kPa) and the one higher (0.08% LAP ≙ 8 kPa) LAP concentration were observed, although not being statistically significant. These results are consistent with the previously reported observations of faster crosslinking due to higher number of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P48">Next, we varied LAP concentrations to investigate the influence of LAP and the respective required light dose on cell-compatibility and permissiveness of printed hydrogel environments with cell viability and morphology assays. A high cell viability of &gt;92% after 7 days was reached for all constructs without differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). However, remarkable differences were observed when assessing the morphology of embedded cells after an actin-nuclei staining. Cell spreading with fine dendritic processes could be observed after 7 days for the samples with 0.03% and 0.05% LAP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video S2</xref>), whereas cells remained round in 0.08% LAP containing gels. This suggests that higher LAP concentrations, and the thereby increased exposure of cells to free radicals might pose toxic effects to the cell fidelity without affecting viability directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Although previous studies have evidenced negligible cytotoxic effects of soluble GelMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and LAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], a thorough assessment of possible phototoxicity mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] during UV irradiation is warranted in future investigations. The observation of increased cell spreading was confirmed by an increased cell surface area in constructs with lower LAP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Mono-cultures of HUVECs were used as the control. Importantly, neither considerable amounts of ALP enzyme activity, nor reasonable expression of any of the relevant osteogenic genes could be observed in HUVEC mono-cultures. Therefore, the contribution of HUVECs to total osteogenic gene expression levels in co-cultures was neglected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>). Generally, all osteoblastic marker genes were expressed throughout the cultivation time, indicating ongoing osteogenic differentiation.</p><p id="P51">At the early stage of osteogenesis, hMSCs showed a higher expression of several osteogenic markers in the mono-cultures.

Although on day 1 it was higher expressed in mono-cultures, after 21 days the level of expression significantly increased in the co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP, is a proteolytic enzyme involved in matrix remodeling during osteogenesis and is predominantly active in mature osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. It was continuously highly expressed and no significant differences between co- and mono-cultures could be observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). Together, at the early stage of 3D osteogenesis most osteoblastic marker genes showed a higher level of expression in mono-cultures and then a trend of enhanced gene expression in co-cultures at later timepoints was identified. These findings imply the temporal dynamics of gene expression in 3D osteogenesis as well as the significant role ofjuxta- and/or paracrine signaling in cell activity.</p><p id="P54">In accordance with this trend, marker genes of early osteocytes were increasingly expressed in 3D co-cultures. The early osteocytic marker gene <italic>PDPN</italic> codes for a transmembrane glycoprotein which is important for dendrite elongation. After day 21, it was consistently higher expressed in 3D co-cultures compared to mono-cultures with the highest reached expression levels after 42 days. Moreover, the early osteocytic marker DMP1, a regulator for matrix mineralization, was higher or exclusively expressed in co-cultures compared to mono-cultures, especially in a later stage after day 21. No expression of the marker gene <italic>SOST</italic> for mature osteocytes was observed at any time point. Similar to the effects observed on the expression of osteoblast markers, co-cultures tend to the enhance expression of early osteocytic marker genes.</p><p id="P55">To confirm the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene expression, an ALP activity assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref>). HUVEC controls showed no considerable ALP activity which allowed direct comparison between 2D/3D mono- and co-cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). ALP activity in 3D was not matched to the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene expression patterns and rather stable expressed in both, mono- and co-culture, during the whole observation time. ALP activity in co-cultures was generally increased compared to mono-cultures with significant differences on day 7 and day 42.</p><p id="P56">The differences in gene expression and enzyme activity between mono- and co-cultures we also monitored in 2D cultures, additionally to the characterization of 3D printed constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the effects of co-cultures on osteogenic differentiation being less prominent in 2D cultures compared to 3D. This observation can be explained by the potential of 3D environments to allow endothelial self-organization into vasculature-like structures, and related alterations in signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. However, further validation by cell tracing, cell tracking and molecular analysis is required to prove this hypothesis. Presence of a self-organized vasculature-like network would promote cell-cell communication, nutrient transport and tissue maturation for a long-term functional 3D culture, even though top-seeding approaches onto porous scaffolds are still frequently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Additionally, it has to be noted that a direct comparison of 2D and 3D cultures in this study can only be done with a certain reluctance since cell number, spatial organization, culturing environment and RNA isolation techniques differed significantly.</p><p id="P57">Gene expression analysis and enzymatic assays are powerful tools to assess construct functionality. But especially for bone tissue formation, the level of matrix mineralization is an important indicator. To evaluate this, we followed matrix mineral deposition by time-lapsed micro-CT scans. Printed mono- and co-cultures were cultivated in bioreactors and scanned weekly for 6 weeks, but no sufficient mineralization could be visualized at any time point. Thus, we investigated whether other matrix parameters such as the gel mechanics changed over time. Changes in the compressive moduli of 3D co-culture samples were monitored by mechanical testing on day 1, 7 and 28 after printing. Here, the compressive moduli of the gel constructs increased from about 6 kPa (d1) to 13 kPa (d7) and 46 kPa (d28), with an 8-fold increase between day 1 and 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, an increasing level of gel turbidity was observed during 3D co-culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). These results imply that there has been remarkable level of matrix secretion during 3D co-culture. Nevertheless, future work is warranted to investigate if there are remarkable differences in mineral formation between co-culture and mono-culture and to devise strategies to promote tissue maturation with a higher level of mineralization.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><label>3.3</label><title>Volumetric bioprinting of pre-vascularized constructs</title><p id="P58">Given the promise of our 3D bioprinted co-culture platform, we further explored VBP of a perfusable pre-vascularized bone construct.

advantages of tomographic volumetric bioprinting (VBP) and endothelial co-culture. After screening the properties of a series of photocurable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) bioresins, a formulation with 5% GelMA was identified with optimal printability and permissiveness for osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). We then established 3D endothelial co-cultures to test if the heterocellular interactions may enhance the osteogenic differentiation in the printed environments. This hypothesis was evidenced by increased gene expression of early osteocytic markers in 3D co-cultures after 21 days. Finally, VBP of a perfusable cell-laden tissue construct is demonstrated for future applications in vascularized tissue engineering.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Illustration of tomographic VBP and enhanced stem cell osteogenic differentiation by endothelial co-culture.</title><p><bold>A)</bold> Schematic of VBP: Tomographic light projections lead to localized solidification of hydrogel constructs in a glass vial containing a cell suspension in a photo-crosslinkable bioresin (GelMA/LAP).
