Very few classes of antifungal drugs have been approved for clinical use to treat these diseases and resistance to the first line therapeutic class, the triazoles, is increasing. A new class of antifungals that target pyrimidine biosynthesis, the orotomides, are currently in development with the first compound in this class, olorofim in late-stage clinical trials. In this study, we identify an antagonistic action of the triazoles on the action of olorofim. We show that this antagonism is the result of an azole induced upregulation of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and regulation. Intriguingly, we show that loss of function in the higher order transcription factor, HapB a member of the heterotrimeric HapB/C/E (CBC) complex or the regulator of nitrogen metabolic genes AreA, leads to cross resistance to both the azoles and olorofim indicating that factors that govern resistance are under common regulatory control. However loss of azole induced antagonism requires decoupling of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in a manner independent of the action of a single transcription factor. Our study provides a first insight into antagonism between the azoles and olorofim through dysregulation of the pyrimidine and ergosterol pathway, showing complex crosstalk between these two pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aspergillus fumigatus</kwd><kwd>Olorofim</kwd><kwd>Orotomide</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>Antifungal</kwd><kwd>Transcription factor</kwd><kwd>Aspergillosis</kwd><kwd>Antagonism</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Metabolic rewiring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Invasive and chronic forms of aspergillosis affect over 3 million people resulting in excess of 300 thousand deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Only three classes of antifungals are currently available to treat aspergillosis, with the triazoles used as first-line therapy in most centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Resistance to the azoles is rising, which is linked to use of triazole compounds in agri- and horticulture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. It is predicted that more resistant <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> will be seen as azole use will be expanded to combat climate change-associated to increasing fungal crop damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The development of novel classes of antifungals will be a key component to addressing the emerging resistance problem. Fortunately, there are a number of drugs that represent novel classes of antifungal currently in development for treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) including ibrexafungerp, which has recently (2021) gained FDA approval for treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, fosmanogepix which targets GPI anchor biosynthesis and olorofim (phase 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Olorofim (formerly known as F901318 and under development by F2G, Ltd.) is of particular interest as like fosmanogepix, it has a novel mechanism of action that has not been exploited clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. As olorofim is orally bioavailable it presents a realistic alternative to the azoles for long-term treatment of chronic and allergic infections and especially resistant infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Moreover, it could potentially be used in combination therapy strategies to supress the emergence of resistance.</p><p id="P3">Olorofim acts by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), encoded by the <italic>pyrE</italic> gene in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, which is a crucial enzyme within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and is thus required for both DNA and RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Structural and biochemical analysis of DHODH suggests olorofim competes with CoQ to bind to DHODH, preventing the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. DHODHs are grouped into 2 classes according to sequence similarity and subcellular localisation. Both mammals and most fungi have class 2 DHODH, which is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The human DHODH only shares 30% protein sequence identity with the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> DHODH and olorofim has also been demonstrated to be &gt;2,200-fold more potent against the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway by olorofim prevents the germination of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia and causes hyphae to undergo morphological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Prolonged exposure of germlings and vegetative hyphae to olorofim also causes extensive isotropic expansion that is then followed by cell lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Olorofim has an effect on a wide range of fungi and has been shown to be effective against <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic>, <italic>Scedosporium</italic> spp., <italic>Madurella mycetomatis</italic>, <italic>Lomentospora prolificans</italic> and several <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, olorofim has a reduced activity against <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> species complex and <italic>Fusarium dimerum</italic> and is inactive against Mucorales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].

In several murine models of aspergillosis, olorofim treatment significantly reduced fungal burden and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].. Reassuringly, a recent study suggests that levels of resistance to olorofim in a collection of clinical isolates of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is low.</p><p id="P5">Only 1 of 976 clinical isolates exhibited pre-existing olorofim resistance caused by a single SNP in the <italic>pyrE</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this study, we identify a concerning antagonistic effect of the triazoles on the action of olorofim in <italic>A. fumigatus.</italic> We show that this antagonistic effect is governed by an azole induced upregulation of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.

Through screening the COFUN <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> transcription factor null mutant library we identify four transcription factors that regulate susceptibility to olorofim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Existing published literature, and our phenotypic and transcriptomic data revealed these transcription factors regulate genes involved in processes immediately upstream of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Notably two transcription factor null mutants, Δ<italic>hapB</italic> and Δ<italic>areA</italic>, have elevated MICs to olorofim and are resistant to the azole class of antifungals, highlighting potential routes to cross resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fungal strains</title><p id="P7">Conidia of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> MFIG001 (a derivative of CEA10) and transcription factor null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] were prepared by inoculating strains in vented 25cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks with Sabouraud Dextrose agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) and incubating at 37°C for 48 hours.

The MIC was defined as the minimum concentration of olorofim at which no germination from <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spores was observed. Microscopic evaluation revealed the MIC of olorofim to be 0.06 mg/L for <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> MFIG001, consistent with previous findings of other <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The effect of olorofim on growth of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> was further evaluated by measuring optical density of the plates used to determine the MIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). The maximal growth observed (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.39) and minimal growth observed (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.04) was separated by a 64-fold difference in drug concentration, showing the effect of olorofim is progressive over a long range of concentrations until achieving total growth inhibition. This is in stark contrast to the inhibitory effects of the azoles on <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> where the difference between maximal and minimal growth typically occurs over a drug concentration not exceeding 8-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). As this range is so broad, we consider it useful to measure the concentration at which growth is inhibited by 50% (herein referred to as IC50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] to distinguish from MIC50 which is an MIC determination made of populations). For MFIG001, the IC50 for olorofim is 0.0057 mg/L whereas for itraconazole its 0.21 mg/L. As olorofim inhibits pyrimidine biosynthesis, it would be expected that the action of the drug would be fully reversed by supplementing the media with an excess of exogenous pyrimidines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. To confirm growth inhibition was due to directly targeting the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, the MIC was determined with the addition of 10 mM uridine and 10 mM uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Under these conditions there was no observed reduction in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> growth, and at all olorofim concentrations the median OD<sub>600</sub> did not fall below control levels indicating that there are no significant off target effects of this drug.</p><p id="P19">Resistance to the clinical azoles has become a global problem that is being addressed in multiple centres by using combination therapy with either an echinocandin or amphotericin B. If approved for use, olorofim may be used in the same way. We therefore investigated the potential interaction in activity between the triazoles; voriconazole and itraconazole, and olorofim against CEA10, MFIG001 and a TR34 L98H azole-resistant isolate generated in the MFIG001 background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. To our surprise given the distinct mechanisms of action of the orotomides and the azoles, we observed a clear uni-directional antagonism by the azoles on olorofim in both liquid and solid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). Interestingly we did not see the same antagonism between olorofim and manogepix, another late stage antifungal compound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). The antagonism of the azoles to olorofim was also observed under non-growth inhibitory concentrations of voriconazole for the TR34 L98H azole-resistant isolate, showing that this antagonistic response is independent of the azole antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To gain an understanding of the potential mechanisms driving this antagonism, we evaluated transcriptomic data for <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> MFIG001 exposed to increasing concentrations of itraconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). As expected, the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway was differentially regulated throughout itraconazole concentrations. At sub-MIC levels of itraconazole we observed a significant upregulation of genes in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and those pathways that generate its precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Data 1</xref>). Most strikingly, the nitrate assimilation pathway, <italic>glt1</italic> and the first three steps in the pyrimidine pathway (encoded by <italic>glnA</italic>-AFUB_070010, <italic>pyrD</italic>-AFUB_085720 and <italic>pyrABCN-AFUB_077330</italic> and its orthologues <italic>AFUB_025880</italic> and <italic>AFUB_054340</italic>) were upregulated in sub-MIC levels of itraconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>); interestingly many of these genes were downregulated in supra-MIC concentrations of itraconazole suggesting metabolic arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].

This simultaneous decrease in azole and olorofim susceptibility suggests suggesting a higher level regulatory link between ergosterol biosynthesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis. DevR is a bHLH transcription factor involved in sporulation and melanin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The Δ<italic>devR</italic> mutant showed a significant reduction in susceptibility to olorofim at concentrations ranging from 0.008 mg/L to 0.06 mg/L (MIC) and had an IC50 of 0.025 mg/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Although the MIC for this strain increased to &gt;0.125 mg/L most spores did not germinate at this concentration.</p><p id="P23">One isolate (ΔAFUB_056620, Δ<italic>acdX</italic>) showed a reproducible significant increase in sensitivity to olorofim and had an MIC of 0.03 mg/L and a IC50 of 0.006 mg/L, 2-fold lower than <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> MFIG001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). The <italic>acdX</italic> gene encodes a 612 amino acid transcription factor that contains six WD40 repeat units but no other functional domains, as shown by a SMART domain search. A reciprocal BLAST of the AFUB_056620 protein sequence found a match to the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> transcription factor Spt8. However, the proteins only share 44% identity of the entire protein sequence. In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> Spt8 forms part of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] which is known to act as a transcriptional activator under several stress conditions. While the orthologue of AcdX in other fungi generally contain six WD40 domains, in species such as <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>A. terreus</italic> only five domains are present, however the significance of this is unclear. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> AcdX has been described to be functional in the SAGA complex and is involved in repressing genes in in acetate metabolism and has a regulatory role in the proline metabolic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Transcription factor mutants with altered suseptibility to olorofim have defects in nitrogen assimilation</title><p id="P24">Further phenotypic analysis of the null mutants with differential susceptibility to olorofim revealed that all had differential growth on <italic>Aspergillus</italic> Complete Medium (ACM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a and b</xref>) and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> Minimal Medium (AMM), which contains ammonium tartrate as nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a and c</xref>). The <italic>hapB</italic>, <italic>devR</italic>, <italic>areA</italic> and <italic>acdX</italic> null mutants showed a reduction of radial growth on ACM of 28%, 22%, 12% and 24% respectively when compared to the isotype control (p&lt;0.05). On AMM, the <italic>hapB</italic> mutant showed increase radial growth (58%) however; colony growth was more diffuse than the isotype strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a and c</xref>). As olorofim inhibits DHODH, which acts within the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway we hypothesised that these growth defects could be reflecting an alteration in the abundance of precursors of this pathway. Substitution of ammonium tartrate to nitrate did not rescue any of the growth defects of the transcription factor null mutants, and even exacerbated them in Δ<italic>hapB</italic> and Δ<italic>areA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Glutamine supplementation rescued the growth rate defects of Δ<italic>acdX</italic> and Δ<italic>areA</italic> although significant growth defects were still present even after supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). Similarly, urea almost completely rescued Δ<italic>acdX</italic> and proline fully rescued Δ<italic>hapB</italic>, Δ<italic>devR</italic> and Δ<italic>acdX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f and g</xref>). Taken together, these results show that these transcription factor null mutants have defects in nitrogen utilisation that, given its connection with the pyrimidine pathway, could be linked to olorofim susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Changes in susceptibility to olorofim in ΔdevR and ΔacdX mutants are caused by opposing regulation of pathways preceding pyrimidine biosynthesis</title><p id="P25">To facilitate our understanding of how these transcritpon factors are functioning to alter olorofim sensitivity we performed whole transcriptome analysis. Upon olorofim exposure (1x MIC) for 1 hour, a modest 41 genes and 185 genes were up- and downregulated Log2 fold &gt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) in our isotype-type strain, respectively. Our expectation was that several genes in the immediate pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway would be upregulated but only the gene encoding the multifunctional carbamoyl-phosphate synthase/aspartate carbamoyltransferase (PyrABCN, AFUB_077330) enzyme, which is upstream of DHODH and converts carbamoyl-P to N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, was upregulated by Log2 fold &gt;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Data 1</xref>). Instead, genes associated with pathways that synthesise precursors of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway were identified including oxaloacetate metabolism and glutamate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Data 1</xref>). Genes associated with tyrosine metabolism; secondary metabolite biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation were enriched among downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). A STRINGS analysis of differentially regulated genes showed an interconnected network of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, the TCA cycle and nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In order to characterise the basis of differential olorofim susceptibility in the Δ<italic>devR</italic> and Δ<italic>acdX</italic> mutants the transcriptomes of these two mutants were compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Data 2</xref>). In the absence of olorofim 510 and 137 genes were respectively downregulated and upregulated in the Δ<italic>devR</italic> isolate while 212 were downregulated and 194 upregulated upon olorofim exposure. In the absence of olorofim, notable enriched functional categories included downregulation of genes involved in tyrosine metabolism and an upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids and metabolism of arginine and proline, the latter of which was also seen under olorofim exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). A detailed pathway analysis under olorofim challenge of genes involved in the conversion of metabolites towards L-glutamate and through to orotate revealed that proline uptake and degradation were upregulated in the <italic>devR</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b and d</xref>). Other pathways that contribute to orotate precursors were also significantly upregulated, notably the nitrate assimilation pathway (NAP [<italic>crnA</italic>, <italic>niaD</italic>, <italic>niiA</italic>]), and glutamate, glutamine and carbomyl-P synthesis. Pathways that compete with orotidine biosynthesis for L-glutamate were not differentially regulated in any of the assessed mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Data 2</xref>). Our transcriptional data therefore suggests that nitrogen metabolism is probably altered in this strain in ways that favor the generation of precursors for orotate biosynthesis and hence could explain the reduced sensitivity of <italic>devR</italic> null mutant to olorofim. The transcriptome of the olorofim hypersensitive Δ<italic>acdX</italic> mutant also revealed that proline and arginine metabolism were upregulated compared to the wild-type but genes involved in the NAP and glutamate, glutamine and carbomyl-P synthesis pathways were downregulated suggesting that AcdX and DevR have directly opposing functions on these linked pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>) and providing further evidence to suggest that regulation of these pathways is important for olorofim sensitivity.</p><p id="P27">Our transcriptomic data and the phenotype of the null mutants led us to assess the effect of pyrimidine pathway precursors on olorofim susceptibility in the transcription factor null mutants. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> will utilise glutamine as a preferential nitrogen source, even in the presence of other nitrogen containing compounds such as nitrate as pathways that process these precursors are repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Intriguingely however, when nitrate was added to the glutamine containing RPMI-1640, the sensitivity of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> to olorofim increased indicating that even in the presence of preferential nitrogen sources, nitrate can initiate an adaptive response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). In the olorofim resistant, nitrate non-utilising strain Δ<italic>areA</italic>, addition of nitrate to RPMI reduced susceptibility levels back to that seen for the wild-type. For the Δ<italic>devR</italic> isolate, where the nitrate assimilation pathway as well as all other pathways leading to pyrimidine biosynthesis are upregulated, addition of nitrate did not reduce olorofim susceptibility. The olorofim hypersensitive <italic>acdX</italic> null was the most impacted by changes in nitrogen sources, and counter-intuitively given the downregulation of the NAP in this strain, by the addition of nitrate reduced olorofim susceptibility. These data, combined with results from our transcriptomic analysis suggest that modification of environmental nitrogen sources and or dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism directly impacts changes in olorofim sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Azole mediated antagonism of olorofim is linked to dysregulation of pyrimidine precursor pathways but is not mediated by transcription factors that govern drug resistance</title><p id="P28">Next, we assessed if the transcription factor null mutants with differential susceptibility to olorofim retained antagonism by voriconazole. To our surprise, antagonism was not affected in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). This indicates that antagonism is more complex and potentially requires multiple regulatory factors. This led us to hypothesise that we could affect antagonism by unlinking the pyrimidine pathway from the transcriptional effect of the addition of sub-MIC concentrations of azole. Therefore, we replaced the promoters of <italic>glnA</italic> (AFUB_070010), <italic>pyrABCN</italic> (AFUB_077330) and its paralogues AFUB_025880, <italic>pyrD</italic> (AFUB_085720) and <italic>pyrE</italic> (AFUB_026780) with the doxycycline-regulatable promoter (tetOFF). As expected, replacing the native promoter of <italic>pyrE</italic> with the highly expressing and inducible tetOFF promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 6a</xref>), susceptibility to olorofim reduced dramatically when assessed by broth microdilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). In keeping with our hypothesis that genes upstream of <italic>pyrE</italic> are also important in mediating olorofim susceptibility, modest but reproducible decreases in susceptibility were also observed when the promoters of either <italic>pyrABCN</italic> or <italic>pyrD</italic> were replaced. Next, we assessed susceptibility of these mutants on solid medium using a disk assay. Strikingly under the same conditions, susceptibility of the strains to the azoles increased, suggesting that if resistance to olorofim is induced by upregulation of this pathway, strains may well be hypersensitive to the azoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To ensure there was no significant impact on changing the susceptibility of the azoles in our assessment of antagonism in our plate assay, doxycycline levels were titrated to ensure the halo induced by olorofim and voriconazole was almost identical to that of MFIG001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 6b</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis that azole induced antagonism is mediated by the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway antagonism was reduced in a step-wise manner within genes of the pyrimidine pathway, and completely ablated in the tetOFF:DHODH, regardless of the amount of doxycycline used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, we have identified a high-level coordination of the regulation of azole and orotomide resistance, seemingly caused by a crosstalk between the control of the ergosterol and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways. These pathways are induced in the presence of the azoles resulting in an antagonistic effect on the novel DHODH inhibitor olorofim.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Olorofim is a novel antifungal, currently in phase 3 clinical trials. It has a broad spectrum of activity against most moulds and acts by inhibiting the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway through disruption of DHODH activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Our preliminary analysis of the inhibitory effects of olorofim revealed that the MIC and the IC50 were separated over a relatively large concentration range (5-fold). This contrasts with what is seen with itraconazole and other azoles where this concentration spread is typically 2-fold. The clinical implication of this finding remains unclear, however it is likely that olorofim will support clearance of an infection at doses well below the MIC. At these lower concentrations however, exposure to drug will be imparting selective pressure and has the potential to induce the production of mutagenic precursors that may drive the emergence of resistance as has been shown for several antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. As with other anti-infectives that act by inhibiting a single biological target there is clear potential for emergence of resistance. Understanding these mechanisms will provide a framework for development of diagnostics to detect resistance rapidly in the clinic.</p><p id="P32">Our previous survey of itraconazole sensitivity in the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> COFUN transcription factor knockout library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] revealed 6 null mutants that had decreased sensitivity (ranging from 4 to 6-fold increase in MIC compared to the isogenic control) and 6 had increased sensitivity (4 to 8-fold decrease in MIC) to itraconazole. Here our screen revealed that only 1 mutant (Δ<italic>acdX</italic>) showed increased sensitivity while 3 showed decreased sensitivity (Δ<italic>hapB</italic>, Δ<italic>devR</italic>, Δ<italic>areA</italic>) to olorofim and the changes in sensitivity in these isolates were less extreme than seen for the azoles indicating that the frequency of olorofim resistance maybe lower than that seen for itraconazole. Indeed this hypothesis is supported by a recent study that revealed the frequency of olorofim resistance is variable between strain ranging from 1.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup>_6.9 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, while for itraconazole resistance occurs at an order of magnitude higher (1.2□×□10<sup>-6</sup> and 3.3□×□0<sup>-8</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. It is unsurprising, given the mechanism of action of olorofim, that the transcription factors that we have identified in this screen either have well defined roles in regulating nitrogen utilisation or have been linked to this function in our study.</p><p id="P33">What is remarkable however given the distinct mechanisms of actions of the two compound classes, loss of function of either of AreA and HapB results in cross-class resistance to both the azoles and orotomides. HapB is a member of the heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) and alongside HapC and HapE regulates the expression of over a third of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] including several genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. The <italic>hapB</italic> null displayed the highest levels of resistance to olorofim and was able to germinate at 0.12 mg/L, which is 8-fold higher than the parental isolate but within the concentration range needed for clinical utility. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> AreA is a positive regulator of many genes that are required for utilisation of nitrogen sources other than glutamate or ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] with loss of function resulting in an inability to utilise amongst other nitrogen sources, nitrate, nitrite, uric acid and many amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Reassuringly however, drug concentrations in animal models are tolerated well above the increased MIC levels of the null mutants identified in this screen. Dosing 8 mg/kg at 8 hour intervals in mice results in peak serum levels of 2.5-3 mg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Olorofim can be tolerated at doses as high as 30 mg/kg intravenously, giving scope for higher drug levels <italic>in vivo</italic> if required. In cynomolgus monkeys a single oral dose of olorofim resulted in peak levels of 0.605-0.914 mg/L in serum for female and male animals, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p id="P34">Our studies have shown there is a clear uni-directional antagonism of the azoles on olorofim, mediated by azole induced overexpression of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and/or metabolic flux through this pathway. Whilst concerning, the antagonism is only evident when relatively low levels of both drugs are used. It is interesting to note that the TR<sub>34</sub> L98H isolate used in this study has reduced susceptibility to olorofim when compared to the CEA10 isolate and the antagonism drives the MIC above 0.5 mg/L, whether this is of clinical significance remains to be determined. Interestingly, over-expression of any part of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway results in a modest increase in susceptibility of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> to the azoles indicating that some strains that are resistant to olorofim may be more susceptible to the azoles and highlighting that there is complex crosstalk between the ergosterol and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways. If these drugs are to be used in combination in a clinical setting, careful evaluation of respective drug levels at the site of infection to ensure sufficient concentration of drug to avoid antagonism would be sensible. The consequences of using azoles and olorofim in combination for treatment of strains harbouring the TR<sub>34</sub> L98H allele also needs further evaluation.</p><p id="P35">In summary, we have explored the mechanism behind olorofim susceptibility through a systematic analysis of the COFUN transcription factor null library. All the mutants we identified that had altered sensitivity to olorofim have associated defects in nitrogen metabolism. Two of these mutants, Δ<italic>devR</italic> and Δ<italic>acdX</italic>, show dysregulation of genes involved in metabolic pathways immediately upstream of the pyrimidine pathway potentially leading to a differential flux of metabolites into this pathway. Importantly, we have identified two transcription factors, the CBC and AreA, that regulate cross resistance to both the azoles and olorofim. Lastly, we have detected an antagonistic effect between olorofim and the azoles which we can modulate through transcriptionally unlinking the pyrimidine pathway from upstream pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS152203-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d53aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Data 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS152203-supplement-Supplementary_Data_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d53aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS152203-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d53aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS152203-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d53aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank F2G for supplying the antifungal olorofim.
