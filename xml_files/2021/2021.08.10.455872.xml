While multiple vaccine countermeasures have been approved for emergency use, additional treatments are still needed due to sluggish vaccine rollout, vaccine hesitancy, and inefficient vaccine-mediated protection. Immunoadjuvant compounds delivered intranasally can guide non-specific innate immune responses during the critical early stages of viral replication, reducing morbidity and mortality. N-dihydro<bold>g</bold>alacto<bold>c</bold>hitosan (GC) is a novel mucoadhesive immunostimulatory polymer of β-0-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine that is solubilized by the conjugation of galactose glycans with current applications as a cancer immunotherapeutic. We tested GC as a potential countermeasure for COVID-19. GC was well-tolerated and did not produce histopathologic lesions in the mouse lung. GC administered intranasally before and after SARS-CoV-2 exposure diminished morbidity and mortality in humanized ACE2 receptor expressing mice by up to 75% and reduced infectious virus levels in the upper airway. Fluorescent labeling of GC shows that it is confined to the lumen or superficial mucosa of the nasal cavity, without involvement of adjacent or deeper tissues. Our findings demonstrate a new application for soluble immunoadjuvants such as GC for preventing disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 and may be particularly attractive to persons who are needle-averse.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified from a cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] has caused more than 670 million cases and nearly 6.9 million deaths globally as of March 2023[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 typically include fever, non-productive cough, and mild to moderate dyspnea, with severe cases developing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality increase with age and systemic proinflammatory and cardiovascular co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Recovered patients may also exhibit long-duration symptoms including disruption to sensations of taste and smell, and cognitive impairment (colloquially referred to as “brain fog”) resulting from neurological involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Small animals including mice, hamsters, and ferrets, have been fundamental in defining SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing medical countermeasures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 (hACE2) gene from the human cytokeratin 18 (K18) promoter have served as an especially useful model of severe disease due to well characterized genetics and ease of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Intranasal inoculation of K18-hACE2 mice (hereafter termed hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 results in a high viral burden in the lungs, which diminishes past day 7, and elevated viral loads detectible in the brain at day 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P6">SARS-CoV-2, which can be transmitted in small-droplet aerosols from person to person, can take up to 14 days to produce symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Public health countermeasures have evolved as additional treatments and information regarding transmission risks for COVID-19 have become available. In addition to face coverings and physical distancing, multiple vaccine candidates and therapeutic interventions have now received emergency use authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While ‘herd immunity’ through vaccination remains the target, it is estimated that 70-90% of the global population must be immune in order to interrupt transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. This target becomes even more challenging with high levels of vaccine skepticism, slow production, inequitable distribution, and the rise of variants of concern capable of more efficient transmission or vaccine escape. Pre- and post-exposure countermeasures can help fill the vaccine gap by reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in unprotected communities and thus reduce the global burden of the pandemic. The nucleoside analog, remdesivir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], is the only current FDA-approved therapeutic approved for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients and was authorized based on its ability to shorten recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], but it is not ideal for clinical use due to its only moderate clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], as well as its requirement for intravenous administration. Although there are many active trials of therapeutic agents with more than 10 drugs or biological products holding emergency use authorization, including Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) and Molnupiravir (Lagevrio), most are indicated for patients with severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Despite these advances, there are presently no drugs available for high-risk exposure use to protect against SARS-CoV-2. To circumvent this gap, we repurposed an immunostimulant used for cancer immunotherapy and as a vaccine adjuvant with a goal of mitigating COVID-19 disease.</p><p id="P7">The parent compound of GC, chitosan, is a linear biological polysaccharide polymer of β-0-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and is produced from alkaline treatment of the chitin exoskeleton of crustaceans. Chitosan is approved by the FDA for tissue engineering and drug delivery. Chitosan shows broad-acting antiviral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and immunoadjuvant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] including interferon (IFN) induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] that is critical for viral control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], and has been evaluated as an antiviral therapy for respiratory viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Chitosan and various derivatives have been explored as COVID-19 treatments and vaccine adjuvants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Modification of chitosan by covalently attaching galactose sugars to the free amino acids on the polysaccharide backbone produces N-dihydro<bold>g</bold>alacto<bold>c</bold>hitosan (GC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. GC was initially designed to further improve immune-stimulating functionality of the molecular backbone by adding glycan moieties that can bind to C-type lectin receptors on antigen presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] and lead to a downstream immune response while retaining the mucoadhesive properties of the parent molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, GC has improved solubility at physiological pH ranges compared to its parent molecule, and hence is more suitable as an injectable agent. With these modifications, GC has been developed for use in human interventional immuno-oncology to stimulate systemic anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. GC recruits granulocytes at the injection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] and stimulates activation of dendritic cells and macrophages through upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86, and MHCII <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Macrophages also show increased nitric oxide production and phagocytic abilities in response to GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicates enrichment of type I IFN signaling in multiple innate immune cells, including monocytes, M1 macrophages, and neutrophils in tumors following GC administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Our prior work showed that GC mixed with recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigen vaccines delivered intranasally protects mice from lethal disease after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. In that study, when 0.75% GC was delivered intranasally to control mice, CD45<sup>+</sup> and B cell cellularity increased in cervical lymph nodes accompanied by an influx of migrating and resident dendritic cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These data show that GC induces a local immune response that induces lymphocyte migration and activation in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. The upregulation of innate immune responses and recruitment of cellular responses to the NALT, which is the SARS-CoV-2 exposure site, suggests that broad-acting non-toxic immunoadjuvants such as GC that can be intranasally may modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal instillation may generate a robust immune protection in the upper respiratory tract and may be more widely accepted than vaccine injections. Furthermore, non-specific immunoadjuvants such as GC could offer a benefit over more narrowly targeted antivirals by providing protection against a potentially broad range of pathogens, potentially including future agents not yet affecting public health.</p><p id="P8">In the present study, we explored the use of GC for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection applied pre- and post-exposure to lethal dosages of the virus in transgenic hACE2 mice. To simulate the use of solubilized GC as a nasal spray, we applied the compound intranasally twice before exposure and once following exposure of mice to a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Our data demonstrate a strong protective effect of GC in preventing mortality in this lethal model of disease. Fluorescent-labeled GC administered intranasally remained in the nasal cavity. Pre- and post-exposure countermeasures may help fill the vaccine gap by reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and reduce the global burden of the pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>N-dihydrogalactochitosan reduces SARS-CoV-2-associated mortality in hACE2 transgenic mice</title><p id="P9">To determine the antiviral efficacy of N-dihydro<bold>g</bold>alacto<bold>c</bold>hitosan (GC) against SARS-CoV-2, 6-week-old hACE2 [B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J] mice were treated intranasally (i.n.) with 0.75% GC in neutral buffered saline 3 and 1 days prior to virus exposure and then 1 day post exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To ensure that the dose, schedule, and route of GC administration were well tolerated, pilot studies using 14 additional male and female hACE2 mice showed that GC treatment alone does not produce adverse clinical signs or pulmonary lesions. Lung histologic scores in mice administered GC were not significantly different from mice treated with PBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Mice were inoculated i.n. 1 day prior to the final GC treatment with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2, a route and dose intended to produce high lethality in this model. Inocula were back-titrated to verify the administered dose. Tracheal swabs were collected for the first 3 days post inoculation and animals were monitored daily until day 14 for weight loss and health status.</p><p id="P10">Weight remained stable for the first 3 days in all groups. Weight in infected mice that were not GC-treated rapidly declined, starting at day 4 in the 10<sup>4</sup> PFU group, and at day 5 in the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Half of the GC-treated mice administered 10<sup>4</sup> PFU experienced no weight loss throughout the duration of the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>); conversely, their growth outpaced mock-infected counterparts treated with saline alone (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). This effect was not limited to one biological sex and did not correlate with mouse starting weight at the time of study initiation. Additional mice lost weight starting at day 4 but did not reach euthanasia criteria (loss of 20% of initial body weight) and recovered to starting weight by day 10 post-inoculation. Relative to the 10<sup>4</sup> group, mice inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 exhibited delayed or transient weight loss, with 2 mice experiencing no weight loss over the duration of the study. At the higher inoculation dose of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU, GC significantly reduced weight loss versus delivery vehicle treated controls (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). At the lower 10<sup>3</sup> PFU inoculation dose, GC trended toward protection from weight loss, which was confounded by non-uniform disease in delivery vehicle treated controls (<italic>p</italic>=0.11). Mice treated with delivery vehicle and inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU had a median survival time of 7±3.3 and 6.5±0.9 days, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). At the lower inoculation dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU, GC had an efficacy of 37.5% protection from mortality (<italic>p</italic>=0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).

Infectious SARS-CoV-2 levels were assessed longitudinally in mice by swabbing throats from day 1 to 3 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 was detectible in tracheal swabs of infected animals at day 1 post inoculation and most animals had no detectible virus by day 3. Virus levels were elevated in mice inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU versus 10<sup>3</sup> PFU at 1 day post inoculation (<italic>p</italic>=0.05), but differences between inoculation doses were not detected after day 2 (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99). GC significantly reduced virus levels in tracheal swabs at day 1 and day 2 post inoculation with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU (<italic>p</italic>=0.0005 and <italic>p</italic>=0.02, respectively). A similar effect was not observed in mice that received the lower inoculum of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU. All delivery vehicle-treated mice had detectible virus in tracheal swabs following infection, while 29.2% (7/24) of GC-treated mice had no infectious virus isolated between days 1 and 3. Positive virus detection in tracheal swabs was not correlated with lethal disease in mice (<italic>p</italic>=0.62, Fisher’s exact test). Cumulative virus levels in tracheal swabs were calculated as area under the curve for individual animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

By contrast, mice inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, representative 10<sup>3</sup> image shown) exhibited extensive lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with a peribronchiolar and perivascular distribution and scattered multinucleated syncytial cells 7 days post inoculation. Bronchiolitis, bronchiolar epithelial and alveolar septal necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrin, edema, and vascular endothelial inflammation were also occasionally noted. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice treated with GC showed lesser histopathologic lesions in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, representative 10<sup>3</sup> image shown) compared to animals that did not receive GC, and inflammation was focally distributed instead of widespread. To quantify histopathologic changes, lung lesion severity was scored using specific criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The percent of the lung that was affected in mice euthanized at 6, 7, or 14 days post inoculation as assessed by image analysis software did not differ significantly between SARS-CoV-2 infected mice treated with GC versus those who were not GC treated(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Despite this, GC treatment significantly reduced the mean lung histopathology severity score across all euthanasia days (although not when the results at days 6 and 7 or 14 were analyzed separately [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>]) for mice dosed with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2; scores were reduced from 4.6 to 2.5 (ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Mean scores for mice treated with GC and 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 trended towards being lower than for mice who did not receive GC but were not significantly different (p &gt;0.05).

Serum from blood collected at day 14 post inoculation was assessed for neutralizing antibody against the inoculation strain of SARS-CoV-2 by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at the 80% neutralization threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). All mice surviving virus inoculation generated neutralizing antibodies. Mice in the GC group inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU generated neutralizing titers of 1:676 and 1:861 (geometric mean), respectively. In comparison, PBS-administered mice that received an inoculation dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU had a mean neutralizing titer of 1:1448. Neutralizing antibody titers were not different across treatments (p&gt;0.99) or virus dose, although PBS-administered mice inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable for comparison due to uniform lethality. These data confirm that surviving mice were infected and indicate that animals were able to develop adaptive immune responses that could potentially protect against reinfection.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fluorescent labeled N-dihydrogalactochitosan administered intranasally in mice localizes to the mucous of the nasal cavity</title><p id="P16">Finally, we administered fluorescent labeled GC (FITC-GC) i.n. to mice to examine retention kinetics in the nasal concha. Two mice per time point were FITC-GC treated once and then euthanized 2h, 9h, or 2d later, or were treated twice (2X) and harvested 3d later; for these mice, the second treatment was administered 1 day before euthanasia. Negative control mice were not administered FITC-GC. Histopathology was evaluated and quantified using a scoring rubric developed for the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). Fluorescence in the nasal cavity was visualized with microscopy measured by calculating the percent area of the total nasal conchae per slide with a fluorescent signal. Fluorescing aggregates identified within the oral cavity of several treated mice were not included in the measurements, as they were outside the nasal conchae. Negative control mice had no fluorescent foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). For FITC-GC treated mice, fluorescing foci were predominantly within the lumen or loosely adhered to the nasal mucosa, with infrequent fluorescing areas within the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-f</xref>). Although small group sizes preclude statistical assessments, the fluorescent signal of FITC-GC in the nasal cavity of all but 1 FITC-GC treated mouse appeared higher than in negative control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Histologically, fluorescent material was typically associated with inflammatory cells, mucous, and debris. Histology scoring in the nasal concha of these mice showed that while PBS treated mice had low scores, FITC-GC treatment increased scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Treatment of the group of mice euthanized 3d post treatment with 2 administrations of FITC-GC did not increase the percent nasal concha fluorescent or histology scores. All FITC-GC treated mice showed moderate rhinitis characterized by mixed inflammatory mucosal or submucosal infiltration and or nasal cavity exudate composed of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and mild to moderate hemorrhage, fibrin, edema, and sometimes necrotic debris. Together, these data support a process whereby GC administered i.n. in mice remains confined to the superficial mucosa and acts as a mild irritant without eliciting deeper inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Intranasal administration of GC to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 represents a novel application of this potent immunostimulatory compound. In the present study, GC was well-tolerated and prevented lethal disease in up to 75% of treated humanized mice, while all mice not receiving GC but inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 required euthanasia. All surviving animals had neutralizing antibodies detectable at 14 days post inoculation. Similar SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were detected in GC-treated and untreated animals. Mice that received GC treatment also displayed lower levels of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal swabs collected 1 to 2 days post inoculation. Reducing virus levels in the upper airway has gained particular significance as recent vaccine breakthrough cases with variants of concern demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 shedding at similar levels to unvaccinated individuals, which is a key determinant of transmission potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate a reduction in viral burden and virus-induced disease along with a resultant increase in survival due to GC treatment.</p><p id="P18">GC is a polymeric mixture containing strands of varying lengths of selectively galactose-conjugated and partially deacetylated β-0-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine molecules with a specific range of molecular weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Synthesized and purified under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions, N-dihydrogalactochitosan is a well-characterized variant of GC. Characterization and quality control testing ruled out contamination from endotoxins, heavy metals, and other impurities, which eliminates a major confounding factor in the research of these naturally derived molecules, and of chitosan in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Water solubility, immunological properties, biocompatibility, and a favorable toxicity profile are key features of GC. The unconjugated base polymer, chitin, is a primary structural component of cell walls for organisms ranging from fungi to arthropods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Chitosan, a derivative of chitin, is deacetylated through alkaline treatment and is marketed as a nutritional supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and used as a biopolymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Unmodified chitosan has been used successfully to treat influenza A virus infection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], demonstrating a potential application as a non-specific antiviral compound for respiratory virus infection. However, unmodified chitosan has low solubility in neutral buffered aqueous solution and requires acidic formulation; poor characterization, purification and lack of controlled synthetic pathways lead to poor reproducibility and unpredictable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. GC circumvents these limitations through a controlled and reproducible process of synthetically attaching galactose to the free-amino groups of the chitosan base, improving solubility (and thus bioavailability) while maintaining a physiological pH. GC has been previously used as a combination anti-tumor therapy due to its immunoadjuvant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], but its utility as a broad-acting antiviral compound has not previously been investigated.</p><p id="P19">Immunoadjuvants stimulate non-specific innate immune responses through various mechanisms. Some use pattern-recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of antigen detection complexes. While the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 protection has not been determined for GC, chitosan, and similar polymers of N-acetylglucosamine, interact with TLR2, which serves as a rationale for inclusion of chitosan as a vaccine adjuvant. TLR2 signals through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) to stimulate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and downstream inflammatory and anti-microbial cytokine responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. TLR engagement of the canonical NF-κB pathway up-regulates both tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), two potent pro-inflammatory effectors. IL-6, which is necessary for antiviral immunity against other virus families, has been identified as a target of dysregulation associated with hyperinflammatory responses in the lungs during SARS-family coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid protein can stimulate NF-κB activation and IL-6 production independent of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Prolonged high levels of IL-6 are correlated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in humans, and a similar association has been found in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. The timing of IL-6 production may play a critical role in determining whether viral clearance is achieved or alternatively, hyperinflammatory responses result. Early, but not late, induction of IL-6 during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, and rhinovirus infection promote viral clearance and limit prolonged inflammation by establishing regulatory T cell populations that limit virus spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Similarly, timed induction of pro-inflammatory responses by GC treatment pre- and post-infection may promote viral clearance before virus-mediated dysregulation of this pathway can occur. As such, future studies should explore the timing of GC treatment and regulation of IL-6 and associated pro-inflammatory pathways.</p><p id="P20">The data in this study demonstrate that treatment with GC does not impact development of a neutralizing antibody response by day 14 after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, even though it reduced infectious SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal swabs. These data suggest GC functions as an immunoadjuvant that can modulate innate immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to stimulation of robust antiviral adaptive immunity. Experimental evidence from cell culture and animal models supports at least four mechanisms by which complex carbohydrates such as GC could stimulate the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. First, GC recognition by sensors on macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) can stimulate innate immune defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. While immune receptors for GC have not been identified, chitosan binding to C-type lectin receptors such as dectin-1 can initiate innate immune signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Second, GC-mediated antigen uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] and antigen presentation by DCs could lead to CD4 and CD8 T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Studies in mice show GC induces type 1 IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], leading to enhanced DC activation and robust CD4 T helper cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Activation of the STING pathway by type I IFN is a known important antiviral pathway independent of neutralizing antibodies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Notably, DNA sensor activation is mediated by chitosan-induced cellular DNA release. Third, physical antigen sequestration and slow antigen release within draining lymph nodes facilitated by GC could potentially prolong germinal center reactions, thereby enhancing humoral immunity by fostering affinity maturation of B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. Fourth, GC triggers recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the nasal cavity indicating a heightened innate immune response that could eliminate SARS-CoV-2 (and other respiratory pathogens) and infected cells at the entry site via mechanisms such as phagocytosis, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, the release of reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, that recruits more leukocytes. Thus, GC may have potential as a dual-purpose preventative and therapeutic with immunostimulatory properties. Future studies are needed to investigate the impact of GC on SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses.</p><p id="P21">In addition to the immunoadjuvant properties of GC, direct interactions between GC and SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavity may contribute to the protection we observed in mice. As the nasopharyngeal and oral cavity are often the primary entry sites of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, interventions or medications at these locations could provide an important boost in the first line of defense. The reduction in SARS-CoV-2 levels in GC treated mice in the first 2 days post-inoculation suggests that GC has early effects that hamper the initial phase of viral infection, especially given that serum neutralizing antibodies are not detectable before about 7 days. Although we observed that GC reduced tracheal swab titers, we acknowledge that tracheal swabs may less accurately represent virus levels in the upper respiratory tract compared to nasal turbinates. Additionally, GC is viscous, and its cationic charge allows it to bind to negatively charged biomolecules (such as mucin) and act as a mucoadhesive. Our labeling studies with FITC-GC show it remains in the nasal cavity after intranasal administration. GC present at the time of infection may therefore act as a physical barrier and/or directly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 before it can initiate infection. Additional studies of the temporal kinetics of GC bioavailability and detailed studies of GC-virus interactions to establish whether GC blocks virus entry and/or replication are needed to establish mechanisms of protection; these experiments could also clarify why greater protection from lethal disease was observed after inoculation with the higher SARS-CoV-2 dose in these studies.</p><p id="P22">In summary, we show here that GC treatment of humanized mice pre- and post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 reduces lethal disease, virus levels in the upper respiratory tract, and significant lesions in the lungs. These data suggest a possible role of GC as a SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure. Additional pre-clinical studies could focus on the mechanism of protection, including further assessment of the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of GC. Future studies should also determine optimal GC dose and schedule that would confer the greatest benefit in reducing disease, as well as to determine whether GC confers both prophylactic and therapeutic benefits in mice that are euthanized at pre-determined intervals instead of when they meet euthanasia criteria.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="P23">Mouse work was conducted on protocols #21868 (University of California, Davis), # R20-026 (University of Oklahoma) and # AUP007 (Immunophotonics).

reduce disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. We tested the immunoadjuvant N-dihydro<bold>g</bold>alacto<bold>c</bold>hitosan (GC), used previously as an immunostimulant for tumor therapy and adjuvant for viral vaccines, as a potential COVID-19 countermeasure. When GC was administered before and after inoculation of a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 into the nose of humanized mice expressing an entry receptor for the virus, fewer mice showed weight loss and died compared to mice that received only the vehicle but no GC. GC-treated mice also had lower levels of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in their upper airway. These results suggest that GC may be a candidate to prevent or treat COVID-19.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>N-dihydrogalactochitosan protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 mortality.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> <bold>Experimental design</bold> where 6-week-old male and female hACE2 transgenic mice were treated with 0.75% GC or PBS delivery vehicle at days -3, -1 and +1 post-inoculation.
