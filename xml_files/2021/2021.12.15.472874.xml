<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines elicit memory T cell responses. Here, we report the development of two new pools of <underline>E</underline>xperimentally-defined T cell epitopes derived from the non-spike <underline>R</underline>emainder of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (CD4RE and CD8RE). The combination of T cell responses to these new pools and Spike (S) were used to discriminate four groups of subjects with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine status: non-infected, non-vaccinated (I-V-); infected and non-vaccinated (I+V-); infected and then vaccinated (I+V+); and non-infected and vaccinated (I-V+). The overall classification accuracy based on 30 subjects/group was 89.2% in the original cohort and 88.5% in a validation cohort of 96 subjects. The T cell classification scheme was applicable to different mRNA vaccines, and different lengths of time post-infection/post-vaccination. T cell responses from breakthrough infections (infected vaccinees, V+I+) were also effectively segregated from the responses of vaccinated subjects using the same classification tool system. When all five groups where combined, for a total of 239 different subjects, the classification scheme performance was 86.6%. We anticipate that a T cell-based immunodiagnostic scheme able to classify subjects based on their vaccination and natural infection history will be an important tool for longitudinal monitoring of vaccination and aid in establishing SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with cellular and humoral adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Painter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sette and Crotty, 2021</xref>). Correlates of protection from infection and symptomatic disease have not been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Koup et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Krammer, 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">b</xref>), and may require comprehensive assessment of antibody titers and levels of effector and memory B and T cell responses. Broad measurement of T cell responses is hindered by the lack of immunodiagnostics tools with effective predictive power able to discriminate pre-existing immunity, vaccination, and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ogbe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Peeling and Olliaro, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sekine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vandenberg et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">While SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses are detected in nearly all COVID-19 convalescent individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Grifoni et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Le Bert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tarke et al., 2021a</xref>), they are also found in 20-50% of unexposed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sette and Crotty, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tarke et al., 2021a</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates a largely novel repertoire of T cells, with over 80% of the epitopes not recognized in unexposed donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tarke et al., 2021a</xref>). In addition, mRNA or viral vector vaccines boost the spike protein-specific immune responses in both unexposed and convalescent individuals without affecting the responses to non-spike SARS-CoV-2 components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bertoletti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lozano-Ojalvo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mateus et al., 2021</xref>). Further complexity is associated with evaluating responses in subjects previously infected and subsequently vaccinated, and conversely, previously vaccinated and subsequently infected (breakthrough infection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Niessl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rovida et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore a possibility to develop epitope pools based on spike and the rest of the genome reactivity as a tool to discriminate subjects based on their vaccination and natural infection history.</p>
<p id="P4">We have shown that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells can be detected and quantitated using peptide pools in various T cell assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">da Silva Antunes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Grifoni et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tarke et al., 2021b</xref>) which have proven useful to derive information about the kinetics and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in both COVID-19 infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mateus et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequent studies detailed the repertoire of epitope specificities recognized in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tarke et al., 2021a</xref>). More recently, a meta-analysis of experimental curated data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed a large repertoire of over 1400 epitopes defined in 25 different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Grifoni et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we used this information to develop SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide pools optimized for broader epitope repertoire and wider HLA coverage for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Accordingly, two pools of <underline>E</underline>xperimentally defined epitopes derived from the non-spike <underline>R</underline>emainder of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, (CD4RE and CD8RE) were established.</p>
<p id="P5">Several platforms and strategies have been developed to assess T cell responses in both vaccinated or infected individuals, using different read-outs and technologies, such as cytokine release assays (ELISPOT, or ELISA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Krishna, Preprint</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kruse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Martínez-Gallo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Murugesan, Preprint</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tormo, Pre-proof</xref>) or flow cytometry-based assays (Blast transformation, or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lind Enoksson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zelba et al., 2021</xref>). These assays mainly rely on the characterization of responses to the spike or nucleocapsid antigens, and therefore do not address the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and the remarkable breadth of T cell responses against this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Grifoni et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we developed an immunodiagnostic T cell assay using a pool of overlapping peptides spanning the entire spike protein in combination with experimentally defined non-spike pools to classify subjects based on their vaccination and natural infection history. This tool showed a highly predictive power to discriminate responses based on distinctive COVID-19 immune profiles, including breakthrough infections, and clinical applicability demonstrated by using a validation cohort, different vaccine platforms, and assessment of responses at different lengths of time post-infection/post-vaccination.</p>

<title>Cohorts associated with known infection and vaccination history</title>
<p id="P7">239 participants were enrolled in the study and classified into five groups based on known vaccination and clinical history: (50 non-infected, non-vaccinated (I-V-); 50 infected and non-vaccinated (I+V-); 66 infected and then vaccinated (I+V+); 50 non-infected and vaccinated (I-V+); and 23 vaccinated and then infected (V+I+). An overview of the characteristics from all the participants is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. For the I+V-, I+V+ and V+I+ groups, SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by PCR test during the acute phase of infection or verified by serological detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD region at the time of blood donation.</p>
<p id="P8">The study primarily consisted of subjects recruited in San Diego, California (see material and methods for more details). Among individuals with history of COVID-19 disease, the majority were symptomatic mild disease cases, owing to the nature of the study recruitment design. Specifically, 44 donors (88%) for I+V-, 45 donors (90%) for I+V+, and 23 donors (100%) for V+I+ had mild symptoms, 3 donors (6%) of I+V- and I+V+ groups had moderate symptoms, and 3 (6%) and 2 donors (4%) from the I+V- and I+V+ groups, respectively, had severe symptoms. The median days of blood collection post symptom onset (PSO) were 119 (20-308), 354 (57-508) and 32 (18-93) for I+V-, I+V+ and V+I+ groups respectively. For the I-V+, I+V+ and V+I+ groups, the vaccinated subjects received two doses of mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), as verified by vaccination records and positive plasma SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD IgG titers. Similar distribution of Pfizer or Moderna administered vaccines (45%-55%) were present in vaccinated subjects from either the I-V+ or I+V+ group, while in the V+I+ group, 15 (65%) subjects had received the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 8 (35%) the mRNA-1273 vaccine.</p>
<p id="P9">The median days of blood collection post second dose of vaccination (PVD) were 16 (13-190), 32 (7-188) and 163 (55-271) for I-V+, I+V+ and V+I+ groups, respectively. All the I-V- subjects were collected before the attributed pandemic period (2013-2019) and confirmed seronegative with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD IgG titers. In all cohorts, the median ages were relatively young (25 (17-64), 42 (19-67), 40 (21-74), 38 (21-73), 30 (22-68) for I-V-, I+V-, I-V+, I+V+ and V+I+ groups respectively), with the female gender well represented and different ethnicities represented. In our study, participants were further divided in an exploratory cohort (120 donors, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), an independent validation cohort (96 donors, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) and a third cohort of breakthrough infections (V+I+; 23 donors, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Differential SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell responses in unexposed, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects</title>
<p id="P10">To detect SARS-CoV-2 T-cell reactivity, we previously routinely utilized a pool of overlapping peptides spanning the entire spike (S) sequence (253 peptides) and a pool of predicted HLA Class II binders from the Remainder (R) of the genome (CD4R; (221 peptides) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Grifoni et al., 2020b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Here to further optimize detection of non-Spike reactivity, we designed epitope pools based on Experimentally (E) defined epitopes, from the non-spike sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The CD4RE and CD8RE megapools (MP) consisted of 284 and 621 peptides respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). A pool of epitopes derived from an unrelated ubiquitous pathogen (EBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Carrasco Pro et al., 2015</xref>) was used as a specificity control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">T cell reactivity was assessed by the Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">da Silva Antunes et al., 2021</xref>) and data represented as either absolute magnitude or stimulation index (SI). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detected in all convalescent and/or vaccinated individuals and approximately 50% of non-infected, non-vaccinated individuals. Similar results were observed when responses were plotted as SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unexposed subjects were associated with significantly lower reactivity as compared to all the other groups (<italic>p</italic>-values ranging 1.3e-7 to 1.0e-15) and convalescent and vaccinated (I+V+) subjects exhibited higher responses than convalescent (I+V-) subjects (p=0.02 and p=0.04 for absolute magnitude and SI, respectively) or vaccinated (I-V+) subjects (p=0.01 and p=0.02 for absolute magnitude and SI, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Importantly, CD4RE responses were able to differentiate convalescent subjects (I+V- or I+V+) from unexposed and vaccinated (I-V+) subjects with <italic>p</italic>-values ranging 5.6e-8 to 5.7e-12 and vaccinated (I-V+) from infected and vaccinated (I+V+) subjects (p=1.4e-11 and p=1.1e-11 for absolute magnitude and SI, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). No statistically significant difference in EBV reactivity was observed when the four groups were compared, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Differential SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell and IFNγ FluoroSpot responses in unexposed, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects</title>
<p id="P12">SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cell responses were also broadly detected among all the cohorts studied. CD8+ T cell responses were detected in 90-100% of the convalescent and/or vaccinated individuals and approximately in 1/4 of non-infected, non-vaccinated individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar responses were observed when plotted as SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As observed for CD4+ T cell responses, unexposed subjects (I-V-) were discriminated from all the other groups (<italic>p</italic>-values ranging 2.6e-5 to 8.8e-13) and I+V+ infected/vaccinated subjects exhibited higher responses than I+V- convalescent (p=0.03 and p=0.16 for absolute magnitude and SI respectively). Identical results were observed parsing spike-specific responses with CD8RE able to differentiate convalescent (I+V-) from unexposed and vaccinated (I-V+) subjects (<italic>p</italic>-values ranging 0.02 to 5.9e-6) and vaccinated from infected/vaccinated (I+V+) subjects (p=0.04 and p=0.02 for absolute magnitude and SI, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). No statistically significant difference in EBV reactivity was observed when the four groups were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">In parallel, an IFNγ FluoroSpot assay was also employed to evaluate the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses using a threshold of 20 IFNγ spot forming cells (SFC) per million PBMC. Responses were detected in many infected or vaccinated individuals and similar results were observed for Spike, CD4RE or CD8RE when considering both the absolute magnitude or stimulation index, albeit as expected, with lower sensitivity and specificity compared to AIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Improved performance of the CD4RE pool based on experimentally defined epitopes</title>
<p id="P14">Results from both AIM and IFNγ FluoroSpot assay demonstrated that the newly developed CD4RE pool had both improved sensitivity and specificity, compared to the previously used CD4R pool of predicted epitopes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). In more detail, higher positive CD4+ T cell responses in I+V- (28/30 (93%) vs 26/30 (87%), <italic>p</italic> = 2.0e-4) and I+V+ (28/30 (93%) vs 23/30 (77%), <italic>p</italic> = 5.0e-6), and lower non-specific response in I-V- (8/30 (27%) vs 14/30 (47%), <italic>p</italic> = 0.037) and I-V+ (2/30 (7%) vs 4/30 (13%), <italic>p</italic> = 0.031) were detected using CD4RE when compared to CD4R in the AIM assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Similar results were shown by IFNγ FluoroSpot, assay albeit with lower sensitivity compared to AIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). These results demonstrate that the use of experimentally defined, as opposed to predicted epitopes provides higher signal in SARS-CoV-2 exposed subjects, while lowering responses from non-exposed subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Classification of subjects with different exposure history based on Spike and CD4RE reactivity</title>
<p id="P15">We reasoned that unexposed (I-V-) subjects would be unreactive to experimentally defined SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, while uninfected vaccinated (I-V+) subjects should react only to the S pool. We further reasoned that infected (I+V-) subjects should recognize both S and CD4RE, but infected and vaccinated (I+V+) subjects would have a higher relative S reactivity than infected only (I+V-), as is often the case with hybrid immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Crotty, 2021</xref>), due to exposure to S twice, once during infection and the other during vaccination.</p>
<p id="P16">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, spike- and CD4RE-specific CD4+ T cell responses derived from the AIM assay were arranged in a two-dimensional plot. Each dot represents a single subject from a total of 120 donors (30 for each of the 4 groups, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Optimal cutoffs were established to discriminate the four groups and the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each individual group.</p>
<p id="P17">Subjects with spike responses lower than 0.025% were classified predictively as unexposed (I-V-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). 29 out of 29 subjects with responses matching this criterion were correctly classified (100% of PPV), while nearly all the actual I-V- subjects (29 out of 30) were found to be associated with responses below the threshold, corresponding to a sensitivity of 96.7 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>grey circles</bold>). Subjects with spike responses greater than 0.025% and CD4RE responses lower than 0.015% were classified predictively as I-V+.

<title>Validation of the classifier in an independent cohort</title>
<p id="P19">To confirm the accuracy of this classification scheme, we assessed CD4+ T cell responses in an independent validation cohort of 96 donors (20 for I-V-, I+V-, I+V+, and 36 for I-V+; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, using the same cutoffs as described above for spike and CD4RE responses, similar PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity to the experimental cohort was observed across all the groups with an overall classification accuracy of 88.5%. To further validate the robustness of this classification scheme, the same data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) was plotted as a function of the stimulation index (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).

<title>The classification scheme is applicable to different vaccine platforms, and different lengths of time post-infection/post-vaccination</title>
<p id="P21">To gain further insights on the applicability of the classification scheme, we sought to further test and validate this tool when considering different types of vaccines, and longer timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) or post-vaccination. First, we looked at the response classification as a function of whether vaccinated subjects received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> the overall classification accuracy when using the different mRNA vaccines was of 89.7%. Specifically, both vaccines showed similar magnitude for both total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the I-V+ or I+V+ groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). The accuracy of the classification scheme for the different types of vaccines in the combined I-V+ or I+V+ groups was almost identical (88.5% and 90.9% for the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">Next, we looked at the response classification as a function of the length of time PSO. The overall classification accuracy was of 84.0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). No differences were observed in the magnitude of both total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses between early (≤180 days) and late (&gt;180 days) timepoints from PSO in either the I+V- or the I+V+ groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>). The accuracy of the classification scheme when considering the different PSO timepoints was 82.0% and 81.8% in the I+V- group and 90.0% and 85.0% in the I+V+ group for the early and late timepoints, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Lastly, we looked at the responses as a function of the length of time from the 2<sup>nd</sup> dose of vaccination. The overall classification accuracy was of 89.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). No differences were observed in the magnitude of both total CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses between early (≤30 days) or late (&gt;30 days) timepoints from the last dose of vaccination in either the I-V+ or the I+V+ groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">F</xref>). The accuracy of the classification scheme when considering the different vaccine timepoints was 93.5% and 90.0% in the I-V+ group and 86.4% and 85.7% in the I+V+ group for the early and late timepoints respectively. The classification scheme using CD4+ T cell AIM assay is a robust tool applicable to different types of vaccines, and can accurately classify subjects regardless of the days post-infection/post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>CD4+ T cell reactivity of subjects associated with breakthrough infections</title>
<p id="P24">Breakthrough infections are defined as cases of previously COVID-19 vaccinated individuals associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bergwerk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kustin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mizrahi et al., 2021</xref>). Studies of antibody or T cell responses associated with breakthrough infection are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rovida et al., 2021</xref>). Breakthrough infection might be associated with increased immune responses as a result of the re-exposure (hybrid immunity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Collier et al., 2021</xref>). In other cases, subjects experiencing breakthrough infections might be associated with general weaker immune responsiveness or decrease of vaccine effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Klompas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mizrahi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">Here, we assessed spike and CD4RE T cell responses in a group (n=23) of breakthrough infected individuals (V+I+). Responses were compared to the vaccinated (I-V+), infected (I+V-) or infected and then vaccinated (I+V+) groups matching the V+I+ intervals of vaccination and infection (55-271 and 18-93 days, respectively). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, CD4+ T cell responses from V+I+ subjects were associated with significant higher levels compared to I+V- (p=0.04) and I-V+ (p=2.3e-3) subjects and similar magnitude as the I+V+ subjects. CD8+ T cell responses had comparable levels across all the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar to CD4+ T cell responses, spike RBD IgG titers from V+I+ subjects were equivalent to I+V+ subjects and significantly higher than I+V- (p=4.2e-7) and I-V+ (p=4.0e-15) subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, at the population level breakthrough infections are associated with CD4+ T cell and spike IgG responses that resemble hybrid immunity.</p>

<sec id="S11">
<title>The classification scheme captures heterogeneity in breakthrough infections</title>
<p id="P26">At the level of the classification scheme, infections were effectively segregated from non-infected groups (unexposed and vaccinated). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We further expected that the V+I+ breakthrough infections would be classified in the same manner of I+V+ hybrid immunity samples. Approximately two thirds (15/23 subjects) were identified by the same thresholds associated with responses from the I+V+ group (“High responders”), while the remaining third were classified similarly to I+V- subjects (“Low responders”). No obvious difference in terms of age, PSO, PVD, disease severity or length of infection from vaccination was detected between these donors and the high responders sub-group of 15 donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">In summary, while T cell responses following breakthrough infections (V+I+) are effectively segregated from the responses of uninfected donors (vaccinated or not) and follow the same pattern of responses of individuals vaccinated following natural infection (I+V+) in the majority of the cases, the classification scheme revealed heterogeneity in the CD4+ T cell responses of breakthrough donors.</p>

<title>Validation of the classification scheme with whole study cohort</title>
<p id="P28">Finally, we summarized the overall accuracy of the classification scheme in the five cohorts used in this study including breakthrough infections. For this purpose, we clustered individuals that have been infected and vaccinated, irrespectively of the event that occurred first, into a single group, i.e. I+V/V+I+. When the 239 subjects with distinct COVID-19 status of infection and/or vaccination were combined, the classification scheme achieved a high overall accuracy, either as function of absolute magnitude (86.6%) or SI (82.4%). Also, high specificity and NPV were retained for each individual group with a range of 92.2-98.4% and 88.6-98.4% respectively. These results illustrate the highly predictive power of this classification scheme and its broad clinical applicability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P29">There is a need to understand roles of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses as potential correlates of disease outcome, and/or correlates of vaccine protection from infection or severe disease. Herein, we present the results of T cell quantitation based on the determination of relative activity directed against spike and the rest of the genome, by the use of optimized pools of experimentally defined epitopes (CD4RE and CD8RE). We report successful classification of subjects with different COVID-19 vaccination or natural infection history in the 85-90% range of accuracy. We further show that the strategy is applicable to characterizing immune responses in a group of infected vaccinees (i.e. breakthrough infections).</p>
<p id="P30">Although previous reports studied responses to SARS-CoV-2 in either unexposed, COVID-19 infected or vaccinated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">da Silva Antunes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Grifoni et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Le Bert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mateus et al., 2021</xref>), this is the first demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, that a simple assay strategy can classify T-cell responses measured simultaneously in five different groups of known COVID-19 status of infection, and/or vaccination. The improved sensitivity and specificity resulted from the concept of considering the relative magnitude of responses against the spike and “rest of the genome” components, which overcomes issues related to the fact that magnitude of responses may wane over time, and also by the inclusion of experimentally defined epitopes, which we show are associated with improved signal and selectivity as compared to previously utilized predicted epitopes.</p>
<p id="P31">We demonstrate that the combined use of overlapping spike and CD4RE pools can be used to classify individuals with known clinical status of COVID-19, with high accuracy and sensitivity. This is of importance, as current COVID-19 diagnostic practices rely heavily on subjectively reported history, clinical records and lab modalities with imperfect performance, leading to limited reliability. For example, in longitudinal vaccination studies it will be important to monitor whether subjects enrolled in the studies might have been associated with asymptomatic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kustin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mizrahi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pouwels et al., 2021</xref>), or even associated with abortive seronegative infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Swadling et al., 2021</xref>). Our study supports the notion that discrimination of prior or current infections in vaccinated subjects should not rely exclusively on the analysis of spike-specific responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lind Enoksson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Martínez-Gallo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Murugesan, Preprint</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Murugesan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tormo, Pre-proof</xref>). Indeed, compared to these studies and other studies performing T cell assays using additional SARS-CoV-2 antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Krishna, Preprint</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kruse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zelba et al., 2021</xref>), the use of our new developed pools allowed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 responses with increased sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p id="P32">We also show that similar results were observed when relative versus absolute determinations were employed to measure T cell responses (i.e. using stimulation index or absolute magnitude), which allows for a more generalized use of the classification tool in different flow-cytometer platforms. The robustness of the T cell-based classification scheme was further demonstrated in an independent cohort exhibiting identical performances and was applicable to different types of mRNA vaccines, even when considering extended periods of time elapsed from infection and/or vaccination. The strength of the approach is further demonstrated by the fact that is also applicable to data generated by FluoroSpot cytokine assays despite the lower intrinsic sensitivity of this assay. We anticipate that this assay strategy will be broadly applicable to other readouts, such as ICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mateus et al., 2021</xref>), and whole blood in an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Murugesan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Petrone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). Although these findings were validated in several different cohorts, external validation in even larger and ethnically diverse populations and additional readouts are of interest. Potential future developments might also include epitope pools encompassing mutated epitopes from commonly circulating variants and pools with improved resolution to measure CD8+ T cell responses.</p>
<p id="P33">T cell responses from breakthrough infections were also evaluated. High levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity was observed. The elevated T cell responsiveness was paralleled by high levels of spike RBD IgG. Interestingly, these responses were of similar magnitude as responses from a group of individuals infected and then vaccinated (I+V+ in our study), whose features are commonly associated with hybrid immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Crotty, 2021</xref>). Notably, breakthrough infections were also associated with higher CD4+ T cell and spike RBD IgG responses compared to infected only or vaccinated only subjects. These results suggest that T and B cell reactivity associated with breakthrough infections is increased as a result of re-exposure. However, the classification tool system, also revealed significant heterogeneity in responses in some subjects, possibly linking breakthrough infections to lower adaptive responses.</p>

<title>Design and production of new SARS-CoV-2 epitope pools</title>
<p id="P36">To study T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, we used a megapool (MP) of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 spanning the entire spike protein sequence (253 peptides; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Grifoni et al., 2020b</xref>).

Briefly, for each individual group the following calculations were performed: 1) positive predictive value (PPV)= (True Positives)/(True Positives+False Positives); 2) negative predictive value (NPV)= (True Negatives)/(True Negatives+False Negatives); 3) sensitivity =(True Positives)/(True Positives+False Negatives); and 4) specificity=(True Negatives)/(True Negatives+False Positives).</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were measured as percentage of AIM+ (OX40+CD137+) CD4+ T cells or AIM+ (CD69+CD137+) CD8+ T cells after stimulation of PBMCs with peptides pools encompassing spike only (Spike) MP or the experimentally defined CD4RE and CD8RE MPs representing all the proteome without spike. EVB MP was used as a control. Graphs show individual response of spike, CD4RE or CD8RE and the combination of both (Total CD4+ or Total CD8+) plotted as background subtracted (<bold>A, C</bold>) or as SI (<bold>B, D</bold>) against DMSO negative control. Geometric mean for the 4 different groups is shown. Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons was performed and <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.
