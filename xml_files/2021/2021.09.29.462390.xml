One of the earliest examples of bioactive volatiles emitted by bacteria is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which was long considered a mere respiratory toxin conferring competitive advantage to cyanogenic strains. Using cyanide-deficient mutants in two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains and global transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that the impact of HCN is much more global than previously thought. We first observed that the lack of cyanogenesis in emitting strains led to massive transcriptome reprogramming affecting diverse traits such as motility and biofilm formation (respectively inhibited vs. promoted by HCN), or the production of siderophores, phenazines and other antimicrobial compounds (repressed by HCN). We then exposed non-cyanogenic strains to biogenically emitted HCN from neighboring cells and observed similar transcriptome modulations and phenotypic changes, suggesting that HCN not only acts endogenously but also exogenously, remotely manipulating important traits involved in competition and virulence, e.g. siderophore production, in other organisms. Cyanogenesis in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> has long been known to play a role in both the virulence of opportunistic pathogens and the efficient biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial strains, however this impact was so far thought to occur solely through the inhibition of respiration. We demonstrate here new ecological roles for a small and fast-diffusing volatile compound, which opens novel avenues in our understanding of and ability to interfere with important processes taking place in pathogenic and beneficial <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The exchange of volatile compounds as means of communication between bacteria and other organisms has recently gained increasing interest over the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). One of the first volatiles discovered to play a role in biotic interactions is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a well-known toxin irreversibly binding to the key respiratory enzyme cytochrome C oxidase. Cyanogenesis occurs in many different types of organisms, including bacteria, plants, animals and even humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In bacteria, cyanogenesis occurs in different but restricted taxa such as <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (e.g. <italic>Chromobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium</italic>) or cyanobacteria (e.g. <italic>Anacystis, Nostoc</italic>), although most studies have focused on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains, which form hydrogen cyanide (HCN) by oxidative decarboxylation of glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Cyanogenic strains have evolved a range of mechanisms which enable them to avoid the toxic effects of their own product, for instance the enzymatic conversion of HCN to the less harmful thiocyanate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), or the reliance on alternative cyanide-insensitive cytochrome c oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). HCN is considered an important secondary metabolite in both environmental (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> CHA0) and clinical (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In the clinical context, HCN emission has been shown to occur in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients harbouring <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains and to significantly affect lung function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In addition to this direct effect on the host, cyanogenesis was recently shown to confer a competitive advantage to lung-infecting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> via the inhibition of co-infecting <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, a frequent co-inhabitant of cystic fibrosis patient lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In the environmental context too, the ecological role of HCN emission in bacterial defense against competing organisms is well established and this molecule has been repeatedly pinpointed as a major actor in the arsenal of root-associated <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> with protective effects against plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In an earlier study using comparative genomics to identify the molecular determinants of late blight disease control by potato-associated <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, HCN came out as a likely candidate accounting for the inhibition of the devastating oomycete pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, when comparing the anti-<italic>Phytophthora</italic> effects of cyanogenesis-deficient mutants in two different species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> with that of their respective wild types, only little to no reduction in their antagonistic potential was observed. On the contrary, the mutants seemed to have even gained additional antimicrobial capacities, since they induced higher inhibition of the pathogen’s zoospore germination compared with the wild types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This observation raised the question wether HCN, in addition to acting on neighboring organisms, was also influencing the physiology of the emitting bacteria themselves, as previously shown for other so-called “secondary metabolites” (e.g. 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) or phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>)) initially discovered for their impact on target organisms but later demonstrated to fulfill important physiological functions in the producing bacteria. In order to answer this question, we took advantage of previously generated HCN-deficient mutants in two different strains of plant-associated <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and first compared their transcriptome to that of their repective wild types. We then investigated whether the changes observed were restricted to endogenous effects on the emitting bacteria themselves, or whether they would also be triggered remotely in neighboring bacteria exposed to biogenically produced HCN.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="P4">In a former study quantifying the impact of HCN emission on the biocontrol activity of potato-associated <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains against <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> zoospore germination, we made the unexpected observation that the HCN-deficient mutants displayed stronger inhibitory activities compared with their respective wild types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). As iron deprivation mediated by the excretion of chelating agents is a well-known mechanism of antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), we started the present work by quantifying the mutants’ production of siderophores. We first grew both strains on King’s B medium, which is classically used to detect siderophores in pseudomonads. In contrast to the negative control <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, our two model strains <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> R47 and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> R32 secreted siderophores as evidenced by the halo surrounding the colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). In <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> R32, the cyanide-deficient mutant indeed appeared to produce more siderophores than the wild type, while the difference was less clear for R47 in this qualitative plate assay. Since we knew from these two strains’ genomes that they both encode pyoverdine production, we used a fluorospectrometry-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) to quantify the production dynamics of this particular siderophore as well as the growth of both wild types and mutants in liquid King’s B medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The production of pyoverdine was significantly higher in both cyanide-deficient mutants compared with the corresponding wild type strains. For R47, faster growth was observed for the mutant at the onset of the stationary phase, yet the strong increase in pyoverdine production was in no proportion to this moderate growth advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). For R32, the decreased growth of the wild type compared with the mutant was less striking. This differential impact of cyanogenesis on growth in the two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains might be linked to their respective HCN production levels, which were higher (ca. 80 μM) for R47 than for R32 (ca. 28 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The orange color of R47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) originates from the production of phenazines, an important class of antimicrobial compounds, also involved in iron acquisition, redox balance, and many other biological functions in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We therefore also quantified the production of phenazine carboxylic acid (PCA), one particular form of phenazines, in both wild type and cyanide-deficient mutant strains grown in King’s B medium. We analyzed this phenotype only in <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic> R47, since phenazine biosynthetic genes are absent from the genome of <italic>P. putida</italic> R32. We observed that similarly to pyoverdine, PCA was also produced at a higher concentration (&gt;2.5-fold) by the mutant than by the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Next to PCA, other phenazines were also produced more abundantly in the cyanide-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the absence of HCN led to a significantly enhanced production of other secondary metabolites that could fulfil similar ecological functions, such as the inhibition of microbial competitors.</p><p id="P5">The ability to move towards a favorable environment and once there, to form a biofilm are relevant features for successful colonization of both plant (e.g. root) and human (e.g. lung) tissues by pseudomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We therefore wondered whether motility and biofilm formation would also be influenced by the loss of cyanogenesis in the two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> mutants. Swimming motility assays revealed that both cyanide-deficient mutants were significantly more motile (ca. 2-fold) than the wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). In contrast to all previous phenotypes tested, where the mutants performed better than the wild types, biofilm formation was significantly lower for both mutants compared to the wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). In addition to confirming the expected negative relation between a motile and a sessile life style, these data provided the proof of concept that HCN could also stimulate and not only inhibit physiological processes in cyanogenic pseudomonads, suggesting that its effects may go beyond those of a mere toxin. Overall, the consistent observation in two different <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species that the loss of cyanogenesis led to effects as diverse as enhanced siderophore production and reduced biofilm formation, confirmed our hypothesis that HCN likely has a global impact on bacterial physiology and behavior.</p><p id="P6">In order to test this hypothesis, we selected <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic> R47 because of its large genome encoding many secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and compared the transcriptome of the wild type and that of the cyanide-deficient mutant grown in liquid King’s B medium at three different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We chose these time points to cover i) the early log phase, at which we did not expect any change since HCN, as a secondary metabolite, was classically reported to be produced at the end of the exponential growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), ii) the transition between exponential and stationary growth phase, at which HCN effects were expected to start taking place but no difference in growth was yet observed between the wild type and the mutant, and iii) the later stationary growth phase, at which we expected changes to be further amplified but where they would likely be confounded with different growth dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, the transcriptomes of the wild type and the cyanide-deficient mutant clustered separately already at the early log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Looking at the expression of the HCN biosynthetic operon in <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic> R47 wild type, we observed that it was indeed expressed at the early exponential phase already (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), and its absence induced the dysregulation of 32 genes belonging to different COG categories at this early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Among these, genes involved in signal transduction and lipid transport / metabolism were mainly upregulated in the absence of HCN, while genes involved in transcription, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, inorganic ion transport and secondary metabolism were mainly downregulated. Genes belonging to the energy production and conversion category were also dysregulated, with some being up- and others downregulated in the mutant, such as the genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase orphan subunits. The early expression of alternative oxidases in the wild type compared with the mutant constitutes a further proof that cyanogenesis occurs earlier than classically assumed and is not solely conditioned by the lack of nutrients or of oxygen occurring at the early stationary phase, where HCN production has been previously reported as being maximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As expected, differences between the transcriptomes of the wild type and the mutant increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref>), with 206 genes (ca. 3.2 % of the genome) dysregulated at the transition between the exponential and stationary growth phases, and 350 (ca. 5.5 %) at the late stationary growth phase, where all COG categories were affected by the presence vs. absence of HCN. These genome-wide expression changes already started at the second time point (transition to stationary growth phase), where both strains still followed the same growth dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), which suggests that the wild type was not or only marginally affected by HCN toxicity at this growth stage but still showed genome-wide transcription changes compared with the cyanide-deficient mutant. Overall, the absence of HCN in the mutant led to upregulation of many genes, as for instance those involved in pyoverdine and phenazine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), which corroborated our phenotypic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Among the few genes upregulated by HCN, one was predicted to encode the helix-turn-helix-type transcriptional regulator MlrA which was strongly downregulated in the cyanide-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. enterica</italic>, MlrA was shown to activate extracellular matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This could explain the higher biofilm forming capacity observed in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> wild types compared to the cyanide-deficient mutants in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Higher biofilm formation by wild types could also be explained by higher expression of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). This system has been shown to be involved in biofilm formation by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Next to its putative role in biofilm formation, the T6SS has been involved in bacterial interactions with competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), similarly to HCN itself. Likewise, the operon encoding the insecticidal Fit toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) was also upregulated in the absence of HCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), suggesting a possible compensation of the lack of one biological weapon with the higher production of others (e.g. phenazines, pyoverdine, Fit toxin and T6SS). Regarding motility, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of flagellar biosynthesis genes in the cyanide-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), which could explain both the mutant’s higher motility and lower biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Altogether, the global transcriptome shifts caused by the presence vs. absence of HCN corroborated the phenotypic differences observed between the wild type and the cyanide-deficient mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and highlighted endogenous HCN as a global regulator of gene expression, compared e.g. with the global activator of secondary metabolism (GacA), whose mutation led to ca 13 % of dysregulated genes in the closely related strain <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic> 30-84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). However, the extent of the observed HCN-induced transcriptome changes is in stark contrast to earlier work on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which reported only 16 dysregulated genes in an cyanide-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This discrepancy might be due to a higher resolution of RNA-Seq over microarray analysis, or to different culture conditions, with the complex but iron-limited King’s B medium in our case and glycine-enriched minimal medium boosting HCN emission in the earlier study. Interestingly, many of the phenotypes we observed in the mutants can be linked to iron availability: siderophore and phenazine production are evident examples, but also motility and biofilm formation have been linked to iron availability in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). While iron was shown to inhibit motility and to increase biofilm formation in this bacterium, we observed a similar effect of HCN itself in our experiments (with decreased motility and increased biofilm in the wild type), although HCN is rather expected to bind iron and therefore to reduce its availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The higher emission of siderophores in the HCN mutant is also consistent with the hypothesis that endogenously produced HCN would not act by scavenging iron, which would result in the wild type needing higher siderophore production than the cyanide-deficient mutant. This does not rule out an interaction between iron and HCN, especially since iron itself was shown to increase HCN emission in different cyanogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This direct effect of iron on cyanogenesis makes it difficult to disentangle iron- and HCN-mediated effects, as growing the strains under different iron regimes would lead to differential HCN emission.</p><p id="P8">Since HCN is a gaseous molecule easily diffusing into the vicinity of cyanogenic strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), we wondered whether neighboring, non-cyanogenic cells would respond to exogenous HCN supply with similar changes in physiology as those we observed between mutants and wild types. We therefore carried out an experiment where the cyanide-deficient mutants of R47 and R32 were grown in volatile-mediated contact with their respective wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), and compared the phenotypes of the wild types, the mutants and the HCN-exposed mutants. To exclude a volatile-mediated effect that would not be caused by HCN itself but by other volatile compounds exhibiting altered emission in the mutant compared with the wild type, we first verified that the volatile profiles of both strains exhibited no other significant difference except for the presence vs. absence of HCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Exposing the mutants of both R47 and R32 to exogenous HCN emitted by their respective wild types did not impair the mutants’ growth (as would be expected if HCN would be toxic at these concentrations), yet it suppressed the increase in pyoverdine production observed in the non-exposed mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>) and restored both mutants’ biofilm formation and swimming motility to the wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). For the motility rescue experiment, in the R32 cyanide-deficient mutant, we observed swarming rather than swimming motility in the chosen split plate setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). We then also compared the transcriptomes of exposed and non-exposed mutants of R47 with that of the wild type to see whether the phenotypes induced by exogenous exposure to biologically produced HCN would be corroborated by changes at the gene expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). At the early exponential phase, both non-exposed and exposed mutants of R47 showed similar transcriptomes (only four differentially expressed genes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that at this early time point, HCN was affecting only the producing cells but was not yet reaching relevant concentrations in the neighboring wells. However, at the later time point corresponding to the transition between the exponential and stationary growth phases, most of the gene expression changes observed in the mutant were rescued by exposure to exogenous HCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6b,c</xref>). These included the changes in genes encoding pyoverdine and phenazine synthesis, the insecticidal Fit toxin, as well as the MlrA activator, the T6SS and the flagellar biosynthetic genes potentially involved in biofilm formation, which corroborated the rescued phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). The transcriptome changes observed at this intermediate time point between the mutant and the exposed mutant mimicked those observed between the mutant and the wild type, confirming that the exposed mutant behaved largely like a wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,e</xref>). Principal component analysis showed that this transcriptome similarity was further increased at the late stationary phase (time point 3), although the number of dysregulated genes increased from 19 to 141, which might be due to the differential growth between the wild type and the exposed mutant observed at this later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6a,b</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of genes rescued by external supply of HCN at the transition between the exponential and stationary growth phases differed between the COG categories, with a lower rescue proportion in the categories involved in housekeeping functions and primary metabolism (e.g. ribosome structure, replication, energy production, or carbohydrate, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism) than in those potentially involved in biotic interactions (e.g. defense mechanisms, inorganic ion transport and secondary metabolism) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Altogether, our data indicate that the biological functions of HCN are much wider than previously thought. Similarly to phenazines, which were also first categorized as “mere secondary metabolites” and later turned out to act as internal signaling molecules with diverse and important cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), we provide evidence here that HCN is much more than a respiratory toxin, and acts as an inter- and extracellular signal on both producing and receiving cells. These findings are in line with recent reports on the ability of HCN to induce broad physiological effects in both plant and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Compared with phenazines, HCN is a volatile molecule and as such, its zone of influence is expected to be much broader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Our data show that this small volatile compound remotely leads to global changes in the behavior of neighboring bacteria, repressing their iron uptake, swimming motility and synthesis of biological weapons such as phenazines, the insecticidal Fit toxin or the type VI secretion system, which likely confers a substantial advantage to cyanogenic bacteria over non-cyanogenic ones in the highly competitive environments they usually colonize, from the plant rhizosphere to the human lung.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S4"><title>Strains and culture media</title><p id="P10"><italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> (R47) and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> (R32) and their derived ∆hcn mutants were grown at 30 °C on lysogeny broth (LB) agar medium (20 g/L of LB mix (Lennox, Fisher Bioreagents) with 15 g/L of agar (Agar-agar, Kobe I, Carl Roth)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).

The samples (40 l) were injected onto a MN Nucleosil C18 analytical column (250 mm x 4 mm i.d., 100-5) (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany), using a flow rate of 0.8 mL.min<sup>-1</sup> at 27 °C. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) in water) and solvent B (0.1 % TFA in acetonitrile); the gradient started with 5 % of solvent B and reached 15 % at 2 min, 83 % at 15 min, 95 % at 16 min, and 100 % at 45 min. Phenazines were detected at 365 and 250 nm with diode array on-line detection. UV spectra were recorded between 200 and 800 nm. For compound identification, samples were freeze dried, dissolved in 500 l of ethyl acetate and purified by preparative TLC on silica gel (Kieselgel 60, F<sub>254</sub>, 0.25, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using CHCl<sub>3</sub>:MeOH (95:5) as the eluent. The spots were visualized by exposure to UV radiation at 256 nm. Three compounds were isolated and identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry as 1 or 2- hydroxyphenazine (i) (Rf 0.72; RT 14.5; m/z 197.07 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>), phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) (ii) (Rf 0.64; RT 16.4; m/z 225.06 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>) and 2-hydroxyphenazine carboxylic acid (iii) (Rf 0.58; RT 21.6; m/z 241.06 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>). ESI-MS/MS analysis in positive ionization mode was performed on Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectra were recorded between 50 and 500 <italic>m/z</italic>. The peak areas at the specific wavelength λ<sub>max</sub> 250 nm were chosen for qualitative quantification. Three biologically independent replicates were collected with three technical replicates in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Swimming motility assays</title><p id="P13">Swimming motility assays were performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>Bacteria communicate by exchanging chemical signals, some of which are volatile and can remotely reach other organisms. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was one of the first volatiles discovered to severely impact exposed organisms by inhibiting their respiration. Using HCN-deficient mutants in two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains, we demonstrate that HCN’s impact goes beyond the sole inhibition of respiration and affects both emitting and receiving bacteria in a global way, modulating their motility, biofilm formation and production of antimicrobial compounds. Our data suggest that bacteria could use HCN not only to control their own cellular functions, but also to remotely influence the behavior of other bacteria sharing the same environment. Since HCN emission occurs in both clinically and environmentally relevant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, these findings are important to better understand or even modulate the expression of bacterial traits involved in both virulence of opportunistic pathogens and in biocontrol efficacy of plant-beneficial strains.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Loss of cyanogenesis increases pyoverdine and phenazine production, induces swimming motility and represses biofilm production.</title><p>a, Qualitative analysis of siderophore production by wild type (wt) and cyanide-deficient (∆hcn) mutant strains of both <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> R47 and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> R32 after five days of growth at room temperature on King’s B agar medium.
