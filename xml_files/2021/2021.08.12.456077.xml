<abstract>
<p id="P1">To understand the nature of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we analyzed at single cell level the B cell responses of five naïve and five convalescent people immunized with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Convalescents had higher frequency of spike protein specific memory B cells and by cell sorting delivered 3,532 B cells, compared with 2,352 from naïve people. Of these, 944 from naïve and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naïve people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naïve people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern. Our data suggest that people that are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Twenty months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 200 million people infected, 4.2 million deaths, and 3.9 billion vaccines doses administered, the world is still struggling to control the virus. In most developed countries vaccines have vastly reduced severe diseases, hospitalization and deaths, but they have not been able to control the infections which are fueled by new and more infectious variants. A large number of studies so far have shown that protection from infection is linked to the production of neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein (S protein) of the virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. This is a metastable, trimeric class 1 fusion glycoprotein, composed by the S1 and S2 subunits, and mediates virus entry changing from a prefusion to postfusion conformation after binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and heparan sulfates on the host cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Potent neutralizing antibodies recognize the S1 subunit of each monomer which includes the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) immunodominant sites<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. The large majority of neutralizing antibodies bind the receptor binding motif (RBM), within the RBD, and a smaller fraction target the NTD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Neutralizing antibodies against the S2 subunit have been described, however they have very low potency<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Neutralizing antibodies generated after infection derive in large part from germline IGHV3-53 and the closely related IGHV3-66 with very few somatic mutations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Starting from the summer of 2020, the virus started to generate mutations that allowed the virus to evade neutralizing antibodies, to become more infectious, or both. Some of the mutant viruses completely replaced the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2. The most successful variant viruses are the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.1.248 (gamma) and B.1.617.2 (delta) which have been named Variants of Concern (VoCs) by the World Health Organization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The delta variant is presently spreading across the globe and causing big concern also in fully vaccinated populations. It is therefore imperative to understand the molecular dynamics of the immune response to vaccination in order to design better vaccines and vaccination policies. Several investigators have shown that vaccination of convalescent people can yield neutralizing antibodies which can be up to a thousand-fold higher than those induced by infection or vaccination, suggesting that one way of controlling the pandemic may be the induction of a hybrid immunity-like response using a third booster dose<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Here we compared at single cell level the nature of the neutralizing antibody response against the original Wuhan virus and the VoCs in naïve and convalescent subjects immunized with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Naïve subjects were seronegative before vaccination while convalescent donors were already seropositive before vaccination. They will be named seronegatives and seropositives respectively in this work. Our data suggest that immunization of people already seropositive to the virus, increases the frequency, potency and breadth of neutralizing antibodies and may help to control emerging variants.</p>

<title>High levels of S protein specific memory B cells and plasma activity in seropositive vaccinees</title>
<p id="P3">In this study we enrolled 10 donors vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, 5 of them were healthy people naïve to SARS-CoV-2 infection at vaccination (seronegative) and other 5 had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (seropositive). Subject details are summarized in <bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>
</bold>. We initially analyzed the B cell population frequencies between our groups. Seropositives showed a 2.46-fold increase in S protein specific CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>- +</sup> MBCs compared to seronegatives and an overall 10% higher level of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup> MBCs (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>
</bold>). On the other hand, seronegatives showed a 2.3-fold higher frequency of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> IgM<sup>+</sup> MBCs compared to seropositives. No differences were found in the levels of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> IgM<sup>+</sup> S protein<sup>+</sup> MBCs between the two groups assessed in this study (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>
</bold>). Following the MBC analyses, we characterized the polyclonal response of these donors by testing their binding response to the S protein trimer, RBD, NTD and S2-domain, and subsequently by testing their neutralization activity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>
</bold>). Plasma from seropositives showed a higher binding activity to the S protein and all tested domains compared to seronegatives (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A - D</xref>
</bold>). In addition, seropositives showed a 10-fold higher neutralization activity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to seronegatives (<bold>

<title>Frequency of neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan virus and variants of concern</title>
<p id="P4">To better characterize the B cell immune response in seronegative and seropositive donors, we single cell sorted antigen-specific memory B cell (MBCs) using as bait the stabilized Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 S protein antigen which was encoded by the mRNA vaccine. The single cell sorting strategy was performed as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, MBCs prefusion S protein trimer-specific (S protein<sup>+</sup>), class-switched MBCs (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>) were single-cell sorted and then incubated for two weeks to naturally produce and release mAbs into the supernatant. A total of 2,352 and 3,532 S protein<sup>+</sup> MBCs were sorted from seronegative and seropositive vaccinees respectively (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>
</bold>). Of these 944 (40.1%) and 2,299 (65.1%) respectively, released in the supernatant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the S protein prefusion trimer in ELISA (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>
</bold>; <bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>
</bold>). These mAbs were then tested in a cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay (CPE-MN) with the original Wuhan live SARS-CoV-2 virus at a single point dilution (1:5) to identify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (nAbs). This first screening identified a total of 411 nAbs, of which 71 derived from seronegatives and 340 were from seropositives(<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>
</bold>; <bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>
</bold>). Overall, the fraction of S protein-specific B cells producing nAbs were 7.5% for seronegatives and 14.8% for seropositives. Following this first screening, all nAbs able to neutralize the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus were tested by CPE-MN against major variants of concern (VoCs) including the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) to understand the breadth of neutralization of nAbs elicited by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. At the time of this assessment the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant was not yet spread globally and therefore it was not available for screening. Seropositives had an overall higher percentage of nAbs neutralizing the VoCs compared to seronegatives. The average frequency of nAbs from seropositives neutralizing the alpha, beta and gamma variants was 80.6 (n=274), 39.4 (n=134) and 62.0% (n=211) respectively, compared to 70.4 (n=50), 22.5 (n=16) and 43.6% (n=31) respectively in seronegatives (<bold>

<sec id="S5">
<title>High potency and breadth of neutralization in seropositive COVID-19 vaccinees</title>
<p id="P5">To better characterize and understand the potency and breadth of coverage of all Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 nAbs, we aimed to express as immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) all the 411 nAbs previously identified. We were able to recover and express 276 antibodies for further characterization, 224 (89.8%) from seropositives and 52 (10.2%) from seronegatives. Initially, antibodies were tested for binding against the RBD, NTD and the S2-domain of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Overall, no major differences were observed in nAbs that recognized the RBD and NTD with 71.2% (n=37) and 79.5% (n=178) nAbs binding the RBD, while 17.3% (n=9) and 16.5% (n=37) nAbs binding the NTD for seronegatives and seropositives respectively (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>
</bold>). None of the tested nAbs targeted the S2 domain. The biggest difference between groups was seen for nAbs able to bind the S protein only in its trimeric conformation i.e. not able to bind single domains. This class of nAbs was almost 3-fold higher in seronegatives compared to seropositives (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>
</bold>). nAbs were then tested by CPE-MN in serial dilution to evaluate their 100% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>100</sub>) against the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus and the VoCs. At this stage of the study, the B.1.617.2 (delta) spread globally, and we were able to obtain the live virus for our experiments. Overall, nAbs isolated from seropositive vaccinees had a significantly higher potency than those isolated from seronegatives. The IC<sub>100</sub> geometric mean (GM-IC<sub>100</sub>) in seropositives was 2.87, 2.17-, 1.17-, 1.43-, and 1.92-fold lower than in seronegatives for the Wuhan virus, the alpha, beta, gamma and delta VoCs respectively (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>
</bold>). In addition, a bigger fraction of nAbs from seropositives retained the ability to neutralize the VoCs. Indeed, when nAbs were individually tested against all VoCs, the ability to neutralize the alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants was lost by 14, 61, 61 and 29% of the antibodies from seropositives versus 32, 78, 75 and 46% respectively of those from seronegatives. The overall number of nAbs that lost neutralizing activity against the beta and gamma VoCs was very high, (75-78% in seronegatives and 61% in seropositives), while it was much lower for the alpha and delta variants (32-46% for seronegatives and 14-29% for seropositives) (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>
</bold>). Finally, a major difference between seronegatives and seropositives was found in the class of medium/high potency nAbs (IC<sub>100</sub> of 11-100 ng/mL and 101-1000 ng/mL) against all variants. Indeed, nAbs in these ranges from seropositives constitute the 71.0%, 62.5%, 23.7%, 22.8%, 53,1% of the whole nAbs repertoire while nAbs from seronegative donors were 48.1%, 38.5%, 17.3%, 17.3%, 34.6% against the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus and alpha, beta, gamma and delta VoCs respectively (<bold>

<title>Functional gene repertoire of neutralizing antibodies</title>
<p id="P6">The analysis of the immunoglobulin G heavy chain variable (IGHV) and joining (IGHJ) gene rearrangements of 58 and 278 sequences recovered from seronegative and seropositive subjects respectively, showed that they use a broad range of germlines and share the most abundant. In particular, both groups predominantly used the IGHV1-69;IGHJ4-1 and IGHV3-53;IGHJ6-1, which were shared by three out five subjects per each group (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>
</bold>). In addition, the IGHV3-30;IGHJ6-1 and IGHV3-33;IGHJ4-1 germlines, more abundant in seronegative donors, and IGHV1-2;IGHJ6-1, mainly expanded in seropositive vaccinees, were also used with high frequency in both groups. Only the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline was seen to be predominantly expanded only in seropositive donors (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>
</bold>). To better characterize these predominant gene families, we evaluated their neutralization potency and breadth against SARS-CoV-2 and VoCs. In this analyses we could not evaluate IGHV3-33;IGHJ4-1 nAbs, as only three of these antibodies were expressed, but we included the IGHV3-53 closely related family IGHV3-66;IGHJ4-1, as this family was previously described to be mainly involved in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. A large part of nAbs deriving from these predominant germlines had a very broad range of neutralization potency against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus with IC<sub>100</sub> spanning from less than 10 to over 10,000 ng/mL (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B - G</xref>
</bold>). However, many of them lost the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. The loss of neutralizing activity occurred for most germlines and it was moderate against the alpha and delta variants, while it was dramatic against the beta and gamma variants (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B - G</xref>
</bold>). A notable exception was the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, present only in nAbs of seropositive patients, that showed potent antibodies able to equally neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>
</bold>). Finally, we evaluated the CDRH3-length and V-gene somatic hyper mutation (SHM) levels for all nAbs retrieved from seronegatives and seropositives and for predominant germlines. Overall, the two groups show a similar average CDRH3-length (15.0 aa and 15.1 aa for seronegatives and seropositives respectively), however seropositives showed almost 2-fold higher V-gene mutation levels compared to seronegatives (<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>
</bold>). As for predominant gene derived nAbs, we observed heterogenous CDRH3-length, with the only exception of IGHV3-53;IGHJ6-1 nAbs, and higher V-gene mutation levels in seropositives predominant germlines compared to seronegatives (<bold>

<title>Epitope mapping of neutralizing antibodies</title>
<p id="P7">To map the regions of the S protein recognized by the identified nAbs we used a competition assay with four known antibodies: J08, which targets the top loop of the receptor binding motif (RBM)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, S309, which binds the RBD but outside of the RMB region<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>(<bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>
</bold>). The nAbs identified in this study were pre-incubated with the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 S protein and subsequently the four nAbs labeled with different fluorophores were added as single mix. 50% signal reduction for one of the four fluorescently labelled nAbs, was used as threshold for positive competition. The vast majority of nAbs from both seronegative (50.0%; n=26) and seropositive (51.3%; n=115) vaccinees competed with J08 (<bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>
</bold>). For seronegatives, the second most abundant population was composed by nAbs that did not compete with any of the four fluorescently labelled nAbs (25.0%; n=13) followed by nAbs targeting the NTD (17.3%; n=9). As for seropositives, the second most abundant population was composed by nAbs that competed with S309 (21.4%; n=48) followed by nAbs competing with 4A8 (15.6%; n=35) and not-competing nAbs (11.6%; n=26).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P8">Our study analyzed for the first time at single cell level the repertoire of B cells producing neutralizing antibodies following vaccination of naïve and previously infected people. The most important conclusion from this work is that vaccinating people that are already seropositive to the virus, because of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, induces neutralizing antibodies which are more potent and less susceptible to escape from SARS-CoV-2 variants. This conclusion is not surprising since several papers have already reported that vaccination of convalescent people induces a hybrid immunity with titers of neutralizing antibodies up to 50-fold higher than those induced by vaccination of naïve people<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. The novelty of our work lies in the molecular analysis of this response which shows that seropositive subjects respond to vaccination with more B cells producing antibodies which show higher neutralization potency and are not susceptible to escape variants. In part this is due to potent antibodies derived from the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline which was only found in seropositive people. The absence of this germline in naïve vaccinees is also confirmed by previous studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. One limitation of our study is that we did not include people that received a third booster dose of vaccine, as at the time that this work was being performed no policies for a third booster dose were implemented. In spite of this limitation, we believe that our conclusions are likely to be extendable to people that are seropositives following primary vaccination. Indeed, the S protein produced following vaccination with mRNA, viral vectors or following infection is produced in all cases by the cell of the host and it is likely to be presented to the immune system in a similar manner and generate a similar antibody response. This is confirmed by the fact that neutralizing antibodies following infection and vaccination derive mostly from the same immunodominant germlines, i.e. IGHV3-53, 3-30 and 3-66<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Our analysis suggests that a booster dose of vaccine will increase the frequency of memory B cells producing potent neutralizing antibodies not susceptible to escape variants and allow better control of this pandemic. Our work also shows that more than three quarters of antibodies neutralizing the Wuhan virus do not neutralize at all the beta and gamma variants, while the fraction of antibodies not neutralizing the alpha and delta variants is much smaller and in all cases below 50%. This suggest that the beta and gamma variants were originally selected to escape natural immunity, while the alpha and gamma were selected mostly for their increased infectivity and ability to spread in the population<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. The massive escape from predominant germlines, such as IGHV3-53, 3-66, 3-30 and 1-69, and the presence of antibodies deriving from germline IGHV2-5 that are completely insensitive to the existing variants, suggest that the design of vaccines that preferentially promote or avoid the expansion of selected germlines can generate broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Germline-targeting vaccination, which has been pioneered in the HIV field<sup>

<title>Identification of cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific nAbs.</title>
<p>(A) The graph shows supernatants tested for binding to the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 S protein antigen stabilized in its prefusion conformation. Threshold of positivity has been set as two times the value of the blank (dotted line). Dark blue and red dots represent mAbs that bind to the S protein for seronegative and seropositive vaccinees respectively. Light blue and red dots represent mAbs that do not bind the S protein for seronegative and seropositive vaccinees. (B) The bar graph shows the percentage of not-neutralizing (gray), neutralizing mAbs from seronegatives (dark blue), and neutralizing mAbs for seropositives (dark red). The total number (n) of antibodies tested per individual is shown on top of each bar (C) Graphs show the fold change percentage of nAbs in seronegatives and seropositives against the alpha, beta and gamma VoCs compared to the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. The heatmaps show the overall percentage of Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 nAbs able to neutralize tested VoCs.</p>

<title>Potency and breadth of neutralization of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 and VoCs.</title>
<p>(A - E) Scatter dot charts show the neutralization potency, reported as IC<sub>100</sub> (ng/mL), of nAbs tested against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus (A) and the B.1.1.7 (B), B.1.351 (C), B.1.1.248 (D) and B.1.617.2 (E) VoCs. The number and percentage of nAbs from seronegatives vs seropositives, fold-change and statistical significance are denoted on each graph. A nonparametric Mann–Whitney t test was used to evaluate statistical significances between groups. Significances are shown as *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, and ****p &lt; 0.0001. (F) The table shows the IC<sub>100</sub> geometric mean (GM) of all nAbs pulled together from each group against all SARS-CoV-2 viruses tested.</p>
