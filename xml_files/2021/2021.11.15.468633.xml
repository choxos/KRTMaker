<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the binding of its spike glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, highly expressed in several organs, but very low in the brain. The mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infects neurons is not understood. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), actin-based intercellular conduits that connect distant cells, allow the transfer of cargos, including viruses. Here, we explored the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and whether TNTs are involved in its spreading between cells <italic>in vitro.</italic> We report that neuronal cells, not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 through an exocytosis/endocytosis dependent pathway, can be infected when co-cultured with permissive infected epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 induces TNTs formation between permissive cells and exploits this route to spread to uninfected permissive cells in co-culture. Correlative Cryo-electron tomography reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the plasma membrane of TNTs formed between permissive cells and virus-like vesicular structures are inside TNTs established both between permissive cells and between permissive and non-permissive cells. Our data highlight a potential novel mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spreading which could serve as route to invade non-permissive cells and potentiate infection in permissive cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">COVID-19, the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been developing into a global pandemic since the first reported events in December 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory tract and the majority of COVID-19 patients present severe respiratory symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), other organs such as the intestine, liver, kidneys, heart and brain are also affected. Neurological manifestations of different gravity associated with the COVID-19 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Interestingly the neurological symptoms can be acute and resolve with the disease or can represent a major issue in the case of long-COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the central nervous system (CNS) is not surprising given that several types of coronavirus (CoV) (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV) have been reported to invade and persist in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In addition, case reports have shown that the brain tissue of patients that died following COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">However, how SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the CNS and how infection leads to neurological symptoms is still not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion could be achieved through several routes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and once it reaches the CNS it could bind the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor exposed on neuronal cells to infect the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). ACE2 receptor is the main actor responsible of the virus entry in the lower respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To enter host cells the viral spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses bind the enzymatic domain of the ACE2 receptor, which is exposed on the surface of the cells forming the oral cavity and the oropharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). While the expression of the ACE2 receptor has been well documented in many cell type and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), it is important to underline that in human brain the expression of the ACE2 receptor is low, with the exception of brain areas such as the thalamus and the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). For this reason, it is not clear how the virus can propagate through the brain, and it is a priority to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 enters into neuronal cells in order to provide new insights in the understanding of the neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P4">An interesting aspect to consider is that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins has been found in anatomically distinct regions of the brain of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In this respect, the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is reminiscent of toxic amyloid proteins in neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), that propagate in the brain according to the progression of the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">We have previously shown that the spreading of different amyloid aggregates between cells of the CNS and from peripheral lymphoid system cells to neurons occurs mainly through Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). TNTs are thin, membranous conduits rich in actin that form contiguous cytoplasmic bridges between cells over long and short distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Recently we set up a pipeline in correlative cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-CLEM) to determine the ultrastructure of TNTs in neuronal cell lines, demonstrating their structural identity and differentiating them from other cellular protrusion as filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Functionally, TNTs allow direct transport of cargos including virus between distant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Of specific interest, it has been documented that viruses from different families induce increased formation of TNTs or TNT-like structures, using these membranous structures to efficiently spread the infection to neighboring health cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Here, we investigated the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and whether TNTs are involved in its intercellular spreading. Since TNT-transferred virions would not necessarily be exposed outside the host cell, we hypothesize that TNT-mediated transmission can be used by the viruses to escape neutralizing antibody activity and immune surveillance, as well as to infect less permissive cells lacking the membrane receptor for virus entry, thus allowing for spreading of virus tropism and pathogenicity. Our data show that human neuronal cells, not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 through an exocytosis/endocytosis dependent pathway, can be infected when co-cultured with permissive epithelial cells, previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. We observed, in confocal microscopy, that SARS-CoV-2, induced the formation of TNTs that then could be used by the virus to efficiently spread toward uninfected permissive and non-permissive cells. Furthermore, by setting up correlative Cryo-CLEM and–tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 virions are associated to the plasma membrane of TNTs formed between permissive cells. Interestingly, we also observed virus-like vesicular structures and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) inside the TNTs, both between permissive cells and between permissive and non-permissive cells.</p>
<p id="P6">Altogether, our results shed new light on the structure of the viral particles undergoing intercellular spreading and provide important information about the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. They support the role of TNTs in the viral spreading in both permissive and non-permissive cells, possibly enhancing the efficiency of viral propagation through the body.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 can spread among cells through an exocytosis/endocytosis independent pathway</title>
<p id="P7">The main route of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell is determined by the binding of the spike (S) glycoproteins, exposed on its surface, with the membrane protein ACE2 as an entry receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Current data indicate that this receptor is only expressed in low amounts in the brain, so the question is whether and how the virus is able to infect neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). To this aim we tested different cell types to verify whether they were permissive to viral infection by the receptor-mediated pathway.</p>
<p id="P8">Different cells of mammalian and human origin were plated on a 96 multi-well plate and infected with a MOI (multiplicity of infection) ranging from 10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>. The cell-lines used in this assay included human colon epithelial cell-lines (Caco-2,), monkey kidney epithelial cell-line (Vero E6), and the human (SH-SY5Y) and murine (CAD) neuronal cells lines. After 3 days we looked for productive infection by staining the infected monolayers with a virus-specific antibody and by titrating the virus released in the supernatant. Using these two parameters we found that only the epithelial Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells were susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), while both neuronal cell lines (mouse and human) did not show any sign of infection or viral production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S1A, B</xref>). Consistently, the immunofluorescent signal of the viral Nucleoprotein (N) protein was evident in the monolayers of Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells after 3 days of infection with different MOI. On the contrary, no fluorescent signal was detected in CAD, and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S1A</xref>). In addition, an aliquot of the supernatant from the MOI 0.1 infection was collected at day 2 and 3 to quantify the kinetic of virus production by titration using a semisolid plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S1 B</xref>, no viral production was detected using the supernatant derived from CAD and SH-SY5Y infection, while clear signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) were detected in Vero E6 cells infected with Vero E6 and Caco-2 supernatants.</p>
<p id="P9">These data show that neuronal cells cannot be infected directly from the supernatant through a receptor-mediated mechanism.</p>
<p id="P10">The main mediator of cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is the ACE2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>); whilst it is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) , it was detected at extremely low levels in the neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Consistently, we were unable to detect a signal for ACE2 in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S2</xref>), confirming previous observation reporting extremely low levels of expression in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Nonetheless, emerging case reports showed that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have common neurological manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) suggesting that the virus could invade and infect the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Since the ACE2 receptor is not widely expressed in neuronal cells one likely possibility is that the virus can exploit intercellular communication pathways to enter neuronal cells directly from permissive cells, which would allow bypassing the main receptor mediated pathway. To investigate this, we set up co-culture experiments between permissive Vero E6 cells, routinely used as infection model of SARS-CoV-2, and non-permissive SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells. Vero E6 cells (donor cells) infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.05 for 48 hours were co-cultured with SH-SY5Y cells (acceptor cells) previously transfected with a plasmid encoding mCherry, to be easily distinguished from donor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S3A</xref>). After 24h and 48h of co-culture, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-N antibody recognising SARS-CoV2 nucleoproteins, and labelled with cell mask blue to stain the whole cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). By using confocal microscopy, and the ICY software (<italic>icy.bioimageanalysis.org</italic>), we calculated the percentage of SH-SY5Y acceptor cells positive for the anti-N antibody immunostaining. After 24h of co-culture, 36,4% of acceptor cells contained in their cytoplasm spots recognised by the anti-N antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), and this percentage increased to 62,5% after 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). To further investigate the nature of the viral particles, present in acceptor neuronal cells, additional co-cultures between Vero E6 infected with SARS-CoV2 MOI of 0.05 and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were immunostained (after 24h and 48h of co-culture) using an anti-Spike (anti-S) antibody, both alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-F</xref>) and in combination with the anti-N antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H-J</xref>). Similar to the results obtained with the N-antibody, we found that after 24h of co-culture 21,8 % of acceptor cells contained in their cytoplasm spots positive for the anti-S antibody, and after 48h of co-culture this value increased to 42,4 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). We then evaluated the co-localization of the two viral proteins N and S in the acceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H-J</xref>) and we found that at 48h the PCC (Pearson’s coefficient) was in average 0,716, indicating that the two proteins partially colocalize. While separate signals for anti-N and anti-S antibodies could be suggestive of virus uncoating during the first step of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), colocalization of N and S proteins could correspond to mature virions inside endocytic vesicles that are entering the cell and/or to newly synthetized virions assembled in the neuronal acceptor cells. Because at 24 hours we found negligible colocalization between the two proteins, we could assume that the particles labelled with both the N and S antibodies in the neuronal cells at 48 hours correspond to virus newly assembled in the SH-SY5Y cells after transfer. Indeed at 24 hours of co-culture Vero E6 cell are already full of newly synthetized virions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S3 B, C</xref>), therefore if there was direct transfer of fully assembled virions we would have expected to find them in acceptor cells already at 24h of co-culture, which was not the case.</p>
<p id="P11">To directly investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 transferred from the donor cells was still functional, and able to replicate in neuronal cells, we performed an immunostaining using the anti-dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) antibody J2 that is the gold standard for the detection of dsRNA in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). After 48h of co-culture (Vero E6 infected cells as donors and SH-SY5Y cells as acceptors), cells were fixed and immunostained to detect dsRNA and SARS-CoV-2 particles using the anti-S antibody. We found J2 positive signal both in donor Vero E6 infected cells and acceptor SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Interestingly, J2 signal in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) corresponds to bright foci of different sizes and intensities, that could represent the replication organelles (RO) or double-membrane vesicle (DMVs) where viral RNA synthesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Furthermore, the localization of J2 spots in the perinuclear/ER region of acceptor cells could suggest an active viral replication occurring in the neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Accordingly, J2 signal was specific for infected cells in co-culture as it was not detected in non-infected Vero E6 co-cultured with SH-SY5Y mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), as well as, in the negative control in which the co-culture was incubated only with the secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 transferred by a cell-to-cell contact-dependent mechanism could be actively replicated in neuronal acceptor cells.</p>
<p id="P12">To support this hypothesis, as complementary approach we performed an immunostaining against the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), an essential component of the viral replication/transcription complex. After 48h of co-culture (Vero E6 infected cells as donors and SH-SY5Y cells as acceptors), cells were fixed and immunostained to detect nsp3 and SARS-CoV-2 particles (by anti-N). We found cytoplasmic accumulations containing the viral N protein and the non-structural protein nsp3 both in donor Vero E6 and acceptor SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). This data confirms that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the acceptor neuronal cells. The above data show that neuronal cells can be infected when in co-culture with permissive cells, but do not address the mechanism. Although our data show that SH-SY5Y cells cannot be infected by the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig S1</xref>), in order to investigate the possible contribution of the endocytic entry pathway in co-culture conditions, as control for the co-culture experiments, we performed “secretion tests” were the supernatants from Vero E6 infected cells were used to infect SH-SY5Y cells for 24h and 48h respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4A</xref>). We did not detect any signal for anti-N and anti-S antibodies in the acceptor cells that received the supernatants from the infected Vero E6 cells after 24h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4B, C</xref>); and a negligible signal was found at 48h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4C</xref>). On the other end, the supernatants from Vero E6 infected cells was able to infect control</p>
<p id="P13">Vero E6 cells where we could detect both anti-N and anti-S signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4D</xref>). The infectious titer of the supernatant used in the secretion experiment in Vero E6 acceptor cells was calculated using a focus forming assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4E</xref>). Additionally, the 48h supernatants from donor infected cells, co-culture and secretion experiments were used to assess viral production by focus forming assay titration protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S4F</xref>).</p>

<title>TNTs contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 transmission</title>
<p id="P14">The results described above provide evidence that while SARS-CoV-2 entry into epithelial cells is mediated by the classical exo/endocytosis pathway, the spreading between permissive cells and non-permissive neuronal cells could occur in a direct cell-to-cell contact dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that viruses of many different families, including retroviruses such as HIV, and enveloped viruses like herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and several others trigger the formation of TNTs or TNT-like structures in infected cells and use these structures to efficiently spread to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). We therefore explored whether TNTs could be a mechanism involved in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 to non-permissive neuronal cells. To detect TNTs between Vero E6 and SH-SY5Y cells we used cell Mask Blue, which stains the entire cell cytosol and outlines the entire cell shape. To properly identify TNTs by confocal microscopy it is crucial to distinguish them from other actin driven membranous protrusions such as filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). TNTs hover above the substrate and even over other cells, and unlike dorsal filopodia, TNTs are able to connect two or more distant cells. Based on these criteria, first we assessed the presence of TNTs in control co-culture between Vero E6 cells and SH-SY5Y cells expressing the NLS-GFP (Nucleal Localization Signal) and stained with rhodamine phalloidin (for cellular membrane and actin labelling). We observed heterotypic TNTs formed between Vero E6 cells and SH-SY5Y NLS-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S5A, B</xref>). Strikingly, we also observed TNTs between SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 donor cells and mCherry-SH-SY5Y acceptor cells in co-culture that contained particles stained with anti-N antibody, which were also found inside the cytoplasm of the acceptor neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A, B</xref>). In addition, we found TNTs between SH-SY5Y acceptor cells, which also contained anti-N labelled particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 C, D</xref>). Altogether the data presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be transferred in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner (likely TNT-mediated) from permissive cells to non-permissive neuronal cells. The evidence showing N-labelled particles in TNTs between neuronal cells suggests that once reached non-permissive cells infection could be further spread among them via TNTs.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM reveals viral compartments in TNTs between permissive and non-permissive cells</title>
<p id="P15">Next, we wanted to identify the nature and structure of the viral particles shared by TNTs and investigate the mechanisms allowing their TNT-mediated transfer to non-permissive cells (eg, whether the infectious particles were using TNTs as membrane bridges to surf on top, or as channels to be transferred inside the tube). To this aim we set up a correlative fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy and tomography approach (CLEM, cryo-EM and cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). These techniques allowed us to assess for the first time in correlative mode, both SARS-CoV-2 and TNTs architecture in the closest to native conditions. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.05) and 48h post infection were seeded on Cryo-EM grids in co-culture with SH-SY5Y mCherry cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5 F</xref>). Before vitrification, the EM grids were imaged by fluorescence microscopy (FM) after labelling cells with either cell mask blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) or wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) conjugated with a 488 fluorochrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>) in order to identify TNTs (for details see material and methods). Consistent with our previous data, we detected TNTs between Vero E6 and SH-SY5Y mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). By using the grid finders after vitrification, we could identify precisely the TNTs position and image them at the ultrastructure level using both Glacios Cryo-TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-E</xref>) and Titan Krios cryo-TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F-K</xref>). Strikingly, TNTs connecting Vero E6 infected cells and SH-SY5Y mCherry cells (labelled with cell mask blue) revealed the presence, inside the tube, of membranous structures of various sizes resembling DMVs (double-membrane vesicles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). DMVs have been identified as the central hub for SARS-Cov2-RNA synthesis Klein et al, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Furthermore, as shown in the tomogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5I</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>, the TNT also contained many vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I-K</xref> blue arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). Of note, we never observed DMVs and such crowding of vesicular structures inside TNTs between Vero E6 and SH-SY5Y mCherry cells in control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 3</xref>), where we could rather see isolated vesicles or organelles as in the case of the mitochondrion shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 3</xref>.</p>
<p id="P16">Since SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with proliferation of membranes and presence of DMVs where viral replication is taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), it is possible that these structures represent viral replicative complexes being transferred to the acceptor cells.</p>

<title>TNTs facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in permissive Vero E6 cells</title>
<p id="P17">Altogether, these data suggested that TNT can allow the intercellular spreading of the infection from permissive to non-permissive cells. Next, we wondered whether the TNT-mediated route dedicated to invading non-permissive cells could also be used to enhance the spreading of the virus between permissive cells in addition to the endocytic route. We therefore analysed whether SARS-CoV-2 exploits TNTs for cell-to-cell spread between Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). By confocal microscopy, we observed that in uninfected Vero E6 a low percentage of cells were connected by TNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, C</xref>), but this percentage was substantially increased already after 24h of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). Strikingly, after immunostaining using either the anti N antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) and anti S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>) alone or both anti N and anti S antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>) we could observe particles positive for one or both antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-E</xref>), suggesting that also mature virions could spread through TNTs between permissive cells. To verify the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2, can use the TNT route to spread between permissive cells we decided to block the infection through the endocytic pathway. To this aim we used a neutralizing antibody which binds to the RBD domain of the spike protein (anti-SARS-CoV-2 human IgG C3 235) thus blocking binding to ACE2 receptor and the receptor-mediated entry of the virus. A preliminary experiment was set up to identify the minimal concentration of antibody sufficient to achieve neutralization of the viral stock of 1-5 × 10<sup>5</sup> FFU/ml used to infect Vero E6 cells. The viral stock was incubated 1h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with three different concentrations of IgG C3 235 (1, 10 and 100 μg/ml) and then used to infect monolayers of Vero E6 cells for 48h. Viral production was then assessed by titration of the supernatant by focus forming assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S7</xref>) both 100 and 10 μg/ml concentration of antibody were enough to elicit complete neutralization of the viral stock, resulting in no sign of viral production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S7</xref>). Therefore, a concentration of 10 μg/ml was set as the minimal concentration to investigate cell-to-cell transfer in Vero E6 cells.</p>
<p id="P18">As usual, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 MOI 0,05 (donor cells) for 48 hours, but then incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG C3 235 for 1 hour at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, prior co-culturing in presence of the antibody, with Vero E6 cells expressing mCherry (acceptor cells), to distinguish them from the infected donor population. After 24h and 48h hours cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-N antibody. By using confocal microscopy and ICY software we evaluated the percentage of Vero E6 acceptor cells containing anti N positive viral particles both in control condition and in the presence of the blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). Interestingly, after 24h of co-culture in presence of the anti-S neutralizing antibody, 42,9% of acceptor cells were positive for SARS-CoV-2 detected by anti-N immunostaining, and this percentage increased to 63,8% after 48h of co-culture, compared to co-culture control conditions (not incubated with the anti-S neutralizing antibody) where respectively 95% at 24h and 96,8% at 48h of acceptor cells were positive for anti-N immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). As control, to verify the absence of infectious virus in the supernatant of the coculture treated with the anti-S neutralizing antibody, we challenged naïve Vero E6 cells with the supernatants of both the co-cultures (incubated/and not with the 235 Ab) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D-F</xref>). While 100% of cells infected with the untreated supernatant were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D, F</xref>), no infection could be detected in the cells challenged with the treated supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E, F</xref>). Furthermore, the supernatants of each condition were collected to determine the virus concentration using the focus forming assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">These data show that despite the block of the receptor-mediated virus entry, Vero E6 cells could be infected when put in co-culture with infected cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 can spread also between permissive cells through a secretion- independent pathway.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM reveals SARS-Cov-2 on top of TNTs</title>
<p id="P20">To uncover the nature of the particles labelled with anti-N and anti-S antibodies in TNTs by fluorescence microscopy and to discriminate if they were localised inside or on top of TNTs between permissive cells we used again correlative fluorescence cryo-EM and cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.05) and 48h post infection seeded on Cryo-EM grids. After having identified by FM the exact location of the TNT connecting Vero E6 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>), the EM-grids were cryo-fixated and analysed by cryo-EM. High-quality 3D images using a Titan Krios Microscope revealed SARS-CoV-2 viral particles located on the surface of TNTs-connecting two Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8 D-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 particles that decorate the TNTs’ surface displayed both an ellipsoidal and spherical enveloped morphology with an average diameter ranging from 50 to 100 nm typically of a coronavirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>). In our tomograms and in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref> we can clearly discern the most distinctive features of the virus: the spike proteins that decorate the surface of the viral particles, together with the ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) organized inside the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8 D-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary movie 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>) in accordance with recent cryo-EM data for the virus isolated from infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) and cryo-FIB SEM pictures of the intracellular virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">The presence of the virus on top of TNTs was observed only in permissive cells, and not in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This difference could be explained by the presence of the ACE2 receptor, which is only expressed on the cell surface and TNT membranes of Vero E6 cells and not on SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">fig. S2</xref>). We also observed vesicular structures (average diameter of 50-100 nm) inside TNTs connecting Vero E6 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref> green arrowhead and Movie 4), similar to the ones observed in the TNT between Vero E6 infected cells and SH-SY5Y mCherry cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie 2</xref>). As the observation inside TNTs is more challenging compared to the analysis of the TNT surface, in order to unequivocally demonstrate that these vesicular structures corresponded to the virus and/or viral compartments, we set-up a challenging correlative IF cryo-EM protocol making use of the anti-S antibody. SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, seeded on EM grids, were fixed and processed for an immunostaining against the Spike proteins (anti-S). Before cryo-fixing the EM grids, we selected the TNTs connecting cells that were positive for the anti-S by using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>) and then observed in the same position at cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B-D</xref>). In correspondence of the fluorescent anti-S antibody signal in TNTs coming from a Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9A</xref>), we could observe structures resembling SARS-CoV-2 particles that decorate the TNTs’ surface with both a spherical and an ellipsoidal enveloped morphology and spike-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie 5</xref>). Note that the images here are less clear compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">supplementary figure 8</xref> as in this case the grids were acquired with Glacios Cryo-TEM instead of Titan Krios cryo-TEM. Interestingly, in correspondence of the S antibody we observed multiple vesicular structures inside the TNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D, H-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie 5</xref>), similar to the ones observed inside TNTs between permissive and non permissive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I-K</xref> blue arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). Considering that cryo-ET resolution is limited by the thickness of the sample, and the fact that TNTs described here have an average diameter of more than 500 nm, we were at the resolution limits and we were not able to discriminate the precise structures of these vesicular compartments. Therefore, besides stating the fact that these structures were found in correspondence of S antibody, we cannot be sure whether they are mature virions as the ones observed outside the TNTs.</p>
<p id="P22">Our observations are in line with the recent publication by Caldas and colleagues showing by classical scanning electron microscopy that SARS-CoV-2 particles appear surf on top of cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). However, in this case the authors did not enquire whether these protrusions were TNTs and whether they allowed viral transfer. Thus, despite several reports describing virus of different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) on top of filopodia and/or cellular extension, including SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), our report represents the first evidence that TNTs could be one possible route for the spreading of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P23">Our study is carried out using Vero E6 cell line as epithelial model since it has been widely employed for SARS-CoV-2 isolation, propagation, and antiviral testing, due to its high virus production and a prominent cytopathic effect (CPE) upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Our choice of SH-SY5Y cell line as neuronal model of non-permissive cells is justified not only because these cells are human and widely used as neuronal model, but also because we have thoroughly characterized their TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and able to identify them with high reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). An ideal neuronal model could be represented by primary neurons, however in primary neurons it is very difficult to discriminate TNT-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and it is even more challenging to apply correlative cryo-light and electron microscopy and–tomography approach. In the future it will be important to confirm these data using a different neuronal model like iPSC-derived human neurons that are able to recapitulate the complexity of human neurons. Furthermore, as we demonstrated here that TNTs allow the passage of the virus between permissive cells this work sets the basis to investigate the potential role of TNTs in allowing the spreading of the virus from the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity to the olfactory sensory neurons in the central nervous system (CNS).</p>
<p id="P24">Overall, within the limitation of our study mentioned above, our report provides unique structural information of SARS-CoV-2 and how it could use TNTs for its spreading between permissive cells and non-permissive cells (e.g., neuronal cells), thus increasing both viral tropism and infection efficiency. These results also pave the way to further investigations on the role of cell-to-cell communication in SARS-CoV-2 spreading to the brain in more physiological contexts, and on alternative therapeutically approaches to impair viral spreading in addition to the current investigations mainly focused on blocking the spike-receptor interactions.</p>

Donor cells were incubated in presence of the antibody for 1 hour at 37°C 5% CO2. Afterward, donor cells were co-cultured in a ratio 1:1 with mCherry-Vero -E6 acceptor cells in DMEM 5% FBS with 10 ug/ml of the afore mentioned neutralizing antibody. The co-cultures were incubated for 24 and 48h hours 37°C 5% CO2. Then, co-cultures were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min and immunostained for the anti-N (protocol described above) and with HCS Cell Mask TM Blue Stain (Invitrogen, 1:300). Images were acquired on an LSM 700 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 40X objective. After image acquisition, number of acceptor cells, which had received SARS-CoV-2 identified by the anti-N immunostaining were quantified ICY software as before. In parallel, supernatant of each conditions was then collected to assess viral neutralization using Focus Forming Assay (FFA) titration protocol. For the secretion test, performed in parallel with the co-culture, an aliquot of the supernatant from donor was incubated with 10 ug/ml of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG C3 235 for 1h at 37°C, in order to neutralize the viral particles, present in the supernatant. In parallel another aliquot was left untreated, for comparison. The supernatants were then added on top of acceptors cells. Afterwards, we proceed for the analysis as before mentioned.</p>

<title>TNT counting</title>
<p id="P43">For quantification of TNT-connected cells, Vero-E6 cells infected (as described before) and not infected were trypsinised and counted; 50,000 cells were plated on 24 glass coverslips. After 24h, cells were fixed (15 min at 37 °C in 2% PFA, 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 0.2 M HEPES in PBS, and then additionally fixed for 15 min in 4% PFA and 0.2 M HEPES in PBS). Cells were carefully washed in PBS, labeled for 20 min at RT with a 3.3 μg/μL solution of Wheat-Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Alexa Fluor©-647 nm conjugate (Invitrogen) in PBS, washed again and mounted. The whole cellular volume was imaged by acquiring 0.45 μm Z-stacks with an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700) using ZEN software. TNT-connected cells, cells connected by straight WGA-labeled structures that do not touch the substrate, were manually counted by ICY software using semi-automatized TNT counting tool as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). The 3D rendering of TNTs were performed using IMARIS software.</p>

<title>Cell preparation for cryo-EM</title>
<p id="P44">Carbon-coated gold TEM grids (Quantifoil NH2A R2/2) were glow-discharged at 2 mA and 1.5–1.8 × 10-1 m bar for 1 min in an ELMO (Cordouan) glow discharge system. Grids were sterilized under UV three times for 30 min at RT and then incubated at 37 °C in complete culture medium for 2h. 200,000 Vero-E6-infected cells (after 48h post infection) were counted and seed on cryo-EM grids positioned in 35 mm Ibidi μ-Dish (Biovalley, France). For co-culture, 100,000 Vero E6-infected cells (after 48h post infection) were co-cultured with 100,000 mCherry-SH-SY5Y on cryo-EM grids in 35 mm Ibidi μ-Dish (Biovalley, France). After 24h of cells resulted in 3 to 4 cells per grid square. Prior to chemical and cryo-plunging freezing, cells were labeled with WGA-Alexa-488 (1:300 in PBS) for 5 min at 37 °C. For correlative light- and cryo-electron microscopy, cells were chemically fixed in 2% PFA + 0.05% GA in 0.2 M Hepes for 15 min followed by fixation in 4% PFA in 0.2 M Hepes for 15 min and kept hydrated in PBS buffer prior to vitrification.</p>
<p id="P45">For correlative light- and cryo-electron microscopy using the anti-S primary antibody, cells were fixed with PFA 4% for 15 min at 37 °C, quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl for 15 min, and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA (w/v) for ON at 4 °C. Cells were labeled with an anti-human AlexaFluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:500 and labelled with HCS Cell Mask TM Blue Stain (Invitrogen, 1:300). For cell vitrification, cells were blotted from the back side of the grid for 8 s and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane using a Leica EMGP system as we performed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p>

<title>Cryo-electron tomography data acquisition and tomogram reconstruction</title>
<p id="P46">The cryo-EM data was collected from different grids at the Nanoimaging core facility of the Institut Pasteur using a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios G3i electron microscope with a Gatan Bioquantum energy filter and K3 detector. Tomography software from Thermo Scientific was used to acquire the data. Tomograms were acquired using dose-symmetric tilt scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>), a +/-60 degree tilt range with a tilt step 2 was used to acquire the tilt series. Tilt images were acquired in counting mode with a calibrated physical pixel size of 3.2 Å and total dose over the full tilt series of 3.295 e- /Å2 and dose rate of 39,739 e-/px/s with an exposure time of 1s. The defocus applied was in a range of -3 to - 6 μm defocus.</p>
<p id="P47">The tomograms showed in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> were performed on Glacios equipped with a field emission gun and operated at 200 kV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Falcon 3 direct electron detector. Tilt series were recorded using Tomography software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in counting mode and an angular range of – 60° to + 60° with a calibrated physical pixel size of 3.2 Å and a and total dose over the full tilt series of 3.49 e- /Å2 and dose rate 42,16 e-/px/s 3.49 e- /Å2 with 1 second exposure time, 70 um objective aperture. The defocus applied was in a range of -3 μm defocus.</p>
<p id="P48">The tomograms were reconstructed using eTomo. Final alignments were done by using 10 nm fiducial gold particles coated with BSA (BSA Gold Tracer, EMS). Gold beads were manually selected and automatically tracked. The fiducial model was corrected in all cases where the automatic tracking failed. Tomograms were binned 2x corresponding to a pixel size of 0.676 nm for the Titan and 0,6368 nm for the Glacios and SIRT-like filter option in eTomo was applied. For visualization purposes, the reconstructed volumes were processed by a Gaussian filter.</p>
