To protect the intestinal epithelium from such pathogens, mammals have developed sophisticated, multi-layered protective mechanisms. These include a range of innate immune defense factors produced by the intestinal epithelial cells, including mucus and antimicrobial peptides. Invasion of epithelial cells by bacterial pathogens triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. While the early steps of epithelial innate immune defence are well-characterized, the contributions of the different immune cells recruited to infected mucosa remain poorly understood. For example, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as <italic>Salmonella</italic> or S.Tm) infection of the mammalian intestinal epithelium induces cell death, expulsion of infected cells, inflammatory cytokine release, and activation of several types of cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, yet the relative contributions of each mechanism in the control of infection are unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Crucially, the role played by the cytotoxic activity of these various immune cells in controlling bacterial infection is unclear.</p><p id="P6">Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill target cells by the concerted actions of the serine proteases Granzymes (Gzm) and the pore-forming molecule Perforin, released from secretory granules at the site of contact with the target cell. Perforin mediates pore formation in the target cell membrane allowing for intracellular delivery of Gzms, where Gzms cleave critical intracellular substrates causing cell death. The human genome encodes 5 Gzms (A, B, H, K and M), whereas the mouse genome encodes 10 Gzms (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, and M)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Granzyme A (GzmA) and B (GzmB) are the most widely studied Gzms, as they are most highly expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes, and they are classically implicated as the effectors of granule exocytosis-mediated target cell death. GzmB induces target cell apoptosis mainly by cleaving and activating Caspase-3/7 directly or by activating mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast, GzmA can activate caspase-independent lytic cell death pathways but is less potent than GzmB. Evidence from several independent studies indicate that the key role of GzmA is to drive inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Loss of perforin (<italic>Prf1</italic>) in mice abolishes granule mediated target cell death, therefore perforin is considered essential for granzyme-driven apoptosis. However, GzmA or GzmB single knockout (KO) mice do not recapitulate the loss of cytotoxic lymphocyte activity seen in Prf1 KO animals, indicating some level of redundancy between different Gzms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Multiple studies have found that the individual loss of either GzmA or GzmB has no effect on the immune response to bacterial and viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, although perforin is clearly important for protection against various viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and even a few bacterial pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, extracellular levels of GzmA and GzmB were found to be increased in blood of humans infected with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests that both GzmA and GzmB have significant non-cytotoxic extracellular functions that involve cleavage of extracellular and intracellular proteins to promote wound healing, cytokine activation, inflammatory responses, and extracellular matrix remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">One subset of T lymphocytes that constitutively express GzmA and GzmB are intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IEL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. IEL are a heterogenous population of T cells that occupy the intercellular space between intestinal epithelial cells. IEL are classified into two main subpopulations based on ontogeny and surface receptor expression. Induced IEL consist of conventional TCRαβ CD8αβ T cells while natural IEL, characterized by the expression of CD8αα, are defined as TCRαβ CD8αα or TCRγδ CD8αα T cells. Despite developmental differences, both types of IEL are characterized by an activated phenotype that includes very high expression of GzmA and B, and lower expression of GzmC and GzmK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Based on the tissue location and Gzm expression, IEL have been postulated to play a key role in defending against intestinal infection by killing infected epithelial cells. One subtype, TCRγδ IEL, have been implicated in the defense against oral <italic>S.Tm</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and prevent transmigration of bacteria and parasites from the gut by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Changes in γδ IEL movement have been observed following infection with <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. IEL also protect against the intracellular protozoan parasite <italic>Eimeria vermiformis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Taken together, the available data are consistent with IEL being the first immune responders to enteric pathogens. However, the exact mechanism by which IEL protect against foodborne pathogens has remained opaque, and it is currently unknown whether IEL protective functions are mediated by Gzms.</p><p id="P8">Here we address a fundamental question: Are IEL-derived Gzms pivotal for protection against foodborne intracellular bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp? Previous studies using KO mice did not find a role for Perforin and GzmB in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but these experiments involved intravenous infections rather than the oral route of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, which is the more common route of human exposure. We reveal that GzmA and GzmB act together to defend the small intestinal epithelium against oral infection. The majority of GzmA and GzmB in the gut is expressed by IELs, and our data suggest that GzmA/B are responsible for the protective effects of IEL. Surprisingly, we discovered that in the absence of GzmA, GzmB promotes bacterial growth by providing apoptosis-derived nutrients, whereas in the absence of GzmB, GzmA is more effective in preventing bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier. Our findings reveal novel effector functions of Gzms in tissue-specific control of pathogens and explain how IEL contribute to intestinal protection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Loss of granzymes does not affect IEL homeostasis</title><p id="P9">IEL constitutively express high levels of both GzmA and GzmB, with ~20 million molecules of GzmA and ~5 million molecules of GzmB per cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Flow cytometric analyses of spleen, mLNs, small intestinal (SI) and large intestinal epithelium and lamina propria (LP) layers indicated that only the SI epithelium harbors a large population of GzmA/B expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) imaging of GzmA and GzmB in the gut, that showed overlapping expression of GzmA and GzmB mainly within small round cells just below intestinal epithelial cells, but above the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Specificities of antibodies for GzmA and GzmB for both IF and flow cytometry were confirmed using <italic>GzmA<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>GzmB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1A, E</xref>). These Gzm-expressing cells within the epithelium were T cells, as cells that stained positive for GzmB were also labelled with anti-CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Indeed, in the intestinal epithelial compartment, greater than 90% of GzmA/B+ cells are T cells, either TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> or TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). We conclude that the major expressers of both GzmA and GzmB in the SI are IEL.</p><p id="P10">Since IEL constitutively express Gzms, we first determined whether loss of Gzms affected IEL homeostasis. Total IEL and all subsets were present at similar numbers to wild-type (WT) mice in <italic>GzmA<sup>-/-</sup>/GzmB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (GzmA/B dKO), <italic>GzmA<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (GzmA KO) <italic>GzmB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (GzmB KO) SI epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>). Further, expression of key surface proteins that regulate IEL tissue residency (CD103, CD69), as well as recently described inhibitory receptors (CD160, LAG3, LILRB4, TIGIT, CD96) were all expressed comparably in GzmA/B dKO mice and WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1C</xref>). IEL are highly motile cells that exhibit patrolling immunosurveillance of the gut epithelium, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. As Gzms can cleave ECM proteins, it is possible that IEL require Gzms to move efficiently within the epithelial layer. To test this, we utilized co-cultures of IEL with 3D intestinal epithelial organoids. The movement of WT and dKO IEL was tracked within the epithelial layer of co-cultures. IEL were indeed motile, with a velocity of ~30nm.s<sup>-1</sup>, and both WT and GzmA/B dKO IEL moved at a similar speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. videos 1 and 2</xref>). However, in the absence of GzmA/B, IEL were no longer able to kill a target cell line, K562, upon anti-CD3-mediated TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Thus, except for an inability to kill target cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, GzmA/B dKO IEL appear to be functionally and phenotypically normal in uninfected mice.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IEL-derived granzymes protect the intestinal epithelium against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection</title><p id="P11">Since IEL are the major cell type expressing GzmA and GzmB constitutively in the mouse, we could use GzmA/B dKO to address the function of IEL-derived Gzms in intestinal infection. We infected GzmA/B dKO mice with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium strain SL1344 expressing GFP either orally or intravenously. We focused on mechanisms invoked during infection of the small intestinal epithelium, where IEL are present at high numbers. Hence, we chose not to pre-treat the mice with Streptomycin before infection, as Streptomycin pre-treatment increases <italic>S</italic>.Tm infection at the cecum and colon by ablating intestinal microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, when we orally gavaged C57BL6/J mice with <italic>Salmonella</italic> (10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (cfu) per mouse), all mice were found to be susceptible to infection, as previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic> cfu were mainly found in the small intestine, but not in the cecum or colon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>). Using this infection model, we found that in the absence of GzmA/B, mice were significantly more susceptible to oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> challenge, the natural route of infection. GzmA/B dKO displayed increased weight loss and higher bacterial loads in their mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). In contrast, absence of GzmA/B did not lead to increased susceptibility towards intravenous <italic>S</italic>.Tm infection, quantified in terms of bacterial burden and weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). Thus, GzmA and B contribute to protection against oral, but not intravenous infection with <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p id="P12"><italic>Salmonella</italic> mainly infects the host by actively invading epithelial cells (IEC), by uptake by M cells or by phagocytic sampling of the intestinal lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Active IEC invasion, but not the other two routes of entry, requires <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III secretion system 1 (TTSS-1), which is encoded by <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). To test whether epithelial invasion is necessary to activate the protective effects of Gzms, we used a ΔSPI1 strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> that can still infect mice through phagocytes. We found no significant difference in the susceptibility of WT and GzmA/B dKO mice to the ΔSPI1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). The levels of infection seen were low, but dKO mice also had low bacterial burdens. In summary, these data indicate that GzmA/B specifically protect small intestinal epithelial cells from <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, showing that the route and site of infection are important factors in the immune response to pathogenesis.</p><p id="P13">To evaluate if IEL were the main cells mediating the protective effects of Gzms against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we adoptively transferred WT or GzmA/B dKO IEL to <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (RAG2 KO) mice. To improve the transfer efficiency and to enhance survival, we first cultured cells for 24h with IL-15 and retinoic acid, as we found that this combination increased the expression of the gut-homing proteins CCR9 and α4β7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2B</xref>) and increased the efficiency of the transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2C</xref>). In a competitive transfer, IEL from either WT or dKO genotypes repopulated the intestinal epithelial compartment of RAG2 KO mice equally efficiently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2D)</xref>. We next individually transferred WT or GzmA/B dKO IEL to different groups of RAG2 KO mice. After 4 weeks to allow the adoptively transferred IEL to sufficiently repopulate the gut, the mice were infected orally with <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Both WT and GzmA/B dKO IEL equivalently repopulated the guts of RAG2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Despite large variability in the experiment, we found that overall, RAG2 KO mice reconstituted with GzmA/B dKO IEL lost more weight and had a higher infection burden than RAG2 KO with WT IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-I</xref>). Moreover, three RAG2 KO that did not receive any IEL had to be culled early due to the severity to the infection, even though other Gzm-expressing innate cells had expanded to fill the epithelial niche in RAG2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2E</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that IEL-derived Gzms are important for protection against intestinal <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Thus, the route of infection and IEL dictate the protective effects of Gzms against oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IEL utilize granzymes to kill infected epithelial cells independent of perforin</title><p id="P14">We next explored the mechanisms by which GzmA/B protect the intestinal epithelium. Gzms can cleave extracellular matrix proteins and epithelial cell junction proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and loss of this activity may affect the intestinal barrier, thus increasing bacterial translocation. However, we did not find any difference in intestinal permeability to a small molecule, FITC-Dextran, in GzmA/B dKO mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>). Both GzmA and GzmB can regulate inflammatory cytokine production, with GzmA in particular activating key innate defense cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF or IL-6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, the levels of cytokines in the plasma of orally infected WT and GzmA/B dKO mice were determined at day 5 post infection. We found that the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the serum of infected GzmA/B dKO mice were mostly increased compared to WT mice, especially IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In intestinal ileal tissue from infected WT and GzmA/B dKO mice, there was no difference in the cytokines induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3B</xref>). We conclude that the cytokine levels in the plasma of infected mice seem to be linked to bacterial burden rather than with the functions of Gzms in activating cytokines.</p><p id="P15">The release of Gzms from intracellular secretory granules occurs through degranulation, which can be detected by the exposure of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1 or CD107) on the surface of degranulating cells. After <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we found that over 40% of WT IEL had degranulated as determined by CD107 surface staining, indicating robust activation of IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, no degranulation was observed in dKO IEL from <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected dKO mice. The inability of GzmAB dKO IEL to degranulate appears to be a cell-intrinsic defect, as <italic>in vitro</italic> after stimulation with phorbol ester PMA and calcium ionophore ionomycin, we find that WT IEL degranulate but GzmA/B dKO IEL do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Because the cytotoxic functions of Gzms are generally perforin-dependent and perforin is a component of cytotoxic granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, we asked whether perforin was required for GzmA/B mediated protection against intestinal infection. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Prf1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (Pfn KO) mice were not more susceptible to oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

These data indicate that IEL utilize Gzms in a degranulation-dependent, but perforin-independent manner to control <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p><p id="P16">To further explore how IEL and Gzms are protecting intestinal epithelial cells against infection, we utilized a cell culture infection system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3C</xref>). MODE-K cells, small intestinal epithelial cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, were first infected with a luciferase-expressing strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (SL1344-lux) for 1h, then any remaining extracellular bacteria were killed using gentamycin. At this point, purified IEL were added, and the growth of intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> was measured at various timepoints using luciferase activity as a readout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3D</xref>). We found that after 24h incubation of infected IEC with WT IEL, there was a marked reduction in <italic>Salmonella</italic> levels. Strikingly, no reduction in intracellular levels of SL1344-lux was seen upon co-culture with GzmA/B dKO IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Next, we investigated whether WT and GzmA/B dKO IEL were killing the infected MODE-K cells, by staining living cells with Crystal Violet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).

However, the contribution of GzmA/B to <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced epithelial pyroptosis is unknown. Since <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection events in the small intestine occur at very low frequencies and are hard to detect, we used FlaTox, an engineered form of flagellin that allows the cytosolic delivery of flagellin.

Significantly fewer dying epithelial cells (PI<sup>+</sup>) were detected in ilea of GzmA/B dKO mice relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). These data, in conjunction with the previous report on the shedding of apoptotic enterocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> indicate that Gzms contribute to epithelial cell death, even when external stimuli such as flagellin or LPS are activating cell-intrinsic death.

Since both Gzms could induce cell death <italic>in vitro</italic>, we wondered if differential death modalities induced by GzmA versus GzmB might be regulating bacterial growth. A recent study showed that Salmonella utilizes nutrients from apoptotic cells to grow, thus benefiting from the induction of epithelial cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In the presence of increased apoptosis, but not other forms of cell death, ileal <italic>Salmonella</italic> burdens were higher after oral infection. Of note, the increased extracellular growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the presence of apoptotic cells was found to be dependent on a metabolic enzyme, <italic>pflB</italic>, a pyruvate formate-lyase, that allows Salmonella to use pyruvate from apoptotic cells as an energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Since GzmB specifically induces apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it is plausible that GzmB-induced epithelial cell apoptosis promotes growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. To test if GzmB-mediated apoptotic nutrients are also an important factor in oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used the competitive infection system as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We used the Δ<italic>pflB</italic> strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in competition with WT <italic>Salmonella</italic> SL1344, to infect WT, GzmA KO and GzmB KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The ratio of WT to Δ<italic>pflB</italic> bacterial counts in tissues after <italic>in vivo</italic> infection normalized to the input ratio (competitive index) was then analyzed in each mouse strain. Intriguingly, in the feces and ileum of GzmA KO mice, WT SL1344 had a strong competitive advantage over Δ<italic>pflB</italic> SL1344, which we attribute to the predominant induction of epithelial apoptosis by GzmB in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>).

Hence, we hypothesized that GzmB-mediated apoptosis is promoting intestinal bacterial growth in the lumen, but not translocation of bacteria across the intestinal barrier. To test this hypothesis, we enumerated bacterial loads in the feces as a measure of intestinal luminal growth. Indeed, we found that there was significantly higher bacterial burden in fecal content of GzmA KO mice as compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). However, in gentamycin-treated ilea of these mice, there were similar bacterial loads, indicating similar bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, in the absence of GzmA, the balance of cell death is tipped towards more GzmB-mediated apoptosis, inducing stronger intestinal luminal growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Overall, we conclude that the balance of cell death induced by the different Gzms provides an extra layer of complexity in the protection of the intestinal epithelium from <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">In this study, we explored the relative contributions of GzmA and GzmB in providing protection against infection at the intestinal barrier. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct protective effect of IEL-derived Gzms in intestinal infection. We find that granzyme-mediated protection was independent of perforin, and was more complex than anticipated, as it appears to depend on the concerted, but not redundant, actions of GzmA and GzmB. We show that IEL respond strongly to intestinal Salmonella infection by degranulation. In the absence of both GzmA and GzmB, IEL no longer degranulate, and are defective in killing infected epithelial cells. Moreover, Gzms may contribute to the expulsion of infected epithelial cells, as LPS-induced intestinal epithelial cell shedding requires perforin-independent activities of both GzmA and GzmB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The observation of fewer cleaved-caspase-3-positive enterocytes in GzmA/B dKO mice relative to WT following TNF exposure, suggests that Gzms may also facilitate cell-intrinsic epithelial apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, we find that the absence of Gzms also reduced the amount of pyroptosis induced by NLRC4 activation in the intestine, suggesting that Gzms aid in epithelial cell-intrinsic responses to pathogen triggers. Thus, in the absence of GzmA and GzmB, reduced epithelial cell expulsion and cell death lead to higher bacterial translocation and systemic infection with <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Surprisingly, we found that in the absence of GzmB alone, mice were less susceptible to infection. This seemingly counter-intuitive finding could be explained by the fact that in the absence of GzmB, GzmA is the predominant granzyme, which drives lytic and possibly inflammatory cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. GzmA-mediated cell death is very effective in controlling epithelial <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). In GzmA KO, induction of epithelial apoptosis by GzmB supports the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the ilea of infected mice. Cell death induced by GzmA (in GzmB KO) did not support the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, consistent with its inability to induce apoptosis of target cells. Despite increased luminal growth in orally infected GzmA KO mice, only a mild increase in systemic bacterial load was observed. Here, predominant GzmB-induced apoptosis is still sufficient to clear local infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and through Casp7 cleavage, mediate extrusion of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, which together limit bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Although we had expected that wildtype <italic>Salmonella</italic> would have a growth advantage over the Δ<italic>PflB</italic> strain in WT mice, we found that both strains grew equivalently in the intestines of WT mice, similar to previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. It is possible that the cell death induced by the synergistic actions of GzmA and GzmB in WT mice is neither apoptotic nor inflammatory, but a combination of multiple cell death pathways that does not release nutrients that can be utilized by <italic>Salmonella. Salmonella</italic> infection itself induces cell-intrinsic apoptosis, pyroptosis, and panoptosis that contribute to protection of the host, but can also be co-opted by <italic>Salmonella</italic> for its own benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that IEL intrinsic Gzms provide another layer of control for the host to optimally control <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection by contributing to multiple cell death pathways and expulsion. This additional layer of Gzm mediated cell death can prevent the evasion of pathogens that have evolved to modulate and benefit from intrinsic cell death pathways.</p><p id="P24">Divergent roles of GzmA and GzmB have been observed previously. In rodent lung filarial infection, GzmB KO mice were more resistant to infection, whereas GzmA KO had increased worm burdens as compared to WT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. These opposite phenotypes were ascribed to the pro-inflammatory functions of GzmA, and the anti-inflammatory functions of GzmB. In addition to infection-induced inflammation, it has been reported that the anti-tumoral advantage observed in mice that do not express GzmB is lost when, additionally, GzmA is absent in GzmA/B dKO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These data support the idea that GzmA and GzmB are not redundant but are rather key modulators of the immune response.</p><p id="P25">The route that pathogens use to infect their hosts has a profound impact on the evolution of the host’s immune adaptation. Evolution of Gzms in particular, show evidence of species-specific adaptation to selection pressures enforced by the diversity of pathogens and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Constitutive expression of Gzms in intraepithelial lymphocytes provides an additional layer of protection against diverse pathogens that target barrier sites.

Luciferase-expressing K562 cells (kind gift of Dr. S. Minguet, Freiburg) were plated at 5x10<sup>3</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plates. 75μg/mL D-firefly luciferin potassium salt (Biosynth) was added to the cells and bioluminescence was measured with a PHERAstar plate reader to establish the bioluminescence baseline. For a maximal cell death (positive control), Triton X-100 was added to K562 cells at a final concentration of 1%. For spontaneous death (negative control), culture medium was added to K562 cells. For the test, WT or GzmA/B dKO IEL that had been cultured overnight in 20ng/mL IL-15 (Peprotech) were added to K562 cells at a 40:1 effector-to-target (E:T) ratio with anti-CD3 (1μg/ml) and incubated for 24h. Bioluminescence was measured as relative light units (RLU).

MODE-K (kind gift of. D. Kaiserlian, Lyon) were seeded overnight (in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine, no antibiotics) and infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. For intracellular growth assessment, bacteria were pre-mixed with CD8α<sup>+</sup> purified IEL (1:10 bacteria-effector ratio), or left untreated, for 15 min and the mix was then added to the MODE-K, for 1h. Cells were washed and treated with 50μg/ml of gentamicin in infection medium to kill off extracellular bacteria for 30 min (90 min time point) and then kept in 12.5μg/ml of gentamicin. At indicated time points, bioluminescence was measured in a PHERAstar plate reader. To assess bacteria extracellular growth in presence of IEL, SL1344-lux were mixed with IEL (1:10 bacteria-effector ratio) and bioluminescence was measured at indicated time point. For assessment of intracellular growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, MODE-K cells were first infected with SL1344-lux (MOI of 10) for 1h, washed and treated with 50μg/ml of gentamicin.

After washing with water, the Crystal Violet was solubilised by adding 200μl/well of methanol. The solubilised Crystal Violet was quantified by reading absorbance at 570nm. The absorbance was normalised to the absorbance in infected MODE-K cells without IEL, to calculate the percentage cell death, using the formula : cell death (%)=100* [Abs(MODE-K<sub>inf</sub>) − Abs(MODE-K<sub>inf+IEL</sub>)/Abs(MODE-K<sub>inf</sub>)].</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Immunofluorescence and imaging</title><p id="P42">Small intestinal tissue from GzmA sKO or GzmB sKO mouse or their WT littermates were flushed once with cold HBSS and once with a room-temperature fixative (2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH=7.4), and small (0.8-1 cm) fragments from jejunum or ileum were excised and incubated at room temperature in 10 ml of fresh fixative for 2-3 hours with slow agitation.
