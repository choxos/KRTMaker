The major endocytic pathway is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which supports the uptake of many diverse cargos including nutrients, signaling molecules, membrane proteins, and pathogens. During CME, a dense coat of proteins self-assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The membrane itself is bent into an Ω-shaped invagination that is eventually pinched off to form a coated vesicle, completing endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The major component of the coat are clathrin triskelia, which comprise three heavy and three light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>). When triskelia are bound to the plasma membrane by adaptor proteins, they form ordered clathrin lattices. The structural flexibility of triskelia allows these lattices to adapt variable ratios of predominantly pentagonal and hexagonal faces, forming both flat and curved geometries.</p><p id="P7">Both geometries have been observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro,</italic> and their structure has been well characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> from a structural biology perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Heuser and Kirchhausen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Morris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pearse, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Takei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ungewickell and Branton, 1981</xref>). However, it remains elusive how clathrin coat formation and membrane bending are temporally and causally related during endocytosis in cells.</p><p id="P8">In EM micrographs, it was observed early on that clathrin lattices can assume many different curvatures in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Heuser, 1980</xref>). Since then, two main models of clathrin coat formation during endocytosis have been put forward. In the <italic>constant area model (CAM)</italic>, clathrin grows to its final surface area as a flat coat, which then becomes continuously more curved until vesicle formation is complete. This model assumes that all the differently curved clathrin structures are endocytic intermediates. Early observations suggested the presence of pentagonal and hexagonal faces in isolated coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kanaseki and Kadota, 1969</xref>). Combined with the observation of flat lattices being enriched in hexagons, it was suggested that the integration of at least 12 pentagonal faces is a prerequisite for the formation of a spherical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Heuser, 1980</xref>). However, this would require extensive lattice remodeling which was deemed thermodynamically and structurally unfavorable and thus unlikely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kirchhausen, 1993</xref>). The <italic>constant curvature model (CCM)</italic> was therefore formulated, which assumes that flat clathrin structures are not endocytic precursors. Instead, it was proposed that the endocytic clathrin coat assumes its final curvature, i.e. the curvature of the vesicle, directly from the start, while continuously growing in surface area over time.</p><p id="P9">The constant curvature model had been prevalent in the field, but was recently challenged by reports that flat clathrin coats can indeed change curvature during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). This has once again boosted interest in clathrin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen and Schmid, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sochacki and Taraska, 2018</xref>). Recent years have seen numerous studies based on diverse methods that did not converge on a common result. Reports supported either the constant area model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>), the constant curvature model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Willy et al., 2021</xref>), a combination of both models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tagiltsev et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>) or the simultaneous existence of both models within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). To conclusively understand this complex process, it would be desirable to directly visualize the three-dimensional nanoscale structure of the endocytic clathrin coat in living cells. Unfortunately, however, to date no method offers the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to do that. Here, we aim to circumvent this limitation by densely sampling the entire endocytic process in fixed cells, and subsequently reconstructing the dynamic information.</p><p id="P10">We developed a superresolution microscopy approach to quantitatively study the three-dimensional (3D) clathrin coat architecture at endocytic sites. We used a novel model fitting framework to extract geometric parameters that allowed us to sort static images of clathrin lattices according to their progression along the endocytic timeline. The inferred endocytic dynamics allowed us to reconstruct the stereotypic remodeling of clathrin during endocytosis at the nanoscale.</p><p id="P11">In summary, we found that a clathrin coat first partially assembles on a flat membrane, and then simultaneously grows in surface area and coat curvature. While initial bending occurs rapidly, it later slows down and endocytic sites are eventually paused in a state of high curvature before vesicle scission. This trend is conserved across cell lines, suggesting it is a common attribute that is not affected by cell type. Based on this data, we developed a new kinetic growth model, the <italic>cooperative curvature model (CoopCM).</italic> It describes coat area growth as addition of clathrin to the lattice edge with a constant rate and assumes that the curvature of the coat increases towards a preferred curvature, driven by the cooperative interplay of clathrin triskelia within the lattice. The CoopCM predicts a fast initial curvature increase that is slowed down progressively as the coat becomes spherical, and shows excellent agreement with experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Quantitative 3D superresolution imaging of clathrin structures</title><p id="P12">Here, we used 3D single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to systematically determine the precise geometry of individual clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. For this, we optimized the sample preparation to label clathrin at endocytic sites as densely as possible using indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibodies against clathrin light and heavy chains, which was crucial to achieve high quality SMLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mund and Ries, 2020</xref>). We then localized sparsely activated single fluorophores by fitting an experimentally derived model of the astigmatic point-spread function using a method we developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This improved the resolution to about 10 nm in x/y and 30 nm in z (based on modal values of the localization precision at 3.9 nm in x/y and 12.5 nm in z, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), and reduced typically observed image distortions. The achieved image quality allowed us to clearly visualize and quantify the 3D clathrin coat shape at different stages of endocytic site maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The large majority of sites were single structures that were well-isolated from each other, and exhibited great structural diversity. In addition, we noted several clusters of closely juxtaposed endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). In the isolated sites, we observe a variety of shapes including flat, curved, dome-shaped and spherical structures of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that endocytosis has been arrested by fixation at different time points during endocytic progression.</p><p id="P14">To quantify size and shape of individual clathrin coats, we used LocMoFit, a computational pipeline based on a maximum-likelihood model fitting framework that we developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). This framework directly fits 3D geometric models to the 3D point cloud of localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>) instead of rendered images, and thereby harnesses the full information contained in the SMLM data, including for instance the localization precision, rather than just spatial coordinates.</p><p id="P15">We describe the clathrin coat as a spherical cap that is defined by a radius <italic>r</italic> and a closing angle <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Our model also accounted for coat thickness, antibody size and blurring due to the localization precision (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Hence, it describes both shallow and highly curved structures equally well. Moreover, because <italic>θ</italic> increases during endocytosis from 0° at flat sites to 180° at complete vesicles, we could use this parameter to sort the individual images according to endocytic progress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The clathrin coat grows in area and becomes more curved during endocytosis</title><p id="P16">We first imaged immunostained clathrin in chemically fixed SK-MEL-2 cells, where we focused on the bottom plasma membrane that was densely covered by endocytic sites. These cells have been extensively studied and are established model cells for clathrin-mediated endocytosis with well-characterized endocytic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>). Using the 3D model fitting pipeline, we determined radius <italic>R</italic>, closing angle <italic>θ</italic>, position and rotation of 1798 endocytic sites from 13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We found that two structural intermediates are enriched, while others are rare and only a small fraction of sites were completely flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Slightly curved sites with <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 70° and strongly curved sites with <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 130° were enriched, indicating that those structural states are more frequently found in cells. We only rarely obtained sites with <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 180°, which would be expected for complete spherical coats, even though fully formed vesicles are found in our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). This indicates that at the time point of scission, the clathrin coat of nascent vesicles is still incomplete at the neck, or that the kinetics of scission are too transient for detection. Deeply invaginated clathrin coated pits could further be sheared off during sample preparation, thus evading our detection. Curvatures <italic>H</italic> = 1/<italic>R</italic> ranged from 0 to 0.022 nm<sup>-1</sup> with a median of 0.011 nm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a median radius of 87 nm, and surface areas ranged from 9,000 nm<sup>2</sup> to 140,000 nm<sup>2</sup> with a median of 54,000 nm<sup>2</sup>. These values agree well with previous measurements of the vesicular coat using EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>), median curvature 0.015 nm<sup>-1</sup>, median surface 54,500 nm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="P17">We then wanted to understand how the clathrin coat geometry changes during endocytosis. To this end, we used the closing angle parameter <italic>θ</italic> to sort endocytic sites relative to each other in time. Irrespective of whether endocytosis follows a constant curvature or constant area model, <italic>θ</italic> monotonically increases from early to late endocytic time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), and can thus be used as unbiased proxy for endocytic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The curvature <italic>H</italic> was strongly correlated with <italic>θ</italic>, indicating that coat curvature increases continuously during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, the surface area increased from 32,000 nm<sup>2</sup> (median of 5% of sites with smallest theta) to 50,000 nm<sup>2</sup> (median of 5% of sites with highest theta). The projected area decreased from 31,000 nm<sup>2</sup> to 13,000 nm<sup>2</sup> (median of 5% of sites with lowest and highest theta respectively), which is in close agreement with previous EM measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>). It is readily obvious that our data are incompatible with the constant curvature model, as the curvature is not constant, but increases monotonically with <italic>θ</italic>. Just as clearly, our data do not support the constant area model, because the coat surface also increases during endocytosis.</p><p id="P19">Almost all data points are part of one continuous point cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating a continuous transition between structural states during endocytosis. We noticed an additional small, disconnected set of data points representing 8.5% of all sites that correspond to endocytic sites with curvatures above 0.016 nm<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>θ</italic> of 80°-180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, and example structures in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). In a control experiment to check whether these are endocytic structures, we selectively analyzed clathrin structures that colocalized with AP-2, a bona fide marker for CME. We did not observe AP-2 in any of the disconnected sites, from which we conclude that they indeed do not belong to CME. These small structures could represent coated vesicles from the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The cooperative curvature model of clathrin coat remodeling</title><p id="P20">Our data clearly showed that clathrin coats grow and become more curved as the plasma membrane gets bent to produce a vesicle. Because the data quantitatively describes all 3D geometries that the endocytic clathrin coat assumes, it allowed us to move towards a mathematical model of clathrin coat formation during endocytosis.</p><p id="P21">Here, we introduce the <italic>Cooperative Curvature Model (CoopCM)</italic>, which describes coat growth based on known structural and dynamical properties of clathrin coats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Firstly, we assume that the clathrin coat starts growing on a flat membrane. While triskelia have been shown to exchange dynamically during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>), net growth of the area <italic>A</italic> occurs via the addition of triskelia at the lattice edge <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> with a constant growth rate <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation 1</xref>). <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>on</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P22">Moreover, we assume that the intrinsic pucker angle of individual triskelia and their interactions in a lattice together translate into an overall preferred curvature <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> of the clathrin coat as a whole. However, the initially flat assembly suggests that this preferred curvature cannot be realized in an immature lattice. We hypothesize that cooperative processes in the coat are required to increase curvature. Coat curvature <italic>H</italic> then increases asymptotically towards <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> at an initial rate <italic>γ</italic>, slowing down towards zero when the preferred curvature is reached (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Equation 2</xref>). <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P23">Choosing a quadratic dependence of the rate of curvature change on curvature is a simple way to represent cooperativity in the lattice, which recently has been demonstrated in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zeno et al., 2021</xref>) and fits our data more accurately than the linear relationship, which would correspond to a less cooperative process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Equation 2</xref> can be solved analytically to yield an expression of the curvature <italic>H</italic> depending on <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">Equation 3</xref>), which can then be fitted to our data. <disp-formula id="FD3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>tanh</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P24">Analogous expressions for other geometric parameters like surface area can be derived straightforwardly.</p><p id="P25">The fit of this CoopCM to the data of curvature <italic>H</italic> in relation to closing angle <italic>θ</italic> shows excellent agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In comparison, the CAM fitted the curvature data slightly worse than the CoopCM, and the constant curvature model agreed poorly with the data. The improved fit of the CoomCM compared to the CAM or CCM is not a result of the additional fitting parameter, as we showed using the Baysian Information Criterion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p><p id="P26">From the curvature fits, we calculated the corresponding curves for surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and the edge length of the clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The edge length decreases monotonically and approaches zero at <italic>θ</italic> = 180°, thereby stopping growth according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation 1</xref>. Both graphs again highlight the very close agreement of the model prediction with the experimental data. From the fit, we determined that invagination occurs when about half of the total coat area has grown (<italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.51), and that the preferred curvature of a clathrin coat is <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.014 nm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a radius of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 72 nm. The model yields nearly identical parameters when surface area or rim length are fitted instead of curvature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), highlighting its robustness.</p><p id="P27">We then decided to test if the observed mode of clathrin remodeling is specific for SK-MEL-2 cells. For this, we analyzed the endocytic clathrin ultrastructure also in U2OS cells and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In these cell lines, just like in SK-MEL-2 cells, the curvature as well as the surface area continuously increase throughout endocytosis. We observe that the preferred curvature of the clathrin coat is smaller in U2OS (<italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.012 nm<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 85 nm) and 3T3 cells (<italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.011 nm<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 89.7 nm) compared to SK-MEL-2 (<italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.014 nm<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 72 nm). This suggests that the average size of vesicles formed in CME is cell line specific. The fraction of the surface area acquired on the flat membrane is very similar for all three cell lines, with U2OS derived sites initiating curvature at <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.52 and 3T3 sites at <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.45 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Taken together, we have shown in several cell lines that clathrin coats neither grow via constant curvature or constant area pathways, but rather first grow flat and then acquire curvature and more surface area simultaneously, with a non-linear mode of curvature generation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Temporal reconstruction of structural dynamics in endocytosis</title><p id="P28">We systematically segment all endocytic sites in the superresolution images, and thereby obtain a large dataset where all endocytic time points are sampled homogenously.

The data slightly deviates from the model in the early phase, and more notably in the very end for pseudotimes close to 1. This potentially indicates that clathrin geometry is influenced by other factors besides the coat itself close to vesicle scission.</p><p id="P32">Because this pseudotime resolved dataset was generated from a large number of endocytic sites in many cells, we effectively generated the average trajectories of how curvature, surface area, projected area and lattice edge change during endocytosis in SK-MEL-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-F</xref>). We observe comparatively few flat clathrin coats. This shows that clathrin lattices are only transiently flat in the beginning of endocytosis, and might represent an energetically unfavorable conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). A fast transitions from a flat to a curved structure could further be mediated independently of clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), e.g. by the action of BAR domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Henne et al., 2010</xref>), or at the base of filopodial projections. We further find comparatively many structures with a curvature of <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 70° and <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 130°, indicating more long-lived endocytic stages. As the surface area is constantly increasing over pseudotime, we assume that the enrichment at <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 130° represents a stalling point, where vesicles are formed by addition of final clathrin triskelia and potentially other factors that enable the recruitment and mechanic function of dynamin during vesicle scission. Similarly, the enrichment at <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 70° could be indicative of further recruitment of regulatory components, potentially supporting a previously suggested endocytic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>). This functional interpretation is supported by the observation of similar peaks in U2OS (at <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 60° and <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 130°) as well as 3T3 cells (at <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 50° and <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 130°).</p><p id="P33">Within the first 10% of pseudotemporal progression, the clathrin coat rapidly acquires shallow curvature of <italic>H</italic> = 0.007 nm<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>R</italic> = 134 nm).

There have been two main competing mechanistic models of how triskelia form a coat: the constant curvature model predicts that the clathrin coat assumes its final curvature directly from the start, while continuously increasing in surface area over time. In contrast, the constant area model predicts that clathrin grows to its final surface area as a flat coat, which then becomes continuously more curved until vesicle formation is complete.</p><p id="P36">Each model is supported by a number of studies, which mostly relied on electron microscopy techniques. Among them, 3D correlative electron tomography yields exquisite 3D endocytic membrane shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>), but can be tedious to extend towards large numbers of cells. Platinum replica electron microscopy offers large fields of view and thus superb throughput, but gives limited 3D resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P37">We reason that the trajectory of clathrin coat assembly during endocytosis could best be determined by systematically imaging large numbers of endocytic sites with high 3D resolution. Therefore, we used SMLM that combines high 3D resolution with high throughput. Although lower than in electron microscopy, the resolution we achieved allowed us to resolve the precise 3D coat ultrastructure of clathrin-coated pits. Importantly, due to the molecular specificity for clathrin, we were able to segment all endocytic sites at the bottom surface of the cells in our images in an unbiased way, thus ensuring homogenous sampling of the structural variety of clathrin coats.</p><p id="P38">We applied a novel maximum-likelihood based fitting framework that we developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), which allows fitting complex geometric models to localization point clouds. Because the fit is applied directly to the localizations, it considers all quantitative parameters of all localizations, most notably localization uncertainty. This results in the precise and reliable quantification of the underlying structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wu, Tschanz &amp; Krupnik et al., 2020</xref>), even when taking linkage error through indirect immunolabeling into account (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P39">We described the clathrin coat as a spherical cap, which matched the large majority of sites very well. Additionally, in our data, we observed that some sites are asymmetric, ellipsoidal, or deformed more irregularly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). We do not currently evaluate this asymmetry. Rather, we introduced rotational symmetry during the averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), where we aligned each site based on their model parameters and thus averaged out many irregularities. A deviation of the cross-sectional profile from a circle is nevertheless preserved in the averaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8D - F</xref>), and in future studies more complex geometric models will enable analyzing the structure and asymmetries of the coat in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Flat clathrin-coated structures</title><p id="P40">In the first step of our analysis pipeline, we segmented all clathrin-coated structures in the superresolution images. We thereby aimed to achieve homogenous sampling to capture all endocytic intermediates with the same probability irrespective of time point, size, and orientation. Interestingly, the surfaces of the earliest detectable endocytic sites already contained half the surface area of sites in the latest CME stages. How do these earliest sites assemble? We cannot sort the very flat sites, which are comparatively rare in our dataset, in time using <italic>θ</italic> because their is <italic>θ</italic> close to zero. However, their relative fraction among all sites is still informative. As short-lived states are under-represented, the relative absence of small flat sites in our data indicates that the initial assembly occurs rapidly.</p><p id="P41">In addition to the short lifetimes of small flat sites, two technical reasons could potentially contribute to their rare occurrence in our data. Due to their small size and potentially sub-stoichiometric labeling, which is also noticeable as holes in larger structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), they might not have sufficient immunostaining signal and thus they might be hard to be differentiated from small clusters of primary and secondary antibodies that are routinely observed in SMLM images. Additionally, the very first small clathrin assemblies might be meta-stable, with mostly loosely bound triskelia, and thus might not be stabilized well by chemical fixation. However, it is important to note that very small sites are also rarely found in previously published electron microscopy datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>). Since EM should not suffer from the same technical limitations, it seems likely that these states are indeed short-lived.</p><p id="P42">Generally, completely flat clathrin coats are rare in our data. Instead, we observed that clathrin coats quickly acquire curvature already early in endocytosis. This agrees with the early observation made using EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Heuser, 1980</xref>) that even flat structures already had some small degree of curvature. Interestingly, an enrichment of pentagons was observed towards the edges of flat lattices, leading to the hypothesis that even without additional formation of pentagons these flat lattices have the built-in capacity to become curved, and are not very stable. This notion is in agreement with recent demonstrations that flat clathrin coats store energy, which can drive coat bending without additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tagiltsev et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P43">The importance of curvature generation for clathrin coat maturation is supported by previous studies that suggest failure to initiate significant curvature as a hallmark of abortive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).

This was crucial to precisely measure the clathrin curvature throughout the endocytic timeline ranging from flat to highly curved structures. Especially shallow curvatures are hard to accurately assess with 2D imaging. Thus, our data enabled us to robustly test different growth models for clathrin during endocytosis.</p><p id="P45">The constant curvature model predicts a continuous increase in surface area, constant coat curvature, as well as a rim length that increases until a half spherical geometry is reached, and then decreases again. Our experimental data, most notably the increase in curvature and monotonical decrease in rim length, are incompatible with these predictions, thus ruling out the constant curvature model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, green lines).</p><p id="P46">The constant area model, in a strict interpretation, on the other hand predicts the coat to assemble completely on a flat membrane, after which its area stays constant and only curvature increases to form a spherical vesicle. These predictions agree reasonably well with the data for curvature propagation during CME, but fail to explain the monotonic increase in coat surface over time. Thus, the continuous increase of surface area that we observed here rule out the constant area model as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, blue lines). Interestingly, earlier work compatible with the constant area model already suggested the presence of shallow curvatures in even the flattest clathrin coated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Heuser, 1980</xref>)</p><p id="P47">We found that around half of the clathrin coat area has preassembled when plasma membrane invagination begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), agreeing well with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Scott et al., 2018</xref>), after which the coat keeps growing gradually. Based on this observation, we developed a mathematical model that for the first time considers that curvature is generated in a positive (non-linear) feedback loop. Our cooperative curvature model assumes that net area growth of the clathrin coat occurs via triskelia addition to the many available binding sites at the coat edge. We proposed that this process depends on the number of free binding sites, which scale with the rim length, and can be described by a single kinetic constant <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>. Triskelia addition within the coat is still likely to occur at a lower rate, as clathrin lattices can be unsaturated and have defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Frey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>) and triskelia can exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>), which is energetically favorable for curvature changes within these lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Frey and Schwarz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tagiltsev et al., 2021</xref>). While growth at the rim accounts for increase in surface area, curvature is most likely generated in the bulk of the coat. Here we assumed a non-linear relation between the rate of curvature increase and curvature, which reflects cooperativity in the lattice, e.g. due to rearrangements of neighboring triskelia or larger regions thereof. This assumption of cooperativity is supported by recent experiments, which suggest clathrin to exhibit curvature sensing properties, preferentially assembling at pre-bent membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zeno et al., 2021</xref>). The model described above shows an excellent fit between theory and experiment, and further predicts a square root dependence of theta over time. This describes curvature generation during clathrin coat maturation as a non-linear mechanism driven by a positive feedback of multiple triskelia, slowing down once the coat approaches a preferred degree of curvature.</p><p id="P48">Even though our model agrees very well with the data, it still exhibits certain limitations worth mentioning:</p><p id="P49">Firstly, it only considers the coat itself and ignores the plethora of other proteins within the endocytic machinery. These include numerous BAR domain proteins that are dynamically recruited and disassembled during endocytosis and thus are bound to influence membrane curvature at endocytic sites, as well as a variety of clathrin adaptor proteins, whose presence or absence could explain the cell-type specific differences in average vesicle sizes that we observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these factors could explain the imperfection of our model in the very beginning, and the final part of the timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), where vesicle scission is driven by the fast-acting mechanoenzyme dynamin. Additionally, we only modeled clathrin recruitment and ignore clathrin disassembly, which could be mediated by adaptor unbinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) and uncoating factors including auxilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">He et al., 2020</xref>) that are recruited before the end of vesicle scission. We also assumed that the clathrin coat has constant properties, most notably that the intrinsic coat-driven curvature generation towards its preferred curvature occurs unidirectionally and remains the same throughout endocytosis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">equation 3</xref>). It is however likely that the properties of the clathrin coat change during endocytosis, e.g. by coat stiffening or increasingly tight interactions between triskelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Frey and Schwarz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Frey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Secondly, we reconstructed an average trajectory of clathrin coat remodeling, generated from many individual static snapshots, thereby averaging conceivable different pathways of CME. However, different pathways with substantially changed relationships between the parameters like curvature and theta would be visible in the corresponding plots as separate point clouds. This is not the case, rather we observed a continuous correlation between curvature and theta following a single trajectory, indicating that CME follows a single, stereotypic pathway. We did identify a small, disconnected population of sites in our data set that most likely originate from a distinct cellular mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">4</xref>). While this indicates that our approach should capture potentially different pathways of clathrin coated vesicle formation, we cannot exclude that minor mechanistic variations are included into the average trajectory.</p><p id="P51">Clathrin recruitment has been quantified extensively using live-cell microscopy, resolving the sequential recruitment and dynamic characteristics of many important endocytic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mettlen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schöneberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). We wondered if it is possible to correlate our pseudotime reconstruction with previously reported real-time dynamics of clathrin, which shows an initial fluorescence intensity increase, a plateau, and finally a sharp intensity decrease after vesicle scission. While we observed a correlation between the number of clathrin localizations and surface area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), we note that indirect immunolabeling is not always quantitative, which complicates a direct comparison of previously reported live-cell fluorescence intensity over time and our pseudotime trajectory data. Nevertheless, we speculate that the initial fast intensity increase in live-cell studies likely corresponds to the initial growth of the flat clathrin coat that escapes our detection due to the fast dynamics and small size. The slower fluorescence increase and subsequent plateauing then coincides with curvature generation and final addition of triskelia at the coat rim as resolved in detail in our pseudotime data. To better understand the correlation between changes in the nanoscale architecture of clathrin coats and dynamic consequences, we would ultimately require a method that combines high structural with temporal resolution. In a recent publication, this was attempted using a live-cell 2D superresolution microscopy approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Willy et al., 2021</xref>). This study reported an increasing projected area of clathrin over time, suggested that curvature is present in the earliest detectable clathrin structures, and concluded that CME follows the constant curvature model. Although we also find that completely flat structures are rare and curvature is initiated before the final surface is acquired, our data is entirely incompatible with the CCM. This is especially true in the first half of endocytosis with shallow but progressively increasing curvatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which is challenging to measure using 2D imaging. This shows that it remains highly desirable to ultimately image the 3D nanoscale architecture of the clathrin coat in living cells in real time.</p><p id="P52">In summary, we characterized the dynamics and geometries of the clathrin coat in endocytosis by combining 3D superresolution microscopy, quantitative analysis, and mathematical modeling. We found that clathrin bending and assembly occur simultaneously along a precisely defined trajectory.

Fluorescence emission was filtered using a 676/37 or a 700/100 bandpass filter (AHF) and recorded by an EMCCD camera (Evolve512D; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). Typically, 100,000–300,000 frames were acquired using 15-ms or 30 ms exposure times and laser power densities of ˜15 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. 405-nm laser intensity was adjusted automatically by changing pulse duration in order to keep the number of localizations per frame constant during the acquisition.</p><p id="P59">For the analysis of the disconnected population of sites, one diffraction limited image was additionally acquired before SMLM imaging. For this, a 488 laser at 1.4 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> was used to take a single frame at 30 ms exposure time. Emission was filtered using a 525/50 bandpass filter (AHF).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P60">All data analysis was conducted in SMAP ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ries, 2020</xref>) based on MATLAB and available as open source under github.com/jries/SMAP).</p><sec id="S16"><title>Superresolution image reconstruction</title><p id="P61">For fitting the localizations, peaks were detected as maxima in raw camera images after applying a difference-of-Gaussian filter. At those positions, cropped images of 13x13 pixels were fitted with an experimentally derived PSF model (free fitting parameters: <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>, photons per localization, background per pixel), using an MLE (Maximum likelihood estimation) fitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> positions were corrected for residual drift by a custom algorithm based on redundant cross-correlation. In short, the data was distributed into 10 time bins of equal length. For each bin a superresolution image was reconstructed. We then calculated the image cross-correlations among all superresolution images and extracted the relative displacements in x and y were from the position of the maximum in the cross-correlation images. We then calculated the drift trajectory that best describes the relative displacements. In a second step, the z-drift was measured in an analogous way, using intensity profiles in z instead of images. Localizations persistent over consecutive frames (detected within 35 nm from one another and with a maximum gap of one dark frame) were merged into one localization by calculating the weighted average of <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> positions and the sums of photons per localization and background. Localizations were filtered by the localization precision in x,y (0–20 nm) and z (0-30 nm) to exclude dim localizations. The modal value for the localization precision σ was 3.9 nm in x/y and 12.5 nm in z, leading to a resolution estimate (calculated using the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) using FWHM =2√(2<italic>ln</italic>2)<italic>σ</italic>) of 9.2 nm in x/y and 29.4 nm in z (typical values based on representative image). Superresolution images were constructed with every localization rendered as a two-dimensional spherical Gaussian with a width of 3 nm. The red hot color map used represents the density of localizations, and is scaled in a way that 0.03% of the pixel values are saturated.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Quantitative geometric analysis of clathrin-coated structures</title><p id="P62">Clathrin-coated structures were segmented semi-automatically. First, we manually defined a region of interest excluding the edges of the cell. Then, the image was blurred using a Gaussian filter with a sigma of 100 nm, and peaks were detected using a manually set threshold. This typically yielded several hundreds of sites in a region of 30x30 μm. These candidate sites were curated manually, and only single, well-isolated clathrin-coated structures were retained in the dataset.</p><p id="P63">Next, these structures were analyzed using LocMoFit, an MLE-based model fitting framework that we developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). LocMoFit directly fits localization coordinates with the probability density function (PDF) of a parametrized geometric model. In this study, we modeled clathrin-coated structures with a hollow spherical cap parameterized by the surface <italic>A</italic> area and the closing angle <italic>θ</italic>. <italic>θ</italic> is defined as the angle between the two vectors that point to the pole and to the rim, respectively, from the center of the sphere. The position of the model is defined as the center of mass of the cap. In practice, we discretized the cap by placing spiral points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Saff and Kuijlaars, 1997</xref>), or the spherical Fibonacci lattice, on the surface of the cap to approximate an even distribution. In LocMoFit, these points were treated as discrete fluorophore coordinates when constructing the PDF of the model. During fitting, additional parameters including the center position and the orientation of the model were determined with respect to the fluorophore coordinates, and an extra uncertainty and the background weight were applied to the PDF. After fitting, the sphere radius is derived as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>cos</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, projected area as <italic>A<sub>p</sub></italic> = <italic>π</italic> sin<sup>2</sup><italic>π</italic> <italic>θ</italic> and edge length as <italic>ε</italic> = 2sin. For some flat sites where the fit produced slightly negative curvature values, curvature H and <italic>θ</italic> were set to 0 nm<sup>-1</sup> and 0° respectively in order to approximate them as completely flat.</p><p id="P64">After model fitting, a second curation step was performed. With this we ensured that only well fitted sites are included in the final data set. Sites were excluded if they were upside down (clearly originating from an upper membrane), double-sites with two sites clearly connected to each other or an adjacent flat structure, large plaques or structures non-distinguishable from an antibody cluster.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of clathrin remodeling during endocytosis</title><p id="P65">To sort endocytic sites in pseudotime, they were sorted by the closing angle <italic>θ</italic>, assigning each site a rank index. Flat sites with a manually assigned H = 0 nm<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>θ</italic> = 0 were all assigned an index of 0. As pseudo-temporal sorting assumes that all sites are part of the same endocytic trajectory, endocytic sites with curvatures above a cell line specific threshold (<italic>H</italic> &gt; 0.016 nm<sup>-1</sup> for SK-MEL-2; H &gt; 0.013 nm<sup>-1</sup> for U2OS; H &gt; 0.014 nm<sup>-1</sup> for 3T3) that form a visibly disconnected point cloud (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">4</xref>) were excluded for this analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). To compute pseudo-temporal averages, the sites were spatially and rotationally aligned, and rescaled by the average radius of all sites within the respective bin. Because the geometric model is rotationally symmetric, we then performed rotational averaging by generating 72 duplicates of each structure, rotating them by 5 degrees with respect to each other, and averaging them. The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary movie</xref> was computed using a sliding window approach, where each frame shows the average of 30 sites, and the frame-to-frame increment is 20 sites.

The realistic simulations were based on a two-state (bright and dark) fluorophore model plus bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sage et al., 2019</xref>) and parameters (number of photons, background photons, and fluorophore on-time <italic>t<sub>l</sub></italic>) extracted from our experiment. (1) First, we defined an equally distributed closing angle <italic>θ</italic> from 0 to 180° and calculated the surface area <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) = 2π(1 – cosθ)/<italic>H</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>)<sup>2</sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref> for details).

(2) With the defined model parameters, we generated protein positions for each simulated structure by taking randomly drawn <italic>N</italic> ∝ <italic>A</italic> samples from the PDF of the hollow spherical cap with no uncertainty. (3) With a probability <italic>p</italic><sub>label</sub> = 0.6, a fluorescent label was created at a protein position. (4) Linkage displacements in x, y and z were added to a label and were determined as normally distributed random variables with a variance corresponding to the linkage error of 5 nm. The fluorophore is assumed to be freely rotating three-dimensionally between different blinks. (5) Each fluorophore appeared at a random time and lived for a time <italic>t<sub>l</sub></italic>, determined as a random variable from an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.6 frames. (6) A label had a probability <italic>p</italic><sub>react</sub> = .5 to be reactivated and then appeared at a random later time point, otherwise it was bleached. (7) When it was on, a fluorophore had a constant brightness. Thus, the brightness in each frame was proportional to the fraction of the time the fluorophore was on in each frame. (8) The emitted photons in each frame were determined as a random Poisson variable with a mean value corresponding to the average brightness in the frame. (9) For each frame, we calculated the CRLB (Cramér-Rao lower bound) in x, y and z from the number of photons (with a mean of 11,000) and the background photons (130 per pixel) based on the theoretical Gaussian PSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>) or a 3D cspline PSF model derived from beads calibrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This error was added to the true x, y and z positions of the fluorophores as normally distributed random values with a variance corresponding to the respective calculated CRLB.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Movie 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS145921-supplement-Supplementary_Movie_1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d8aAeEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS145921-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAeEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the entire Ries and Kaksonen labs for fruitful discussions and support.
