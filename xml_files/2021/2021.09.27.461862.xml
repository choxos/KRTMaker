<abstract>
<p id="P1">Although the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination has been studied extensively at the polyclonal level using immune sera, little has been reported on the antibody response at the monoclonal level. Here we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that despite a relatively low serum neutralization titre, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2) were obtained. The vaccine elicited neutralizing mAbs form 8 distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222 elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1-2 months post infection. Spike reactive IgG+ B cells were still detectable 9-months post boost. These findings give molecular insights into AZD1222 elicited antibody response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The SARS-CoV-2 encoded Spike glycoprotein is the key target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) generated in response to natural infection. The Spike trimer consists of two subunits, S1, that is required for interaction with the ACE-2 receptor on target cells, and S2 that orchestrates membrane fusion. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals allowing identification of key neutralizing epitopes on Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andreano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brouwer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Piccoli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Robbiani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Seydoux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tortorici et al., 2020</xref>). Neutralizing epitopes are present on the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spike and S2. RBD-specific nAbs tend to be potently neutralizing and target four epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yuan et al., 2020b</xref>), including the receptor binding motif (RBM) which interacts directly with the ACE-2 receptor. Furthermore, several non-overlapping neutralizing epitopes on NTD have been identified which are susceptible to sequence variation in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cerutti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Suryadevara et al., 2021</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection also generates a large proportion of non-neutralizing antibodies of which the biological function is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beaudoin-Bussières, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Combined, studying the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has generated an antigenic map of the Spike surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Corti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, vaccines against COVID-19 have been rapidly developed. Most licenced vaccines use, or encode, a SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen to elicit both humoral and cellular responses and many have shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Baden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Polack et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Voysey et al., 2021</xref>). However, there are concerns that vaccine efficacy could be reduced against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), in particular against the alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants which harbour mutations throughout Spike. Serum neutralizing activity against viral variants has been reported in many double vaccinated individuals, albeit at a reduced potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Monin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Supasa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhou and al, 2021</xref>). Despite this reduction, real-world data shows current COVID-19 vaccines are still highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations in locations where SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Emary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lopez Bernal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Madhi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Whilst the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination has been studied extensively at the polyclonal level using immune sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Emary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Monin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Supasa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhou and al, 2021</xref>), little has been reported on the antibody response at the monoclonal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amanat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andreano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cho, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>). To address this paucity of information, we isolated a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual (VA14) who had received 2-doses of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine at a 12-week interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The AZD1222 vaccine is a replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ramasamy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Voysey et al., 2021</xref>). Even though low serum neutralization titres (ID<sub>50</sub> ~100) were detected in VA14 at 4-months post vaccine booster, nAbs were isolated which displayed potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants of concern (IC<sub>50</sub> values as low as 0.003 μg/mL). The AZD1222 vaccine elicited NTD- and RBD-specific nAbs that bind epitopes overlapping with nAbs generated following natural infection. Assessment at 9-months post vaccine booster revealed the presence of Spike reactive IgG+ B cells despite undetectable neutralization. These data suggest that although plasma neutralization may be sub-optimal for protection from infection, memory B cells may be sufficient to provide rapid recall responses to protect from serious illness/hospitalizations upon re-infection.</p>

<title>Serum neutralizing activity following AZD1222 vaccination</title>
<p id="P5">Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from donor VA14 (23 years, white male) at 4-months (timepoint 1, TP1) and 9-months (timepoint 2, TP2) after receiving two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine at a 12-week interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). VA14 reported no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on regular PCR testing), did not have N-specific IgG in their plasma at the time of sampling, and was therefore presumed to be SARS-CoV-2 naïve. Presence of IgG to Spike was determined by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and a semi-quantitative ELISA measured 0.39 and 0.17 μg/mL of Spike IgG at TP1 and TP2, respectively.</p>
<p id="P6">Plasma neutralizing activity was measured using an HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type-1)-based virus particles, pseudotyped with Spikes of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including AZD1222 matched Spike (Wuhan-1, WT), and VOCs B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, and a HeLa cell-line stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Seow et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, neutralization titres at 4-months post vaccine boost (TP1) were low. ID<sub>50</sub>s of ~100 were measured against WT and P.1 but were reduced against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although weak binding to Spike was observed at TP2, neutralization was not detected at a serum dilution of 1:20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Spike reactive B cells detected up to one year following AZD1222 vaccination</title>
<p id="P7">Next, we determined the percentage of RBD or Spike reactive IgG expressing B cells at 4- and 9-months post vaccine booster using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-D</xref>). 0.25% of IgG+ B cells were Spike reactive and 0.06% were RBD reactive at 4-months post vaccine booster. Despite the undetectable neutralization by sera at 9-months post vaccine booster, 0.27% of IgG+ B cells were Spike reactive.</p>

<title>AZD1222 vaccination elicits antibodies targeting epitopes on NTD, RBD, S2 and Spike</title>
<p id="P8">RBD or Spike reactive B cells at 4-months post vaccine booster were sorted into individual wells and the antibody heavy and light chain genes rescued by reverse transcription followed by nested PCR using gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). Variable regions were ligated into IgG1 heavy and light chain expression vectors using Gibson assembly and directly transfected into HEK 293T/17 cells. Crude supernatants containing IgG were used to confirm specificity to Spike and the variable heavy and light regions of Spike reactive mAbs were sequenced. In total, 44 Spike reactive mAbs were isolated from VA14.</p>
<p id="P9">Binding to Spike, S1, RBD, NTD and S2 was determined by ELISA and used to identify the domain-specificity of each mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of the 40 mAbs isolated using the stabilized Spike sorting antigen, 45% (18/40) bound RBD, 35% (14/40) bound NTD, 17.5% (7/40) bound S2 and 2.5% (1/40) bound Spike only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). A further four RBD specific mAbs were isolated using the RBD sorting probe. A similar distribution between mAbs targeting RBD, NTD and S2 was seen for mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 6-8 weeks post onset of symptoms (POS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>AZD1222 vaccination elicits neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies against epitopes across the full Spike</title>
<p id="P10">Neutralizing activity of mAbs was initially measured using HIV-1 virus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike encoded by the AZD1222 vaccine. Twenty six of 44 mAbs (59.1%) displayed neutralizing activity of which 21/26 (80.8%) were RBD-specific, 4/26 (15.5%) were NTD-specific and 1/26 (3.8%) only bound Spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). None of the S2-specific nAbs showed neutralizing activity. 95.5% of RBD-specific mAbs and 38.6% of NTD-specific mAbs had neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Neutralization potency against wild-type Spike ranged from 0.025 – 7.3 μg/mL. As previously reported for natural infection, RBD-specific nAbs had a lower geometric mean IC<sub>50</sub> compared to NTD-specific nAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>AZD1222 elicited mAbs are more highly mutated than mAbs from natural infection</title>
<p id="P11">The heavy and light chain variable regions of Spike reactive mAbs were sequenced and the germline usage and level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) determined using IMGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brochet et al., 2008</xref>). An average 4.9% and 2.8% divergence from V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> germlines was observed at the nucleotide level for AZD1222 elicited mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), which is higher than mAbs isolated in our previous study from convalescent individuals 3-8 weeks post onset of symptoms (1.9% and 1.4% for V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). Three pairs of related clones were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Germline gene usage and divergence from germline of both neutralizing and non-neutralizing AZD1222 mAbs were compared to a database of SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs isolated from convalescent individuals (n = 1292) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raybould et al., 2021</xref>) as well as paired heavy and light chains of IgG B cell receptors (BCR) from blood of CD19+ B cells from healthy individuals representative of circulating IgG expressing B cell repertoire (n = 862) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Siu, 2021</xref>). As the SARS-CoV-2 mAb database only included amino acid sequences for some mAbs, divergence from germline was determined at the amino acid level (which correlated well with nucleotide divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>)). AZD1222 elicited mAbs from donor VA14 had a statistically higher amino acid mutation (V<sub>H</sub> 9.2% and V<sub>L</sub> 6.1%) compared to mAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors (V<sub>H</sub> 4.2% and V<sub>L</sub> 3.0%) but had a similar level to B cell receptors from healthy subjects (V<sub>H</sub> 10.9% and V<sub>L</sub> 8.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>).

<title>AZD1222 elicited nAbs bind epitopes overlapping with nAbs generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P14">To gain insight into the epitopes targeted by the AZD1222 elicited nAbs, competition ELISAs with trimeric Spike and previously characterized nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were performed. The panel of competing antibodies encompassed four RBD-, two NTD- and 1 Spike-only competition groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-B</xref>). Additionally, the ability of nAbs to inhibit the interaction between Spike and the ACE2 receptor was determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Four RBD neutralizing antibody classes have been previously identified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yuan et al., 2020b</xref>). nAbs that neutralize by binding to the receptor binding motif (RBM) (equivalent to RBD Class 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yuan et al., 2020a</xref>) commonly use the VH3-53 or VH3-66 germ lines. As expected, the three VH3-53/VH3-66 VA14 nAbs competed with the Group 3 (RBD Class 1) infection nAbs as well as competing strongly for ACE-2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Group 3 nAbs were most potent at neutralizing the matched vaccine strain (Wuhan-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">The majority of RBD-specific nAbs isolated from VA14 (13/20) competed with the Group 4 (RBD Class 3) RBD infection nAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and included both potent and modest neutralizing Abs with varying degrees of ACE2 competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Five VA14 nAbs competed with Group 1 (RBD Class 4) RBD infection nAbs and showed a wide range of potencies and levels of ACE2 competition.

<title>AZD1222 elicited nAbs cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern</title>
<p id="P19">Assessing the cross-neutralizing activity of nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors has revealed that Spike mutations in VOCs selectively hinder neutralizing activity of specific nAb classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wibmer et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we measured the neutralization potency of AZD1222 elicited nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta) and P.1 (gamma) and compared this to nAbs isolated following natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). Spike proteins from these VOCs encode mutations in RBD, NTD and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Some RBD mutations are shared between multiple variants, e.g. B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 all share an N501Y mutation, and P.1 and B.1.351 share an E484K mutation and a mutation at K417. In contrast, NTD mutations vary considerably between VOCs and include both amino acid mutations and deletions. Although a reduction in neutralization potency was observed for some AZD1222 nAbs, RBD- and NTD-specific nAbs with potent cross-neutralization against all VOCs were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B&amp;C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">All Group 3, several Group 4 (VA14_33, VA14_36, VA14R_38) and one Group 1 (VA14R_39) RBD-specific nAbs potently neutralized all five variants at IC<sub>50</sub>s below 0.09 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Several nAbs showed enhanced neutralization of VOCs compared to wild-type. Comparing nAbs elicited following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>) and vaccination, infection nAbs showed a greater sensitivity to Spike mutations in VOCs. Cross-neutralization of nAbs in RBD Groups 1, 2 and 3 was observed for AZD1222 nAbs, whilst some infection nAbs in these competition groups showed greatly reduced neutralization of VOCs P.1 and B.1.351 which both share the E484K mutation. RBD Group 4 mAbs varied in their neutralization of VOCs. 6/13 nAbs showed cross-neutralizing activity. The remaining 7 showed a &gt;3-fold reduction in neutralization against at least one VOC with neutralizing against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 being most greatly reduced. Despite some RBD nAbs showing a decreased neutralisation against VOCs, binding to variant RBD in ELISA was retained for most nAbs except Group 4 nAbs VA14_19 and VA14_50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>) indicating that binding does not always correlate with neutralization.</p>
<p id="P21">Considering the geometric mean IC<sub>50</sub> values, NTD-specific nAbs were most potent at neutralizing the B.1.1.7 VOC. However, the three NTD-competition groups showed differential sensitivities towards the other four SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). For example, Group 5 NTD nAbs had either reduced or lacked neutralization of P.1 and B.1.617.2, whereas Group 8 NTD nAbs VA14_16 and VA14_68 maintained potent neutralization of B.1.617.2. NTD-specific nAb, VA14_16, had broad reactivity neutralizing all variants with an IC<sub>50</sub> &lt;0.14 μg/mL and is the only cross-neutralizing NTD-specific nAbs reported thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, two NTD-specific mAbs that had shown no neutralizing activity against WT pseudotyped virus, neutralized both B.1.1.7 and P.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The differences in neutralization of VOCs by NTD-specific nAbs were reflected in their binding to S1 of VOCs by ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">The S-only reactive nAbs elicited by vaccination did not neutralize any of the SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the infection elicited S-only nAb retained modest neutralization against P.1 at concentrations up to 47.7 μg/mL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the face of SARS-CoV-2 emerging viral variants will be critical for control of the current pandemic. Here we studied the antibody response to the AZD1222 vaccine administered with a 12-week interval at the monoclonal level. The majority of studies examining immune sera from AZD1222 vaccinated individuals have revealed a lower potency against B.1.1.7 (range 2.2 – 9.0-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Emary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wall et al., 2021</xref>), P.1 (2.9-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>), B.1.351 (range 4.0 – 9.0-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Madhi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>) and B.1.617.2 (range 4.3 – 9.0-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wall et al., 2021</xref>) compared to neutralization of Wuhan or D614G variants. Although VA14 had a low plasma neutralizing activity (ID<sub>50</sub> ~1:100) at 4-months post vaccine booster, 59.1% of Spike reactive mAbs isolated from antigen-reactive B cells had neutralizing activity against the matched vaccine strain, and many of these mAbs displayed potent cross-neutralizing activity against current SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. RBD and NTD were the predominant targets for neutralizing antibodies (80.8% and 15.5% of nAbs, respectively). Importantly, we identified RBD-specific nAbs from each of the four competition groups, and NTD-specific nAbs, that cross-neutralized all VOCs. The polyclonal nature of the nAb response elicited by AZD1222 vaccination will likely help limit full vaccine escape in the face of emerging Spike mutations.</p>
<p id="P25">Competition ELISAs revealed that nAbs elicited by AZD1222 target overlapping epitopes of nAbs elicited from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, despite similar antibody footprints, vaccine elicited nAbs from RBD competition Groups 2 and 3 showed greater neutralization breadth than those elicited from natural infection. This was also apparent for some NTD-specific nAbs. This increased neutralization breadth is likely due to the increased divergence from germline in AZD1222 elicited nAbs (isolated 4-months post booster) compared to nAbs isolated following natural infection (isolated 2 – 8 weeks post onset of symptoms) leading to better tolerance of Spike mutations in VOCs. Indeed, several studies have shown that increased somatic hypermutation enhances neutralization breadth against VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">de Mattos Barbosa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gaebler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Muecksch et al., 2021</xref>). Analysis of the antibody-antigen interaction at the molecular level will give further insight into the specific mechanisms of increased neutralization breadth for AZD1222 elicited nAbs.</p>
<p id="P26">Although Spike reactive mAbs generated following AZD1222 have not previously been reported, several studies report mAbs isolated following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amanat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andreano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cho, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>). Comparison between epitopes targeted by mRNA and AZD1222 elicited nAbs showed a higher proportion of RBM targeted nAbs following mRNA vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andreano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>). A similar enrichment in VH3-53 and VH3-30 germline usage was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andreano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>). Despite differences in the timing of mAb isolation across reported studies, the AZD1222 mAbs identified had a higher level of SHM compared to mRNA elicited mAbs and showed greater cross-neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andreano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2021d</xref>). Possible reasons for these differences include; i) timing of mAb isolation following vaccine booster, ii) timing of vaccine boosters (3-week for mRNA studies vs 12-weeks in this study), iii) a prolonged antigen persistence for ChAdOx vectored Spike, or iv) differences in Spike antigen encoded by each vaccine (in particular, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccines encode Spike with stabilizing mutations and a mutation that prevents S1/S2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>)). Understanding these factors will be important for optimizing vaccine strategies aimed at eliciting the broadest nAb response.</p>
<p id="P27">Plasma was not available to determine the peak neutralizing response in VA14 and therefore the relative decline in neutralization following AZD1222 vaccination. The neutralizing antibody titre was low 4-months post vaccine boost and it is not known if this level would be sufficient to provide sterilizing or near sterilizing immunity. However, the identification of B cells producing antibodies with potent cross-neutralizing activity against non-overlapping epitopes and the presence of Spike+ IgG+ B cells at ~1 year post vaccine prime suggests that a rapid recall response will likely occur which could be sufficient to protect against severe disease and/or hospitalization in the face of VOCs.</p>
<p id="P28">In summary, we show that AZD1222 vaccine administered at a 12-week interval can elicit nAbs with potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that target non-overlapping epitopes on RBD and NTD. Despite undetectable plasma neutralizing activity, Spike reactive IgG+ B cells are detected up to 1-year following initial vaccine priming. These data provide important insights into long-term immunity and protection to SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants.</p>

The ACE2 binding inhibition percentage was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<p id="P45">The heavy and light chain sequences of SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs were examined using IMGT/V-QUEST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest">http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest</ext-link>) to identify the germline usages, percentage of SHM and CDR region lengths. To remove variation introduced through cloning using mixture of forward primers, 5 amino acids or 15 nucleotides were trimmed from the start and end of the translated variable genes. D'Agostino &amp; Pearson normality test, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test, Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test and two-sided binomial tests) were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Significance defined as p &lt; 0.0332 (*), 0.0021 (**), 0.0002 (***) and &gt;0.0001 (****).</p>
