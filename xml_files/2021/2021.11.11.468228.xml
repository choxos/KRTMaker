<abstract>
<p id="P2">In addition to its essential role in viral polyprotein processing, the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like (3CLpro) protease can cleave human immune signaling proteins, like NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) and deregulate the host immune response. Here, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays show that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleaves NEMO with fine-tuned efficiency. Analysis of the 2.14 Å resolution crystal structure of 3CLpro C145S bound to NEMO<sub>226-235</sub> reveals subsites that tolerate a range of viral and host substrates through main chain hydrogen bonds while also enforcing specificity using side chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Machine learning- and physics-based computational methods predict that variation in key binding residues of 3CLpro-NEMO helps explain the high fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. We posit that cleavage of NEMO is an important piece of information to be accounted for in the pathology of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The impacts of the global Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been extremely harsh. As of July 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 187 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 4 million deaths (covid19.who.int/), and the global economy to contract by 3.5% in 2020 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Unlike previous <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> outbreaks, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to every country, which has provided the urgency and impetus to develop and rapidly distribute novel therapeutics to reduce the spread of the virus, including RNA-based vaccines. However, many societal impediments and the emergence of highly fit variants of concern are preventing vaccination coverage from reaching the levels necessary for herd immunity. Therefore, multiple therapeutic approaches will need to be implemented if we are to eventually eradicate SARS-CoV-2 and future zoonotic outbreaks.</p>
<p id="P4">One effective means to inhibit viral transmission and reduce the severity of the disease is to disrupt the lifecycle of the pathogen. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> with a single stranded, positive-sense, 29 kb RNA genome that encodes a number of open reading frames (ORFs). <italic>ORF1a</italic> and <italic>ORF1b</italic> encode the polyproteins that are processed to generate the 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps) of SARS-CoV-2. These include the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which are required to execute the viral life cycle and inhibit the host immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. These proteases therefore represent high-value targets for intervention.</p>
<p id="P5">The Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) is replete with structures of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) 3CLpro <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. 3CLpro WT homodimers are a 67.60 kDa, heart-shaped complex <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Each 3CLpro chain consists of three domains. Domain I (aa. 8-101) and Domain II (aa. 102-184) have a predominantly β-sheet structure, form the active site, and contribute to dimerization. Domain III (aa. 201-303) is substantially α-helical and is the primary determinant of dimerization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. The active site of WT 3CLpro contains a catalytic dyad of His41 and Cys145, and an oxyanion hole formed by the main chain amide groups of Gly143 and Cys145<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. During catalysis, His41 deprotonates the γ-thiol group of Cys145 to generate a nucleophile. Nucleophilic attack at the main chain carbonyl carbon of the P1 residue (immediately preceding the substrate scissile bond) forms a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. Heterolytic fission of the scissile bond stabilizes this intermediate, forms the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and releases the peptide downstream of the scissile bond. Finally, the active site is regenerated as a catalytic water molecule deacylates the acyl-enzyme intermediate.</p>
<p id="P6">Functionally, 3CLpro recognizes a hydrophobic substrate residue at P2 (usually Phe or Leu), a Gln at P1, and Ser, Val, Asn, or Ala residues at P1’. This recognition motif is found in multiple sites of the viral polyproteins, which are cleaved by 3CLpro to form mature nsp5-16. This consensus sequence is also present in proteins of the host innate immune pathway and therefore 3CLpro may blunt the immediate antiviral immune response via proteolysis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> is one of the immune proteins that may be cleaved by 3CLpro. NEMO is necessary for activating NF-κB during the canonical NF-κB response signalling pathway, which is a critical first response to viral infection. A disrupted NF-κB pathway is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory diseases <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, which suggests that hNEMO cleavage by 3CLpro and the downstream dysregulation of NF-κB could contribute to the enhanced inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">The structure of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2 in complex with a NEMO-derived heptapeptide substrate was solved for the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, an <italic>alphacoronavirus</italic> (PDB ID: 5ZQG)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. It is not known if this interaction is conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and other <italic>betacoronaviruses</italic>. In this work, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays showed that WT SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro can cleave the 33-residue peptide substrate, NEMO<sub>215-247</sub>. To explore the molecular basis of this interaction, we solved a 2.14 Å crystal structure of a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro active site cysteine variant, C145S, in complex with the human decapeptide substrate NEMO<sub>226-235</sub>. This represents the first structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that is bound to a human peptide substrate. Using this structure as a starting point, extensive molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics calculations, and machine learning-based predictions indicated that the few differences in NEMO and 3CLpro across host species and human-infecting <italic>betacoronaviruses</italic> significantly change the stability of the complex formed between these proteins. Finally, we discuss how ablation of NEMO via proteolysis connects with COVID-19 as a systemic disease.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 cleaves NEMO</title>
<p id="P8">In prior studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro has been found to disrupt several components of the type I interferon pathway. NEMO has been shown to be cleaved by 3CLPro from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Molecular docking and comparative structural analyses suggest that NEMO similarly binds to SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro in a position that favors proteolysis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Recently, N-terminomics experiments confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> the cleavage of NEMO by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P9">NEMO is known to form a homodimer of two, 419 residue (49 kDa), mostly α-helical protomers <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> and the overall domain architecture is well characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> A primary sequence analysis of NEMO (hNEMO) identifies five likely 3CLpro recognition sites around Gln83, Gln205, Gln231, Gln304, and Gln313, where the listed Gln would act as the P1 residue in each case <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). 3CLpro enzyme was incubated with five constructs of NEMO from mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, (mNEMO; i.e., amino acids 96-250, 221-250, 221-339, GST-96-250, GST-221-250, and GST-221-339), and the products detected by SDS-PAGE were consistent with cleavage following Gln231 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). To assess the ability and efficiency of the main protease to cleave hNEMO, we expressed and purified hNEMO truncated to amino acids 215-247, which mostly contains the Hlx2 domain, where the Gln231 recognition site is located. A previously reported assay was adapted.<sup>

<title>Structure of 3CLpro C145S bound to a NEMO substrate peptide at 2.14 Å resolution</title>
<p id="P10">After extensive co-crystallization trials, we determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro C145S variant in complex with a decapeptide from human NEMO at 2.14 Å resolution. This structure shows the Michaelis-like complex of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro C145S and NEMO poised for catalysis.</p>
<p id="P11">In the NEMO-bound 3CLpro C145S structure, the asymmetric unit contains two, mature, heart-shaped 3CLpro C145S dimers. One dimer forms between chains A and B, and the second dimer forms between chains C and D. Chains B and C are each bound to the NEMO peptide (acetyl-KLAQLQVAYH-amide; aa. 226-235) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Within the asymmetric unit, the C-terminal tail (Ser301-Gln306) of chain A swaps into the substrate-binding site of chain D. This connects the two dimers to each other in the asymmetric unit. Additionally, the substrate-binding site of chain A is bound by the C-terminal tail of chain D from a neighboring symmetry equivalent. This C-terminal tail-binding contributes to crystal lattice formation by connecting chains A and D to each other throughout the crystal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). Finally, while the C-terminal tails of chains A and D are involved in forming the crystal lattice, the C-terminal tails of chains B and C bind at sites found at the interfaces of their respective dimers. Similar C-terminus swapping was reported for the C145A mutant of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. NEMO peptides bind in an extended conformation, similar to an anti-parallel β-sheet with 3CLpro residues Gln189-Ala191 and His163-Pro168. In chains B and C, there is density to model KLAQLQVAY (aa. 226-234) and, the entire peptide, KLAQLQVAYH (aa. 226-235), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), where Lys226 is P6, His235 is P4’, Gln231 is P1 and Val232 is P1’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). The N-acetyl and C-amide caps are not resolved. The densities in the substrate-binding sites of chains B and C can be unequivocally assigned as NEMO, rather than as a C-terminal tail. The densities do not connect to protein chains near the substrate-binding sites, but project into the bulk solvent. The densities in chains B and C are also too long to be assigned as the C-terminal tail, continuing beyond Ser145 in the substrate-binding site (unlike the density for the C-terminal tails in chains A and D). Finally, the positions of all C-terminal tails in the asymmetric unit are accounted for, and the shape of the density in chains B and C around residues P2, P3, P5, and P6 is consistent with the NEMO sequence.</p>

<title>Thr26 and Thr190 of 3CLpro pin the NEMO peptide into 3CLpro</title>
<p id="P12">Thr190 and Thr26 of 3CLpro use hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to pin the ends of the NEMO peptide into the substrate-binding site, causing conformational changes in the site. Thr26 and Thr190 form H-bonds with Ala233 (P2’) and Ala228 of NEMO (P4), respectively. This causes the distance between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of Thr26 and Thr190 to decrease from 21.7 Å (in WT 3CLpro) and 21.3 Å (in 3CLpro C145S without NEMO) to 20.4 Å in the NEMO-bound 3CLpro C145S.</p>

<title>Polar and hydrophobic subsites in 3CLpro position a glutamine at P1 while promoting substrate versatility</title>
<p id="P13">Our structure of 3CLpro C145S bound to a NEMO peptide identifies all the structural sites required for substrate-binding in 3CLpro. The substrate-binding site of 3CLpro consists of a groove made by four groups of consecutive residues, Gln189-Ala191, His163-Pro168, Phe140-Ser145, and Thr24-Leu27, as well as His41 and Met49. Gln189-Ala191 and His163-Pro168 run adjacent to each other, bind the P2-P4 residues of the NEMO peptide and position P1 in the active site. In the active site, Phe140-Ser145 bind P1. Following the active site, Thr24-Leu27 bind the P1’-P4’ residues. His41 is involved in catalysis and Met49 interacts with substrate P2. The subsites in the substrate-binding site of 3CLpro are identified as S4 to S4’, where S4 binds to P4 and S4’ binds to P4’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> indicates that the preference for main chain H-bond interactions with the substrate retains substrate versatility in the S4-S2 and S1’-S4’ subsites. This supports the versatility of 3CLpro in cleaving the viral polyprotein at multiple sites and its activity towards several host proteins <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. There are no S5 and S6 subsites in 3CLpro for P5 and P6 substrate residues, respectively.</p>
<p id="P15">To modulate substrate-selectivity, hydrophobic contacts select for hydrophobic side chains at P4, P2, and occasionally at P1’. Furthermore, in the S1 subsite, main chain interactions from His164 as well as Gly143 and Ser145 of the oxyanion hole combine with side chain interactions from His163 and Glu166 to select for glutamine at P1, position the main chain carbonyl carbon of NEMO Gln231 for the nucleophilic attack during catalysis, and stabilize the tetrahedral anion intermediate. Finally, the side chain of Ser145 forms H-bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Gln231, and Nε2 of His41 (3.0 Å). The H-bond between Cys145 and His41 is crucial in WT 3CLpro to generate the thiolate nucleophile for catalysis.</p>

<label>2.5</label>
<title>Comparison of bound NEMO and C-terminal tails helps clarify substrate-selectivity of 3CLpro</title>
<p id="P16">Comparison of NEMO and C-terminal-binding identifies that the S2 and S4 subsites contribute to substrate versatility in 3CLpro and that the S3 and S1 subsites are highly conserved between substrates. Compared to the C-terminal tail, NEMO forms an additional H-bond with Thr190 in the S4 subsite (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, NEMO forms an additional H-bond and hydrophobic contact with Gln189 and Met165, respectively, in the S2 subsite compared to the C-terminal tail. The S4 and S2 subsites therefore engage extra interactions to bind to NEMO P4 and P2 residues respectively. S3 and S1 subsites share the same interactions and so all the listed interactions are required for substrate-binding in 3CLpro. Finally, C-terminal P2 (Phe305) and P1 (Gln306) form H-bonds with the water 95 (3.0 Å and 2.7 Å respectively). This water is deacylating during 3CLpro catalysis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, 3.3 Å from the C-terminal carboxyl carbon and has a Bürgi-Donitz angle of 122° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). In the NEMO-bound site, it is displaced by a hydrophobic side chain at P1’. Finally, the structure of 3CLpro bound to a C-terminal tail with residues in the S’ sites would identify such interactions in the S1’-S4’ subsites of 3CLpro.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<label>2.6</label>
<title>C-terminal tails bind at two distinct sites of the 3CLpro dimer</title>
<p id="P17">An alternative binding site for the C-terminal tails is found in chains B and C in a groove formed at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). At the dimer interface, the C-terminal tail is sandwiched between the two β-strands from Gly109-Tyr118 and Ser120-Arg131 in the neighboring chain and both the Ser1-Gly11 loop and Asp153-Cys156 turn in the same chain. Specifically, in chain B, the side chain methyl group of Thr304 forms hydrophobic contacts with the side chain of Tyr118 in the neighboring chain A. Finally, the side chain of Phe305 forms hydrophobic contacts with a hydrophobic pocket consisting of the side chains of Phe8, Ile152, Val303, and the side chain propyl moiety of Arg298. It is possible that this interfacial site has a role in positioning substrates and cleavage products prior to and following catalysis, respectively.</p>

<title>Interfacial binding site of C-terminus attenuates self-inhibition of 3CLpro</title>
<p id="P18">In SARS-CoV 3CLpro, residues Arg298 and Gln299 in the C-terminal α-helix are reported to be essential for dimerization and for activity by direct and indirect interactions with the S1 subsite of the neighboring 3CLpro in the dimer <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. In the C-terminal α-helix of the NEMO-bound SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro C145S structure, Arg298 of chain B is closer to the carbonyl oxygen of Met6 when the C-terminal tail is bound at the dimer interface site than when it is bound in the substrate-binding groove. The closest distance of a side chain N in Arg298 from the backbone O in Met6 is 3.8, 3.6, 3.4, and 3.7 Å in chains A, B, C, and D, respectively, indicating tighter packing between the two sites with the C-terminal tail at the dimer interface. In both dimers within the asymmetric unit, this packing of Arg298 and Met6 is supported by a likely cation-π interaction between Arg298 and Phe8 as well as by H-bonds formed by Gln299 with the side chain of Ser139 in the neighboring protomer, chain A, and with the backbone of Arg4 in chain B. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the 3CLpro dimer, using chains A and B, with NEMO bound to the latter, show that these interactions involving Arg298 and Gln299 persist during most of the trajectories except by the pair Arg298-Met6, indicating that other inter-dimeric contacts contribute to stabilizing the non-interfacial conformation of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Finally, estimation of the binding affinity by rigid re-docking of a C-terminus-like peptide (Cys300-Gln306) to the two alternative C-terminal binding sites predicts stronger binding to the catalytic site (-14.5 kcal/mol) compared to the dimer interface (-12.8 kcal/mol) that by far compensates for a weaker Arg298-Met6 interaction. These comparable binding affinities suggest that the interfacial binding site contributes to decreasing self-inhibition of 3CLpro. In line with that and with the NEMO-cleavage detected <italic>in vitro</italic>, the interaction with C-terminal tail at the active groove is less effective compared to NEMO-binding (-19.8 kcal/mol).</p>

The H-bond pair Leu230-Gln189 appears less than 7% of the time. Several other residues in the binding site of 3CLpro form stable contacts with hNEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).

<title>Predicted binding affinity of NEMO to 3CLpro differ among host species and coronaviruses</title>
<p id="P21">The binding core of NEMO is highly conserved among different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), but amongst mammals, the predicted hot spot at P1’ is a Val232 in hNEMO whereas it is an Ala232 in mNEMO and golden hamster (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) NEMO. Next, we carried out other MD simulations for hNEMO<sub>227-234</sub> and mNEMO<sub>227-234</sub>. Like in hNEMO, the distance between the catalytic S<sup>-</sup> in 3CLpro Cys145 and the carbonyl C in mNEMO Gln231 remains near 5.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). However, the simulations show a decrease in the average number of contacts between mNEMO (49 ± 4) and 3CLpro compared to hNEMO (54 ± 4), and the C<sub>α</sub> root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) of mNEMO (1.9 ± 0.6 Å) relative to the initial position is larger than hNEMO (1.4 ± 0.4 Å). The impact of V232A becomes more pronounced in simulations with NEMO<sub>190-270</sub> in the dimeric form, in which we observe large fluctuations in the distance between 3CLpro Cys145 and mNEMO Gln231 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). This is explained by competing interactions within the NEMO dimer. NEMO dimerizes at Hlx2 forming hydrophobic contacts between the pairs of Tyr234, Leu230, and Leu227 in each protomer <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, and Tyr234 forms H-bonds with Glu240 in the neighboring protomer.</p>
<p id="P22">The viral counterpart, 3CLpro, is also highly conserved among species, but structural differences among human-infecting <italic>betacoronaviruses</italic> underpin differences in their predicted interactions with NEMO. Specifically, in HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, the predicted hot spots, Met49, His164, and Met165, are not fully conserved, and the loop/α-helix formed by aa. 41-53 in Domain I of 3CLpro, which skirts the substrate-binding site, harbors most of the other differences. MD simulations of these proteins bound to hNEMO (aa. 227-234) show that 3CLpro from MERS-CoV (43 ± 4) and SARS-CoV (46 ± 7) exhibit lower average number of contacts than SARS-CoV-2 (52 ± 3) and HCoV-HKU1 (53 ± 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Particularly, this corroborates the hypothesis, detailed in the Discussion, that the S46A substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro significantly impacts interactions with NEMO.</p>
<p id="P23">Unsurprisingly, given the proximity of S/A46, the hot spot Met49 is one of the affected contacts. Simulations of these enzymes in the <italic>apo</italic> state show that the aa. 41-53 in 3CLpro exhibit slightly different flexibility, with SARS-CoV 3CLpro displaying a RMS fluctuation of 2.2 and 2.3 Å in each chain of the dimer and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, 2.3 and 2.5 Å. Additionally, essential C<sub>α</sub> cross-correlation analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro dimer has significantly more residue pairs exhibiting synchronized motions along the same or opposite directions than SARS-CoV 3CLpro, which may reflect a tighter dimeric packing (38183 <italic>vs</italic>. 22513 pairs and 35707 <italic>vs</italic>. 17567 pairs, respectively; cutoff is a correlation modulus of 0.85; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Finally, for a quantitative assessment of relative hNEMO-binding affinities, quantum mechanics (QM)- and MD/ML-based predictions were carried out. In the QM calculations, the fragment molecular orbital density-functional tight-binding (FMO-DFTB) method was used. For the MD/ML-based approach, five different models were trained. The rankings from the weakest to the strongest binding enzyme were nearly consistent between the two approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). The exception is the relative position of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. A possible explanation, further explored in Discussion, is that the few differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro affect the conformational flexibility of the binding site, which may be captured in MD/ML but not in the QM approach.</p>

<title>Predicted mechanism of NEMO-binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro</title>
<p id="P25">SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro binds Lys226-His235 of the α-helical Hlx2 domain of one NEMO protomer in an extended conformation. In agreement, QM calculations predict favorable energetics for NEMO-binding to 3CLpro in such an extended conformation. SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro therefore either makes use of a transient partially unwound state of Hlx2 for proteolysis or it actively outcompetes NEMO dimer interactions and unwinds the α-helix of one protomer. Specifically, 3CLpro forms two hydrophobic contacts as well as H-bonds with Leu230. This outcompetes the hydrophobic contacts formed by Leu230 in the NEMO dimer partner. Additionally, 3CLpro forms H-bonds with NEMO His235 and Ala233, either side of Tyr234, outcompeting the H-bond formed between Tyr234 and Glu240 in the NEMO dimer.</p>

<p id="P28">In 7N89, the S5 subsite recruits a water molecule to bind N-terminal P5 (Ser). This is not observed in our NEMO-bound structure. The S4 subsite forms a hydrophobic contact between Met165 and NEMO P4 but not with N-terminal P4 (Ala). This site therefore contributes to the substrate-versatility of 3CLpro. In the S3 subsite, the main chain H-bonds from Glu166 are conserved when binding both substrates. However, 3CLpro recruits an additional hydrophobic contact between the alkyl moiety of Glu166 and N-terminal P3 (Val). The S2 subsite conserves all interactions observed between 3CLpro and NEMO but engages an additional main chain H-bond with water476 that stabilizes N-terminal P2 (Leu) in its subsite. 7N89 identifies extra interactions that strengthen the specificity for Gln P1. In 7N89, the side chain of P1 Gln forms additional H-bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Phe140 and water472. Due to the polar nature of the Ser145 γ-hydroxyl group in 3CLpro C145S, there is an additional observed H-bond with the carbonyl group of Gln P1 in the NEMO-bound structure. The S1’ subsite is flexible. It forms no interactions with the N-terminal substrate but engages hydrophobic contacts from Thr25 and Leu27 side chains to bind NEMO. It therefore contributes to 3CLpro substrate versatility. The S2’ subsite interactions are conserved between NEMO- and N-terminal-bound structures, indicating a requirement for Thr26 peptide-nonspecific main chain interactions at this subsite. Finally, the S3’ and S4’ subsites both contribute to substrate versatility. 3CLpro engages hydrophobic contacts between Met49 and Thr24 to bind N-terminal P3’ (Phe) and NEMO P4’ respectively.</p>

Microseeds were generated from clusters using Seed-Beads (Hampton Research, USA). Single crystals were produced by setting up hanging drop crystallization wells at 18 °C with 10 μL of 3CLpro WT and 10 μL of 1:500 dilution microseeds, using 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-tris propane pH 7.0 and 4 mg/mL 3CLpro WT protein concentration, and 20% PEG 3350/0.1 M Bis-tris pH 6.5, 5 mg/mL 3CLpro WT protein concentration.</p>

<title>3CLpro C145S expression and purification</title>
<p id="P41">BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pMCSG53 pDNA containing a 3CLpro C145S insert (provided by Andrzej Joachimiak) with a TEV-sensitive N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag. Transformation, expression and harvesting was performed as with WT 3CLpro. Initial Ni<sup>2+</sup> column purification was performed as with WT 3CLpro. Elution fractions with highest 3CLpro C145S concentration were combined and dialysed overnight against 2L of dialysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 25 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). 48-hour TEV digestion was initiated by adding 25 ug of TEV per ug of 3CLpro C145S. The solution after cleavage reaction was passed through a second, 6 ml, pre-equilibrated nickel column. The flowthrough from this column was collected and buffer-exchanged using 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrators (EMD Millipore, USA) into crystallization buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT).</p>

<title>Data collection and structural determination and refinement</title>
<p id="P45">Preliminary, cryogenic data collection was carried out at SSRL, using an Eiger X 16M detector, to confirm the presence of protein crystals. Cryogenic, X-ray crystallographic diffraction data of 3CLpro WT, C145S and NEMO-bound C145S was collected on beamline 12-2 at SSRL, using an Eiger X 16M detector. Data were processed using XDS. 3CLpro WT crystallized in the C2 space group, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Both 3CLpro C145S and the NEMO-bound 3CLpro C145S crystallized in the P1 space group with four protomers per asymmetric unit. The 3CLpro WT structure was phased in MOLREP <sup>

<title>Preparation NEMO-bound models of 3CLpro from different betacoronaviruses</title>
<p id="P46">Chains A and B from the crystallographic structure described here were used as the starting configuration for the simulations of the NEMO-bound dimeric SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Along with that, structures of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV (PDB id 5B6O), MERS-CoV (PDB id 5C3N), and HKU1-CoV (PDB id 3D23) were used <sup>

</sup>. After structural alignment, the coordinates from NEMO (aa. 227-234) from the X-ray structure of the NEMO-bound SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro C145S variant were used to build the models of NEMO-bound SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HKU1-CoV 3CLpro dimers. In SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, Val232 was replaced by Ala232 to also study the interactions in the binding site of 3CLpro with mouse NEMO<sub>227-234</sub>.</p>
<p id="P47">The models of complexes of 3CLpro with a long construct of human and mouse NEMO (aa. 190-270) were built prior to solving the crystallographic structure described in this study, so the coordinates of the 7-residue fragment of NEMO (residues 227-233) from the crystallographic structure of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 3CLpro bound to NEMO<sub>227-233</sub> (PDB id 5ZQG) were used. We note that the NEMO-peptide in PEDV 3CLpro has a very similar conformation and position to what was found in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, displaying a NEMO<sub>227-233</sub> C<sub>α</sub>/C<sub>β</sub> RMSD of 0.9 Å between the two structures. NEMO N- and C-termini were capped with acetyl and N-methylamide, respectively.

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations and conformation selection for binding affinity predictions</title>
<p id="P48">Different protocols of simulation were conducted for 3CLpro-NEMO<sub>227-234</sub> and 3CLpro-NEMO<sub>190-270</sub> systems, as the former was used both for traditional MD analysis and to select conformations for binding affinity predictions (Supplementary Methods). For the 3CLpro-NEMO<sub>227-234</sub> systems, which were mostly generated <italic>in silico</italic>, we applied a strategy of MD simulations that aims structural refinement and sampling conformations that visit key interactions. Snapshots selected from these simulations were used as input for machine learningbased binding affinity prediction (MD/ML approach). Similarly to the method of protein structure refinement described in Heo et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>, sampling was accelerated in a controlled manner by applying a fairly high temperature and weak position restraint potentials that compensate for the high thermal energy, which could drastically propagate the effects of any local molecular distortions or bad contacts. The applied position restraints are much weaker than the energy range of typical non-covalent interactions and conformational changes so that sampling is minimally biased while unrealistic states are easily escaped.</p>
<p id="P49">For the MD/ML approach, five independent conformational sampling runs were performed for 224 ns, recording coordinates every 40 ps. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods and Table S4</xref> summarizes this MD-based protocol of sampling for conformation selection. The conformations generated from the restrained MD simulations were grouped via a root-mean-square deviation-based algorithm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. Considering only C<sub>α</sub> atoms of NEMO and residues in the Domains I and II of the <italic>holo</italic> chain of 3CLpro (aa. 16-198), the RMSD of atom-pair distances was computed applying the 1.0 Å cutoff as parameter for clustering. The interaction energy between 3CLpro and the NEMO-peptide was computed using the energy plugin within GROMACS. For each system, three structures with the lowest interaction energy were selected from different conformation clusters within the 20 most populated and used as input for ML-based binding affinity prediction.</p>
<p id="P50">In parallel, for classical molecular dynamics analysis, the equilibration phase was fully performed at 310.15 K and five independent production unrestrained runs of 112 ns were carried out. In the simulations of 3CLpro-NEMO<sub>190-270</sub> systems, five production runs of 116 ns were performed with no position restraints.</p>

<title>Binding affinity from quantum mechanics calculations</title>
<p id="P51">The inclusion of quantum mechanics (QM) or machine learning (ML) in high-throughput drug screening to narrow down the list of promising inhibitor candidates has emerged as a very promising protocol. Recently, we illustrated an encouraging application of QM to refine the binding affinity of classical docking results of COVID-19 spike protein inhibitor drugs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. In this work, we employed a similar strategy to evaluate the binding affinity of NEMO with different 3CLPro targets. For the QM-based prediction, we employed the linear-scaling fragment molecular orbital density-functional tight-binding (FMO-DFTB) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup> method to predict binding affinities of NEMO with the four 3CLPro targets. In addition, the polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used to include solvent effects <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
</sup>. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used to describe interactions with solvent, and the empirical D3 dispersion correction was used to improve the accuracy in describing non-covalent interactions. For the PCM calculations, the cavity was calculated using newly calibrated atomic radii to improve accuracy in predicting solvation free energy of DFTB in an aqueous solvent. The details of the atomic radii optimization will be published elsewhere. For each target, the FMO-DFTB/PCM method was used to re-optimize structures of NEMO model systems in bound and unbound states, while the target’s structure was fixed. Partial re-optimization of the target did not significantly alter the result. The internal binding energy is defined as the difference in internal energy between the complex and its corresponding unbound NEMO and unbound 3CLPro.</p>

<title>Binding affinity from machine learning-based rescoring</title>
<p id="P52">Machine-learned models dedicated to predicting binding affinities (Demerdash, 2021, <italic>in press</italic>) were trained on a large database of protein-small molecule complexes with both experimental binding affinities and X-ray crystal complexes known as PDBBIND <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>, followed by testing on an independent data set, the CASF-2013 benchmark <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>, that was not used in the training. For each complex a set of seven features were calculated, where each feature is itself a predicted affinity or free energy calculated under very different physical assumptions (Supplementary Methods). Models were trained using either support-vector machines, gradient-boosted trees, or random forest. For each of these 3 methods, models were trained using normalized, or scaled, features. For the gradient-boosted tree and random forest method, models were additionally trained on the raw, unscaled features. For each <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> 3CLpro, the models were applied to the energy minimized complexes and to the set of MD-generated conformers. Separately, both the full set of MD conformers as well as the three conformers with the lowest molecular mechanics (MM) energy of interaction were considered for each system. The average predicted affinity was obtained, considering either the full set of MD conformers or just the three with the lowest MM energy of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Noticeably, the ML models applied to energy minimized complexes (conformers prior to MD simulations) did not provide consistent results among the rankings. These structures have appreciably higher MM energy than the MD structures, suggesting that the consistent rankings of the MD structures reflect more native-like structures and that the MD protocol of confirmation selection is effective to account for the conformational flexibility of the receptor.</p>

<title>Molecular re-docking of 3CLpro C-terminus</title>
<p id="P53">Chains A and B from the crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro-NEMO described in this study were used to estimate the contributions of local interactions to the binding affinity of the C-terminus to the dimer interfacial site. The C-terminus of chain B seats between Domains I in the dimer formed with chain A. Chains A and D were used as receptor and ligand, respectively, to estimate the contributions of local interactions to the binding affinity of the C-terminus to a catalytic site in a neighboring dimer. For the calculations of C-terminus at the interfacial and catalytic binding sites, a peptide comprising residues 302 to 306 was defined from the C-terminus of chain B and D, respectively, detaching it from the rest of the protein by deleting residues 300 and 301. N- and C-termini of these peptides were capped with acetyl and N-methylamide, respectively. Molecular re-docking of the C-terminus peptides was performed using AutoDock Vina <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>

The ranking displayed was consistent for nine of the ten cases of MD conformers (5 ML models applied to either all MD conformers or the three lowest-energy MD conformers, yielding 5 × 2 = 10 cases). The exception was a boosted tree model trained on unnormalized features that yielded a ranking of SARS-CoV &lt; MERS-CoV &lt; HKU1-CoV &lt; SARS-CoV-2 when considering just the conformers with the lowest energy of interaction with 3CLpro computed from MD simulations. *Unscaled refers to the fact that unscaled, or unnormalized, features were used in the training.</p>

<title>Comparison of 3CLpro interactions with its N-terminal sequence and NEMO.</title>
<p>The surface of chain C from our NEMO-bound structure is depicted as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>. This is juxtaposed with residues from our structure that form interactions with NEMO (light blue sticks) as well as residues (green sticks) from a structure of 3CLpro bound to an N-terminal peptide (PDB ID: 7N89). Residues forming conserved interactions are labelled in black. Those found only in NEMO-bound 3CLpro are labelled in light blue. Those found only in 7N89 are labelled in green. Water molecules are portrayed as red spheres and are exclusive to 7N89. Met165 forms a hydrophobic contact with the P2 and P4 residues of NEMO but only with P2 with the N-terminal peptide. Met49 forms a hydrophobic contact with the P2 residues of both NEMO and the N-terminus, but also forms hydrophobic contacts with P1’ and P3’ of the N-terminal sequence. Substrates are excluded for clarity.</p>
