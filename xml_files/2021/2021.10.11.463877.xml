We found that RSV induces higher interferon (IFN) β production than IAV and that IFNβ priming confers higher protection against infection with IAV than with RSV. Consequently, we focused on the sequential infection scheme: RSV-then-IAV. Using the A549 WT, IFNAR1 KO, IFNLR1 KO, and IFNAR1–IFNLR1 double KO cell lines we found that both IFNβ and IFNλ are necessary for maximum protection against subsequent infection. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. Strikingly, the susceptible cells turned out to be those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander, interferon-primed cells are resistant to IAV infection.

Out of a plethora of respiratory viruses, recently expanded by the novel beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), the three most common recurrent infectants, originating from different viral families, are rhinovirus (human RV, HRV), influenza A virus (IAV), and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, human orthopneumovirus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), with the latest being the most common pathogen in severe disease in young children and the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In temperate areas of the northern hemisphere, the incidence of respiratory infections surges in the winter season and subsides during summer. Detailed examination of temporal patterns of disease outbreaks reveals not only seasonal coincidence but also apparent avoidance of some types of cocirculating respiratory viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). It is unclear whether the epidemiological observations are population-level consequences of an interplay of multiple viral cooperation and competition mechanisms that operate at a single-host level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Intriguingly, the epidemiological avoidance patterns are visible also for taxonomically different groups of viruses, suggesting their potential reliance on mechanisms that are not related to specific antibody-mediated cross-protection. Although viral interference can be readily observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), its underlying mechanisms are necessarily inextricably intertwined with the response of the host organism and await elucidation from a systemic perspective.</p><p id="P3">Non-antigenic competitive interactions among respiratory viruses have been suggested based on clinical data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and were recapitulated within animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Two very recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) demonstrated that an innate immunity mechanism, specifically antiviral cytokine signaling, is implicated in the interference between RV and IAV: blocking the type I interferon (IFN) response restores IAV replication following RV infection. Whereas type I IFNs (IFNα and IFNβ) were originally discovered specifically because of their activity against the influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), their roles in RSV infection and disease have been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). A recent animal model study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) suggested that the RSV–IAV viral interference is antigen-independent, however direct involvement of IFNs has not been demonstrated.</p><p id="P4">Type I IFNs, together with the more recently identified type III IFNs (IFNλ1–λ4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), are produced and secreted by infected cells to trigger transcription of an array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both the infected and the bystander cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Elevated ISGs restrict viral replication until virus-specific host defense mechanisms develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). IFNα and IFNβ additionally attract specific immune system cells to the site of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). IFNλ acts more locally, preferentially at epithelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), and differentially affects tissue homeostasis: while IFNλ confers longer lasting protection than IFNα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), chronic IFNλ exposure inhibits proliferation of respiratory epithelial cells, impairing post-infection lung regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). A significant relative potency of IFNλ in induction of an antiviral state in response to IAV has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). In the absence of IFNβ, IFNλ has been proposed to be the primary factor preventing RSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Propagation of RSV strongly depends on the expression of its two nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2, that, among multiple modalities of interference with the innate immune response, block the synthesis of interferons and downregulate the expression of ISGs (by inhibition of STAT1/2 signaling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Of note, the strength of the immune response to RSV increases with the contents of the immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (DVGs), typically incomplete viral progeny that can stimulate production of interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). DVGs are naturally generated during RSV replication and may limit the spread of RSV as well as other coinfecting viruses. <italic>In vitro</italic>, at low multiplicities of infection, when the selective pressure on virus is high, the incidence of DVGs is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The kinetics of DVGs accumulation may predict the clinical outcome of an RSV infection in humans; detection of DVGs early after infection has been associated with low viral loads and mild disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we sought to determine molecular underpinnings of the interactions between RSV and IAV. We used a human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) and characterized direct inter-viral relations and interferon-mediated interference <italic>in vitro</italic> at the single-cell level. We found that RSV induces higher IFNβ production than IAV and that IFNβ is a more potent inducer of STAT1/2 signaling than IFNλ1. Moreover, IFNβ-stimulated cells are more resistant to infection with IAV than to infection with RSV. In light of these findings, we focused on the sequential coinfection scheme, in which cells are preinfected with RSV and then infected with IAV. We developed A549-derived cell lines with knockout (KO) of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1 KO), type III IFN receptor subunit (IFNLR1 KO), and double KO (IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO). They enabled us to find that IFNβ is the main inducer of an antiviral state in an RSV-infected population of A549 cells and both interferons, IFNβ and IFNλ, are simultaneously necessary for building maximum protection against a subsequent infection with IAV. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. Strikingly, the susceptible cells turned out to be those already compromised and efficiently expressing the priming virus. Overall, we conclude that in the sequential RSV-then-IAV infection scheme, the virus–virus exclusion at the cell-population level is not realized through a direct competition for a shared ecological niche (single cell) but rather achieved with the involvement of specific cytokines induced within the host innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IFNβ and IFNλ mediate STAT1/2 activation upon RSV and IAV infection</title><p id="P7">We first characterized induction of the antiviral state by interferon signaling. We found that RSV is a more potent inducer of IFNβ than IAV at comparable MOIs during 48 hours post-infection (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, upon infection with RSV at low MOI, only a tiny fraction of cells (1–5%) produces IFNβ, which is however sufficient to activate the STAT pathway in remaining cells. Cells expressing IFNβ typically do not express RSV proteins which may result from the early stage of infection, suppression of RSV protein expression by innate immune response in infected cells, or infection by DVGs. At the same time, in cells that express RSV proteins, non-structural proteins may inhibit synthesis of IFNβ at various levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Detection of viral RNA within an RSV-infected cell is manifested by activation of IRF3 (which gets phosphorylated and then translocates to the nucleus becoming visible in images from immunostaining). Propagation of RSV and IAV for 48 hours from MOI = 0.01, induction of STAT1 activity and its inhibition over time are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, respectively.</p><p id="P8">We then analyzed interferon-mediated activation of STAT1/2 during RSV or IAV infection and consecutive induction of ISGs that are the primary correlates of the antiviral state: RIG-I (viral RNA sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>)), PKR (indirect translation inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>)), and OAS1 (direct activator of RNase L, the RNA eradicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>)). We juxtaposed results for A549 WT cells with those for the A549-derived cell lines in which we knocked out IFNα/β receptor IFNAR1, heterodimeric IFNλ receptor subunit IFNLR1, and both these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). We observed that infection with RSV or IAV leads to robust activation (phosphorylation) of STAT1 and STAT2 in A549 WT cells as well as in IFNLR1 KO cells. In IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO cells, there is no observable STAT1/2 phosphorylation, whereas in IFNAR1 KO cells, secreted type III IFNs (IFNλ) leads to relatively weak STAT1/2 phosphorylation. The observed patterns of STAT activity translate directly to the patterns of accumulation of RIG-I, PKR, and OAS1, as well as STAT1 and STAT2, with the exception of IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO cells, in which after RSV we observe an increase of RIG-I and PKR, which is apparently independent of STAT1–STAT2 signaling. Cells devoid of the receptor for IFNβ, but not cells devoid of the receptor for IFNλ, show higher levels of RSV fusion glycoprotein, suggesting faster virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Of note, the lack of either IFNβ receptor or IFNλ receptor facilitates IAV replication, despite IFNLR1 KO having minimal impact on STAT1/2 signaling and accumulation of ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that despite divergent efficacy of IFNβ induction by RSV and IAV, upon infection with any of these viruses, IFNβ is the main activator of STAT1 and STAT2 signaling. We did not analyze the impact of IFNγ, because the lack of STAT1 activation in IFNAR1 KO cells and in IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) suggests that this cytokine is not released by the studied cells and as such does not contribute to the inhibition of viral proliferation in our experimental setup.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Prestimulation with IFNβ inhibits propagation of RSV and IAV</title><p id="P9">To estimate the impact of priming with IFNβ and IFNλ1 on the infectiousness and propagation of RSV and IAV, we quantified viral RNA molecules per cell and analyzed the abundance of viral proteins. We performed infection experiments without or with a preceding, day-long stimulation with IFNβ (1000 U/ml) or with IFNλ1 (50 ng/ml). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we juxtaposed results for these two stimulation protocols. We found that 24 hours post-infection at MOI 0.1, prestimulation with IFNβ limits RSV progeny by nearly one order of magnitude, whereas IAV progeny is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). At MOI 1, when nearly all cells are infected, prestimulation with IFNβ limits RSV proliferation about five-fold, while the relative reduction of IAV proliferation is as significant as in the case of the lower MOI (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Prestimulation with IFNβ triggers the antiviral state manifested by accumulation of ISGs: RIG-I, PKR, and OAS1 and STAT1/2. These proteins maintain their elevated levels 48 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Consequently, viral proteins are less abundant in the IFNβ-prestimulated cells than in the non-prestimulated cells. We conclude results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> by stating that both IFNβ and IFNλ secreted by infected cells are responsible for confinement of the spread of IAV, however only IFNβ appears to be capable of attenuating the propagation of RSV.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Impact of RSV or IAV infection on STAT1 activation</title><p id="P10">To analyze at the single-cell level how infected cells induce the antiviral state in bystander cells, we performed infections at MOI 0.1, fixed the cells 24 hours post-infection, and immunostained them for active IRF3 (as an evidence of detection of viral RNA by cell), p-STAT1 (used as an indication of the antiviral state), and viral proteins. In two-channel overlays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, it can be noticed that p-STAT1 is present in most bystander cells (at various levels), whereas the infected cells exhibit p-STAT1 only sporadically. This effect may indicate the capability of the viruses to suppress the response to IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). We quantified this effect by looking directly at the presence of viral proteins as the definite manifestation of productive infection, and at nuclear p-STAT1 as an indication of antiviral alertness. Based on the expression of RSV proteins or IAV nucleoprotein, we classified cells as either virus-positive or virus-negative and collected histograms of nuclear p-STAT1 intensity in each cell within the two groups. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> we can see that the two distributions are indeed different for virus-positive and virus-negative cells, with on average higher STAT1 phosphorylation in virus-negative cells. This indicates that the antiviral state is more pronounced in bystander uninfected cells than in RSV-infected or IAV-infected cells 24 hours post-infection. To express the extent to which the two distributions are disjoint, we calculated the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic. KS attains 1 for fully disjoint distributions and 0 for exactly overlapping distributions. Across all experimental replicates, KS lies in the range 0.42–0.58 (95% CrI: 0.39–0.67) in the case of infection with RSV and in the range 0.57–0.59 (95% CrI: 0.51–0.68) in the case of infection with IAV. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref> documenting a decline of STAT1 phosphorylation in viral proteins-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Effect of prestimulation with IFNβ or IFNλ1 on IAV spread in A549 WT cells</title><p id="P11">Thus far, we have used cell-population techniques to show that IFNβ is a more potent inducer of the antiviral state than IFNλ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and, as a consequence, in A549 cells viral proliferation is more suppressed after prestimulation with IFNβ than with IFNλ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Since RSV turned out to elicit stronger IFNβ response than IAV, to characterize the potential interferon-mediated cross-protection between the two viruses we decided to investigate specifically the dual infection scheme in which the cells are first preinfected with RSV and after 24 hours infected with IAV.</p><p id="P12">To gain insight into the interferon-mediated interaction at the single-cell level, we quantified the protective effect of IFNβ or IFNλ1 in the context of IAV infection based on imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> we show proportions of cells expressing viral nucleoprotein 24 hours after treatment with IAV at MOI = 1 in each field of view in the case of non-prestimulated A549 WT cells and A549 WT cells that were prestimulated with either IFNβ or IFNλ1. Based on image quantifications for two experimental replicates, we found that 40–45% of non-prestimulated cells express nucleoprotein 24 hours after infection. This proportion drops to about 3% after prestimulation with IFNβ and to about 10% after prestimulation with IFNλ1. Relations between these proportions provide additional evidence for strong attenuation of the IAV spread conferred by IFNs in A549 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RSV preinfection inhibits IAV infection in an interferon-dependent manner</title><p id="P13">In the course of viral infection there are cells that are initially infected by the primary virus and bystander cells that, in response to IFN secreted by the initially infected cells, may develop the antiviral state and become partially protected from secondary infections. Our prior experiments with IFN prestimulation and high IAV MOI allowed us to characterize the response of the cells that had uniformly developed the antiviral state and were then challenged with the virus, which mimics only one subpopulation of the cells that appears during ongoing infection. Since in our dual infection scheme we wanted to apply the second virus to a cell population that consist of the subpopulation of the preinfected and IFN-producing cells and the subpopulation of not (yet) infected but IFN-stimulated cells, we primed cells with the first virus, RSV, at MOI = 0.1 and after 30 hours applied the second virus, IAV, at MOI = 1. To corroborate and discern the relative importance of IFNβ or IFNλ in their native RSV-elicited mixture, we used additionally A549 IFNAR1 KO, IFNLR1 KO, and IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO cell lines.</p><p id="P14">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, we show imaging-based single-cell level analysis of the cell population after dual infection. After preinfection with RSV, the proportion of WT A549 cells infected with the second virus, IAV, is reduced by an order of magnitude with respect to non-preinfected cells (<italic>cf</italic>. non-prestimulated WT cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and RSV-primed WT cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, which gives a tenfold reduction of IAV nucleoprotein-expressing cells, from ~40% to ~4%). The protective effect conferred by RSV-priming is significantly weaker in IFNAR1 KO cells incapable of responding to IFNβ (reduction from ~40% to ~20%) and only slightly weaker in IFNLR1 KO cells incapable of responding to IFNλ (reduction from ~40% to ~10%). The priming effect is virtually non-existent in cells devoid of receptors for both IFNβ and IFNλ. According to dPCR measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, the amount of IAV RNA in a population of RSV-preinfected WT cells is 10–20 times lower than in a non-preinfected population of WT cells. Additionally, in populations of RSV-preinfected cells from three KO cell lines, the amount of IAV RNA is higher than in the WT cell population, and the ratios of IAV RNA expression between these lines are similar to the ratios of IAV-infected cell proportions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>. Since IFNs block IAV at the level of replication of viral RNA and synthesis of viral proteins, the accumulated effect at the level of viral proteins may be expected to be more pronounced.</p><p id="P15">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, we demonstrate that the protective effect conferred by RSV-priming depends on RSV MOI. The strongest protection is achieved for intermediate RSV MOI of ~0.1–0.3, whereas for RSV MOI of ~1, protection is a bit weaker and for RSV MOI of ~0.01 it is much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). At the lowest considered RSV MOI, a small number of cells secrete IFNs, which is likely insufficient to evoke the pervasive antiviral state in bystander cells. We note that varying pre-RSV MOI is somewhat similar to changing the time interval between subsequent infections, because longer intervals permit more secondary infections with the priming virus and higher accumulation of interferons.</p><p id="P16">Overall, this demonstrates that preinfection with RSV protects from infection with IAV in an interferon-dependent manner in A549 cells. The protective effect may be attributed nearly entirely to the paracrine stimulation with both IFNβ and IFNλ, with a major contribution from IFNβ.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>IAV infects preferentially the cells that express RSV proteins</title><p id="P17">Visual inspection of WT cells suggested that IAV nucleoprotein is preferentially expressed in the cells with apparent expression of RSV proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). To quantitatively verify this hypothesis, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, we classified cells as virus-positive and virus-negative. We decided to use the measured level of IAV NP as the binary criterion because of its mostly nuclear location, which facilitates image analysis. We then collected histograms of intensity of RSV proteins in the cells belonging to these two groups. Clearly, in A549 WT cells, the IAV+ cells are associated with higher abundance of RSV proteins than IAV− cells (KS of 0.62 [95% CrI: 0.599–0.643] indicates good discernibility). This effect is much weaker in IFNAR1–IFNLR1 dKO cells, which cannot respond to IFNβ or IFNλ (KS of 0.15 [95% CrI: 0.137–0.154] indicates that the two distributions are nearly overlapping). This clearly shows that the RSV–IAV exclusion is not realized through a direct competition for a shared ecological niche, a single cell, but rather achieved with the involvement of interferon signaling.</p><p id="P18">Based on distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref> we introduced a threshold at which two distributions are best separable (vertical dot-dashed line), allowing us to stratify cells into RSV-positive and RSV-negative ones. Then we found that in experiments with WT cells, among RSV-positive cells (that constituted 20% of all cells), 11% were IAV-positive, whereas among RSV-negative cells (that constituted 80% of all cells), less than 1% were IAV-positive. In experiments with dKO cells, among RSV-positive dKO cells (that constituted 25% of all cells), 56% were IAV-positive and among RSV-negative cells (that constituted 75% of all cells), as much as 37% were IAV-positive.</p><p id="P19">To demonstrate that the RSV-and-IAV coinfections observed at the single-cell level are mainly due to IAV infections of cells that already express RSV proteins, we performed an experiment in which 40 hours after infection with RSV (at MOI = 0.1) cells are infected with IAV, for either 10 or 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Within this protocol it is less probable that a cell that has not been infected during the first 40 hours becomes infected jointly with two viruses in the last 10 hours of the experiment. Immunostaining images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>) clearly show that localization of IAV-infected cells recapitulates the spatial pattern of RSV-infected cell clusters and the cells infected with IAV have a higher chance to be infected with RSV (and <italic>vice versa</italic>).

When challenged by a virus, the innate immune system acts to impede pathogen replication before a more specific adaptive response is evoked. In the context of sequential viral coinfections, the priming virus both breaks through the innate protection in infected cells and, indirectly, via interferon secreted by these cells, triggers the protective antiviral state in bystander cells. These two antagonistic processes determine the fate of both the primary and the secondary infection at the cell-population level.</p><p id="P22">To obtain insight into this interplay at the single-cell level, we studied how upon a priming infection with RSV, individual cells become either cross-protected or, conversely, more vulnerable to the second virus, IAV. The choice of these two pathogens has been motivated by the fact that RSV and influenza viruses show relatively high coincidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). The particular order of infections that we focused on results from our observations that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) RSV induces higher IFNβ production than IAV, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) IFNβ-stimulated cells are more resistant to infection with IAV than to infection with RSV, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) IAV is sensitive to IFNλ and this sensitivity does not rely solely on STAT1/2 signaling. We thus inferred that the potential cross-protection may be more pronounced in the RSV-then-IAV protocol, which is consistent with a comparison of RSV-then-IAV and IAV-then-RSV coinfections in a mouse model, showing that the IAV-then-RSV coinfection is associated with higher IAV loads and mouse mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>)).</p><p id="P23">We found that IFNβ is the main inducer of the STAT1/2-associated antiviral state in RSVinfected A549 cells and both interferons, IFNβ and IFNλ, are simultaneously necessary for building maximum protection against a subsequent infection with IAV. A synergistic effect of type I and type III interferon, consistent with our findings, has been previously reported in mice by Mordstein <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). In our coinfection experiments, we infected the epithelial alveolar cells with RSV at MOI of 0.1 to readily observe their stratification into the compromised infected cells and the reinforced bystander cells. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to a subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. This dynamic functional differentiation of cells may be amplified <italic>in vivo</italic> by differential propensity of specific cell types to permit or restrict viral replication, produce interferons, and build up the antiviral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). We found that the susceptible cells turned out to be predominantly those already compromised and efficiently expressing the priming virus. This means that after preinfection the population of cells susceptible to a secondary infectant is largely limited to those yielding preinfectant progeny, proportion of which depends on the multiplicity of the preinfection and time interval between infections. The optimal cross protection effect may thus ensue when the proportion of cells preinfected with RSV is relatively low yet sufficient to trigger a pervasive antiviral state in bystander cells. In the case of massive infection with RSV, when most cells are simultaneously compromised by the virus, the interferon-mediated protection likely does not come into effect. The protective effect of RSV infection may increase with the yield of DVGs, which due to the lack of nonstructural proteins may both more efficiently trigger synthesis of interferons and leave STAT signaling unscathed.</p><p id="P24">The natural question is to what extent the described cross-protection mechanism reduces the incidence of coinfections or severity of the disease featured by a secondary infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Answering the question is especially important, but appears complex, in the context of secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections. An early study by Ziegler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) showed that the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is a protein coded by ISG, but later Onabajo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) identified the transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of <italic>ACE2, deltaACE2,</italic> not <italic>ACE2,</italic> as an ISG. Since deltaACE2 may not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the latter study suggests that interferon signaling is not hijacked by this virus to enhance its proliferation. Several studies suggested beneficial roles of type I and type III interferon at the early stage of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). It is thus possible that interferons secreted in response to a primary infection exhibit a protective role against a secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>)).</p><p id="P25">At the clinical level, one may expect that the occurrence of coinfections may result from defective work of the immune system (which aggravates the course of the disease and also imaginably cannot mediate antagonistic viral interactions). Although this effect cannot be excluded and coinfection data should be treated with caution, impact of coinfections on disease severity is unclear. Most respiratory viral coinfections, detected usually in a small proportion of patients, appear not to increase severity of clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), with two noteworthy exceptions of a coinfection by IAV and IBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) and coinfections with RSV in pediatric patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). It should be noted that interactions of two respiratory viruses within the host can hardly be translated to their coincidence or avoidance in human populations. This is because at the population level there are two additional and antagonistic effects: on one hand, viral coincidence of contagious diseases can be seasonal (the effective contact rate is modulated by weather and behavioral patterns); on the other hand, infected and ill individuals change their behavior to avoid contact. A significant behavioral reduction of the contact rate may result from an outbreak of an epidemic of a threatening virus, decreasing the risk of propagation of other viruses, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the infection with RSV at low MOI protects alveolar epithelial cells against infection with IAV. Whereas RSV-infected cells are more vulnerable to infection with IAV, priming with RSV indirectly protects bystander non-infected cells from IAV. The cross-protection mechanism relies on induction of and paracrine stimulation with both type I and type III interferons.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines and cultures</title><p id="P27">The A549 and MDCK cell lines were purchased from ATTC.

All cell lines were cultured in standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO2) and kept in monolayers up to 90% confluency. The IFNAR1, IFNLR1, and IFNAR1–IFNLR1 knockouts based on A549 were engendered using the CRISPR lentivirus system (Abm). To obtain A549-based knockouts, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with commercially available plasmids encoding Cas9 nuclease (Abm, cat. K002), lentivirus packaging particles (Abm, cat.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>The influenza A virus (IAV) and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common recurrent respiratory infectants, which show a relatively high coincidence. We demonstrated that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. The susceptible cells are those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander cells are resistant to IAV infection. The cross-protective effect critically depends on IFNβ and IFNλ signaling and thus ensues when the proportion of cells preinfected with RSV is relatively low yet sufficient to trigger a pervasive antiviral state in bystander cells. Our study suggests that mild, but not severe, respiratory infections may have a short-lasting protective role against more dangerous respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>IFNβ and IFNλ mediate STAT1 and STAT2 activation upon RSV and IAV infection in A549 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) ELISA for IFNβ following (A) RSV and (B) IAV infection, both at MOI = 0.1 and MOI = 1.
