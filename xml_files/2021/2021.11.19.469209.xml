Given the high degree of shared processing in neural structures, it is critical to understand if neurostimulation affects functions that are related to, but not targeted by the intervention. Here we approached this question by studying the effects of electrical stimulation of cutaneous afferents on unrelated processing of proprioceptive inputs. We recorded intra-spinal neural activity in four monkeys while generating proprioceptive inputs from the radial nerve. We then applied continuous stimulation to the radial nerve cutaneous branch and quantified the impact of the stimulation on spinal processing of proprioceptive inputs via neural population dynamics. Proprioceptive pulses consistently produced neural trajectories that were disrupted by concurrent cutaneous stimulation. This disruption propagated to the somatosensory cortex, suggesting that electrical stimulation can perturb natural information processing across the neural axis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Decades of animal and human studies have shown that neurostimulation technologies can restore some level of neurological function in patients with sensorimotor deficits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). These novel technologies produce immediate assistive effects, achieving a controlled restoration of multifaceted behavioral processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). For instance, in humans peripheral neuroprostheses successfully restore touch sensations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) , and spinal cord stimulation enables the recovery of voluntary motor control(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). While these remarkable results are fueling the translation of these technologies in clinical settings, the understanding of the short- and long-term effects of injecting electrical current into existing neural dynamics is still entirely unknown. In fact, virtually all these interventions suffer from a latent, yet critical caveat: the input delivered to the neural circuits is artificially generated, being widely different from naturally-generated neural activity.</p><p id="P3">Indeed, electrical stimulation produces synchronized volleys of neural activity in all recruited axons (or cells), rather than the asynchronous bursts of inputs that govern natural neural activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). What is the consequence of this stark difference with respect to neural function? Recently, some studies demonstrated that electrical stimulation actually triggers side effects at the neural level, which were initially unnoticed. For example, new data from epidural spinal cord stimulation for spinal cord injury showed that continuous stimulation of recruited sensory afferents produces a disruption of proprioceptive percepts at stimulation parameters commonly employed in clinical trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Similarly, the inability to elicit robust proprioceptive percepts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) is striking in the application of electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves for the restoration of somato-sensations.</p><p id="P4">In fact, large-diameter proprioceptive afferents should have the lowest threshold for electrical stimulation. Therefore, these afferents should be the easiest sensory afferents to recruit with neural interfaces(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, because of anatomical and geometrical constraints, in practice electrical neurostimulation leads to the activation of mixed diameter fiber distributions and, consequently, different sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Therefore, cutaneous afferents are recruited concurrently, along with larger diameter afferents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). These fibers converge on interneurons in the spinal cord where they undergo the first layer of sensory processing, representing a highly shared sensory network node.</p><p id="P5">It is conceivable that artificially-generated patterns of mixed neural activity hinder some of the computations of these shared network nodes, thus impairing natural circuit processing, hence, perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). In order to demonstrate this conjecture, we need tools that allow us to visualize and identify a direct measure of neural computation processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Analysis of population neural dynamics using neural manifolds is commonly employed to study computational objects that process information in the cortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and, more recently, in the spinal cord. Indeed, one study showed that intraspinal population responses contain simple structures that enable the examination of complex processes such as walking(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Therefore, here we employed neural population analysis of intraspinal neural dynamics to 1) visualize neural computations underlying the processing of brief proprioceptive percepts elicited by single short pulses of electrical stimulation and 2) study how these computations were altered when concurrent electrical stimulation was delivered to sensory afferents from a different nerve. This experimental design offered a simplified version of the more general problem of the stimulation effects on unrelated neural functions, thus allowing us to execute casual manipulation and quantification of neural variables.</p><p id="P7">Therefore, we designed a series of electrophysiology experiments in anesthetized monkeys, who share distinguishable projections with the human nervous system distinct from all other animals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We recorded and analyzed artificially evoked proprioceptive neural signals both in the cervical spinal cord and somatosensory cortex. Specifically, we induced proprioceptive input in the hand and forearm by cuff electrode stimulation of the muscle branch of the radial nerve, which does not contain cutaneous afferents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Then, we studied how concurrent stimulation of somatosensory afferents in the cutaneous branch of the radial nerve impacted the spinal and cortical proprioceptive responses. Using neural population analysis, we examined dorso-ventral intra-spinal spiking activity in response to muscle nerve stimulation pulses and performed dimensionality reduction to observe the spinal neural trajectories. Concurrent stimulation of the cutaneous afferents disrupted these neural trajectories, suggesting a significant degradation of proprioceptive information processing in the spinal cord. Changes in proprioceptive information appeared as reduced cortical responses in the somatosensory cortex. Our results show that intraspinal neural population dynamics can capture the processing of sensorimotor information in spinal networks and its disruption of this information processing during artificial electrical stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Simultaneous brain and spinal neural recordings during electrical nerve stimulation of multiple sensory modalities</title><p id="P8">We designed a unique experimental setup in non-human primates as a proxy to understand how artificial inputs can influence neural network function in a controlled fashion. Specifically, we examined how stimulation of cutaneous afferents affects spinal network processing of proprioceptive pulses. The radial nerve, carrying sensory signals from the dorsal part of the forearm and hand, splits in proximity of the elbow into a pure-muscle and a pure-cutaneous branch (i.e., the deep and superficial branches of the radial nerve(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), respectively) offering the opportunity to provide modality-selective sensory stimuli. We implanted cuff electrodes on these two branches to elicit either proprioceptive or cutaneous inputs via electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We artificially provided brief proprioceptive pulses by stimulating the muscle branch of the radial nerve with single electrical pulses (~2 Hz) below motor threshold. To assess the influence of artificial cutaneous input on the induced proprioceptive input, we provided cutaneous stimulation as continuous ~50 Hz pulses, a typical stimulation frequency used in human studies. Threshold (Thr) was defined as an amplitude that clearly evoked potentials in the spinal cord in response to low-frequency stimulation. We tested two conditions: stimulating the nerve at a low (0.9 x Thr) or high amplitude (1.1 x Thr). Stimulation amplitude corresponds to the amount of artificially recruited fibers. To study the transmission of artificially induced proprioceptive percepts from the periphery to the cerebral cortex, we recorded the Macaque monkeys’ intra-spinal neural signals from a dorso-ventral 32-channel linear probe implanted in the gray matter of the spinal cord C5 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, we extracted intra-cortical neural signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) using a 32-channel UTAH array placed in the somatosensory cortex (Area S1/S2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In summary, we recorded neural signals in the spinal cord and the somatosensory cortex of three anesthetized Macaca Fascicularis (MK1, MK2, MK4) and one Macaca Mulatta (MK3) monkey while stimulating only proprioceptive, or concurrently proprioceptive and cutaneous afferents.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Proprioceptive inputs elicit robust trajectories in the spinal neural manifold</title><p id="P11">We explored the effect of brief pulses of artificially-generated proprioceptive inputs on the intraspinal neural population dynamics. Because proprioceptive signals enter the spinal cord from the dorsal aspect and project towards medial and ventral laminae(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), we performed neural population analysis of the multiunit spiking data from all the channels of our linear probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) in response to 2 Hz muscle nerve stimulation. Specifically, we applied dimensionality reduction to unveil the latent properties of the spinal neural processing via principal component analysis (PCA). PCA identified three neural modes that sufficed to explain 54-65% of the variance of the spikes counts of multiunit threshold crossings recorded by the spinal probe for ~350 ms following each proprioceptive stimulus pulse. We then sought whether the neural manifold defined by these neural modes contained simple computational objects (e.g., clear neural trajectories that captured the changes of timevarying spikes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In the spinal manifold, the multiunit spike counts elicited very consistent dynamics after each stimulation pulse in the form of closed trajectories that were qualitatively similar in all monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Because averaged spiking responses initiated and terminated with baseline activity (i.e., no stimulation), the neural dynamics were represented by closed neural trajectories. Given the robustness and reproducibility of these trajectories, we hypothesized that estimated trajectory lengths could be used as a proxy to measure the amount of proprioceptive information processed within the recorded site. The logical consequence of this interpretation is that the length of the trajectories could be proportional to the amount of proprioceptive input processed.</p><p id="P13">Since the stimulation amplitude controls the number of recruited afferents, we tested this assumption by computing the neural trajectories induced by proprioceptive inputs both at high and low stimulation amplitudes (i.e., more or less recruited afferents, respectively). As expected, we found that muscle nerve stimulation at a higher amplitude elicited longer trajectories and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This observation was consistent in MK1 (relative mean difference, +14.17%), MK2 (+24.05%) and MK3 (+44.21%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), but not in MK4 (-33.76%), probably due to the higher variability in the overall trajectories for this monkey.</p><p id="P14">In summary, we showed that population analysis of a dorso-ventral linear probe in the spinal cord shows highly robust and reproducible trajectories in the neural manifold in response to artificial proprioceptive pulses. We proposed to quantify the length of this trajectory as a means to assess the amount of proprioceptive information processed in the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Continuous electrical stimulation of the cutaneous nerve disrupts intra-spinal proprioceptive neural trajectories</title><p id="P15">We next evaluated the impact of concurrent artificial cutaneous input on proprioceptive information processing. We projected on the neural manifold neural trajectories elicited by the stimulation of the proprioceptive branch. All four monkeys exhibited robust trajectories in response to proprioceptive inputs and, in all four monkeys, concurrent stimulation of cutaneous afferents significantly reduced the trajectory lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) or even completely disrupted their dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), albeit with different effect sizes. MK1 (relative mean difference, -66.03%), MK3 (-27.47%) and MK4 (-44.91%) exhibited the largest disruption, while MK2 (-5.89%) was significantly disrupted but to a lower effect size.</p><p id="P16">To validate this result, we repeated the same experiment using lower amplitudes for the stimulation of the cutaneous afferents. Cutaneous stimulation at a low amplitude yielded less disruption (i.e., longer proprioceptive trajectory lengths) than at a high stimulation amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that the amount of neural computation disrupted is inversely proportional to stimulation intensity of cutaneous afferents. This observed trajectory disruption is particularly interesting considering that, during concurrent proprioceptive and cutaneous stimulation, the spinal cord received significantly more artificial input. Indeed, concurrent stimulation of the cutaneous afferents significantly increased overall spike counts in the recorded spinal circuitries (+5191.68% for MK1, +234.71% for MK2, +68.37% for MK3, +754.94% for MK4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). However, this increase was not captured by the neural trajectories, which strengthens the case that those trajectory lengths mainly represent proprioceptive information processing.</p><p id="P17">Additionally, we found that the disruption of information processing was captured in principal component (PC) 2 and PC3, where neural trajectories shrunk as a function of stimulation intensity. Moreover, PC1 depicted the displacement of these neural trajectories caused by the amount of concurrent cutaneous input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In other words, when the spinal cord received inputs induced by concurrent muscle and cutaneous nerves stimulation, the neural trajectories were displaced across PC1, away from the proprioceptive neural trajectories. This displacement was proportional to the stimulation intensity and, in turn, to the computed spiking activity in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In particular, MK1 (+94.52%) and MK2 (+45.99%) produced longer proprioceptive trajectory lengths than MK3 (+3.49%) and MK4 (+5.22%) during concurrent cutaneous stimulation at a low amplitude. Indeed, the overall spike counts were very similar in MK3 and MK4 both at low and high stimulation amplitudes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>) (relative mean difference from concurrent high to low amplitude, -84.44% for MK1, -59.82% for MK2, -1.69% for MK3, -8.40% for MK4), thereby eliciting similar neural trajectory lengths. These results infer that the main PCs clearly captured the amount of proprioceptive processed information as a function of concurrent stimulation amplitude. Indeed, neural trajectories that were further displaced across PC1 resulted in shorter neural trajectory lengths in PC2-PC3 (during concurrent high stimulation amplitude), whereas those that remained closer to the proprioceptive neural trajectories in PC1 were less disrupted in PC2-PC3 (during concurrent low stimulation amplitude, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In summary, we showed that concurrent stimulation of the cutaneous nerve significantly suppressed proprioceptive neural trajectory lengths, suggesting that concurrent artificial recruitment of cutaneous afferents hinders the processing of proprioceptive inputs in the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cutaneous electrical stimulation reduced proprioceptive afferent volleys, spinal cord grey matter field potentials and multiunit responses</title><p id="P19">To validate our findings, we looked for correlates using classical electrophysiology measures. We first inspected stimulation triggered average field potentials from the grey matter of the spinal cord, defined as the mean neural response across each single muscle nerve branch stimulation pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Afferent volleys were detected at a latency between 3-4 ms after each proprioceptive pulse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig5a</xref>). Continuous electrical stimulation of the cutaneous nerve reduced the peak-to-peak amplitude of these proprioceptive volleys in all four monkeys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) and the reduction was proportional to stimulation intensity (muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation high amplitude, mean values difference: MK1: -9%, MK2: -47%, MK3: -25%, MK4: -14%; muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation low amplitude: MK1: -8%, MK2: -40%, MK3: -22%, MK4: -1%). Since volleys represent sensory inputs, these results suggest that part of the disruption that we observed in the neural trajectories may be a consequence of reduced proprioceptive inputs in the spinal cord.</p><p id="P20">Additionally, grey matter response fields following each proprioceptive volley were also substantially suppressed during electrical stimulation. Peak-to-peak amplitude values of the fields were significantly reduced to a much larger extent than the volleys. Again, the suppression correlated to stimulation intensity: high amplitude of cutaneous stimulation resulted in greater suppression of afferent volleys and grey matter response fields peak to peak values than at a low stimulation amplitude (muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation high amplitude, mean values difference: MK1: -83%, MK2: -18%, MK3: -46%, MK4: -56%; muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation low amplitude: MK1: -48%, MK2: -15%, MK3: -42%, MK4: -43%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The same trend was found in all 4 monkeys, suggesting that a significant component of the trajectory disruption may be related to reduced grey matter responses to proprioceptive volleys and not only to a simple reduction of proprioceptive inputs.</p><p id="P21">Finally, we investigated whether changes in the population neural dynamics and grey matter field potentials could be reflected in changes of single neuron spiking activity. We utilized multiunit threshold crossing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and identified channels in which a clear response to proprioceptive pulses was visible. In this multiunit analysis, the peak of neural activity after proprioceptive stimuli occurred at approximately 3 – 4 ms after each proprioceptive stimulation pulse. We present the neural responses of units that were activated by proprioceptive inputs. When continuous stimulation of the cutaneous nerve was overlapped with muscle nerve stimulation, we observed a reduction in these responses in all four monkeys, both in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P22">In summary, we found that concurrent cutaneous nerve stimulation reduced peak-to-peak amplitude of afferent volleys, grey matter response fields and multiunit responses to proprioceptive stimuli. These results suggest that proprioceptive information processing may be disrupted by reducing both sensory input in the spinal cord as well as grey matter network computations.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Reduction of proprioceptive processing impacts somatosensory cortex</title><p id="P23">We showed that concurrent stimulation of cutaneous afferents suppresses proprioception information processing in the spinal cord and correlates to classic electrophysiology measures. We then hypothesized that this suppression in the spinal cord limits the amount of information transmitted upstream to the brain, which could impact conscious perception of proprioception.</p><p id="P24">To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intra-cortical neural signals extracted from area 2 of the somatosensory cortex in all four monkeys. We found cortical evoked potentials with a latency of around 22-25 ms, which is consistent with the longer distance between the cortex and the peripheral nerves and it has also been reported in similar experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Peak-to-peak analysis of the signal amplitude indicated similar results as in the spinal cord. We observed a reduction of proprioceptive evoked potentials during concurrent high amplitude stimulation of the cutaneous nerve in all monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Observed suppression was detected in most of the channels in the array. Moreover, when we stimulated the cutaneous nerve at a low amplitude, peak-to-peak values of the signal increased (muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation high amplitude, mean values difference: MK1: -8%, MK2: -19%, MK3: -30%, MK4: -29% ; muscle nerve stimulation vs muscle &amp; cutaneous nerve stimulation low amplitude: MK1: +2%, MK2: -18%, MK3: +3%, MK4: -26%).</p><p id="P26">Surprisingly, when we inspected the spiking activity extracted from multiunits in the cortex, the spike counts induced by concurrent cutaneous nerve stimulation at a low amplitude were similar, or even greater, than those obtained at a high amplitude (relative mean difference from concurrent high to low amplitude, +53.69% for MK1, -7.65% for MK2, +3.14% for MK3, -6.40% for MK4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This is markedly different from what we observed in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, S3</xref>). Indeed, we expected greater spiking activity consistently associated with higher stimulation amplitudes and not the opposite. In fact, this discrepancy seemed to reflect the spinal proprioceptive information processing, where concurrent cutaneous stimulation at a low amplitude yielded longer neural trajectory lengths.</p><p id="P27">In summary, we observed a reduction of proprioceptive information during concurrent continuous stimulation of the cutaneous nerve also in the somatosensory cortex. This finding suggests that the effects that we observed in the spinal cord propagate through the higher layers of sensorimotor processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">In this experimental study in four monkeys, we combined analysis of neural population dynamics with classical electrophysiology measures to analyze the impact of continuous electrical stimulation of the cutaneous afferents on the processing of proprioceptive information in the spinal cord. We found that the spinal sensorimotor computations of proprioceptive inputs were substantially disrupted when cutaneous afferents were concurrently stimulated and that this interference propagated to the brain. While limited to the stimulation of the cutaneous afferents, our findings suggest that artificially-generated neural input may disrupt ongoing neural processes that may be unrelated to the stimulation. More specifically, because of the highly shared neural architecture, even highly selective targeting of neural elements, like in our case the cutaneous afferents, can significantly undermine neural processing of seemingly unrelated neural functions, like proprioceptive percepts. Similar phenomena may occur in other regions of the nervous system and should therefore be studied. Hence, these results imply that efforts towards the development of naturalistic or biomimetic stimulation inputs should likely be employed in neurostimulation.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Population analysis as a tool to explain network-level effects of electrical stimulationz</title><p id="P29">Electrical stimulation of the nervous system is widely applied in clinical practice and in clinical research trials in order to influence neural activity and ameliorate functions in a variety of disorders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The most overt applications are sensorimotor neuroprostheses where a clear relationship can be found between stimulation parameters and strength of elicited movements(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) or evoked sensations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). For example, epidural spinal cord stimulation has been applied for both motor recovery as well as, more recently, for restoration of sensory feedback. We know that spinal cord stimulation recruits sensory afferents. In motor applications, the recruitment of large proprioceptive afferents leads to an increased excitability of spinal motoneurons, thereby promoting movement. Instead, in sensory applications, the recruitment of the same afferents should in principle produce controllable conscious sensory experiences, similar to those elicited by stimulation of the peripheral nerve. However, beyond this simplistic vision, there is a fundamental lack of knowledge into what happens to neural networks that receive inputs from these afferents. In fact, the highly shared neural infrastructures involve neural subnetworks that are meant to produce the desired function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). For instance, the motor network produces movement, but other networks may be involved in other unrelated processes such as perception, error estimation during movement execution and autonomic function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), among others(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). These additional sub-networks may also share inputs from the same afferents and would thus be perturbed by stimulation.</p><p id="P30">In our work, we constructed a toy model to study this specific problem in a controlled fashion as a proxy to understand, more generally, how artificial inputs can influence neural network function. We focused on the spinal network effects caused by stimulation of the cutaneous afferents on the neural processing of a proprioceptive pulse. This toy model exemplifies that an ongoing neural process (proprioceptive input processing) is perturbed when seemingly unrelated electrical stimuli application (inducing touch percepts) is applied with typical stimulation pattern (fixed 50Hz square pulses). To explore network effects, we used modern population analysis tools that enable the quantification of information processing in the spinal circuits via analysis of neural trajectories in the neural space(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Specifically, we established a measure of proprioceptive information processing by quantifying neural trajectory lengths in spinal neural manifolds using intra-spinal population analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Through the quantification of the trajectory length, we assessed the effect of concurrent cutaneous stimulation on the spinal proprioceptive information. We showed the collapse of proprioceptive neural trajectories during concurrent stimulation of cutaneous afferents, in other words, a suppression of proprioceptive information processed in the spinal cord, according to our interpretation. Importantly, simple analysis of total spike counts showed that the results of our trajectory length quantification were not trivial. Indeed, averaged multiunit spiking activity in response to proprioceptive stimuli were expectedly the highest during concurrent stimulation of the cutaneous afferents. This is an obvious result as general spinal activity is increased by the 50 Hz artificial cutaneous inputs. Thus, the actual total neural activity in the spinal cord is higher during cutaneous stimulation. Yet, the population analysis allows to extract only activity that explains the variance generated by proprioceptive inputs processes, enabling to infer the proprioceptive components of the neural dynamics against the background of cutaneous activity. Hence, the use of neural manifolds for population activity enabled the quantification of the stimulation effects on these computations.</p><p id="P31">We validated results obtained with neural manifold analysis with classical electrophysiology inspecting peak-to-peak amplitude of afferent volleys, spinal cord grey matter response fields and multiunit activity. These measures indicated a reduction in proprioceptive information during concurrent cutaneous stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Potential underlying neural mechanisms</title><p id="P32">While successful in visualizing network effects, population analysis cannot offer an explanatory value on the specific neural mechanisms responsible for this suppression. Pre-synaptic inhibition is a likely candidate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). It is a well-known mechanism of sensory input gating that prevents transmission of excitatory post-synaptic potentials to neurons targeted by primary afferents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). In our experiments, the stimulation amplitude of the muscle nerve was the same across all conditions (i.e., fixed number of recruited afferents). Therefore, the reduction of unit responses to proprioceptive inputs during concurrent cutaneous afferent stimulation could be consistent with a reduction in synaptic inputs to these target units.</p><p id="P33">Nevertheless, the observed afferent volley reduction was not strong enough to explain complete diminishment of proprioceptive perception, which means that the disruption of neural trajectories was not caused only by reduced inputs, but also by affected processing. We refer to this other potential mechanism as the “busy line” effect. Continuous, non-natural stimulation of the cutaneous afferents may produce highly synchronized activity in spinal circuits, which may receive both proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs. However, when artificially synchronized cutaneous inputs reach the spinal cord, they may saturate these circuits and reduce their capacity to respond to additional inputs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). When these neurons cannot be employed to process proprioceptive information, the neural network achieves a saturated state where no further processing can be carried out. This may explain why neural trajectories during cutaneous stimulation were displaced in the manifold space in a way that resembled a rigid geometric translation. Coincidentally, the modulated component of the neural dynamics was shorter or almost completely disrupted, suggesting that some of the neurons involved in performing the geometrical translation were not available to produce the modulated components of neural dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Effects within the brain</title><p id="P34">We performed a large part of our analysis in the spinal cord, which is the first important layer of sensory processing, particularly, in regard to proprioception. However, conscious perception is processed at various layers above the spinal cord. Indeed, peak-to-peak amplitudes of cortex potentials evoked with muscle nerve stimulation were suppressed when overlapped with cutaneous input also in the sensory cortex area 2, which is known to integrate cutaneous and proprioceptive inputs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Moreover, if cortical signals were independent from spinal and brainstem processes, when looking at the global cortical spike counts we would have expected higher spike counts during high-amplitude stimulation of the cutaneous nerve and lower spiking activity during low amplitude stimulation of the cutaneous nerve. Instead, we found higher or similar spiking activity when we used low-amplitude stimulation of the cutaneous nerve. This may be indicative of the fact that high amplitude stimulation may convey more cutaneous input but less proprioceptive input to the cortex because of sub-cortical cancellation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In contrast, cutaneous stimulation at a lower amplitude may mean less cutaneous input but more proprioceptive input to the cortex as a consequence of less cancellation occurring in sub-cortical structures. Nevertheless, these mechanistic conjunctures are strongly contingent on our experimental design. Future directions ought to design alternative experimental paradigms (i.e., including histological analysis) that uncover the spinal interneuron circuitry involved in the processing of proprioceptive information in response to concurrent input.</p><p id="P35">These overall results support the conclusion that conscious perception of proprioception may be also altered by sub-cortical interference. While this hypothesis cannot be tested in subjects with amputation because of their limb loss, recent data in humans with sensory incomplete spinal cord injury shows that spinal cord stimulation, which also recruits sensory afferents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), reduces proprioception acuity during supra-threshold stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This result in humans further supports our hypothesis and we believe that it demands further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Conclusions and relevance for other brain circuits</title><p id="P36">Our results showed that electrical stimulation of sensory afferents can alter the processing of proprioceptive information within spinal circuits. Similar phenomena may occur in brain networks during deep brain stimulation, where similar continuous electrical pulses are delivered to thalamocortical projections and other large brain networks. In the brain, these effects, which in the spinal cord indicate the impossibility to appropriately process proprioception, could potentially alter cognitive processes unrelated to the stimulation goals within the cortex. A potential approach to minimize the interference of stimulation with ongoing neural processes is the use of “bio-mimetic” and model-based stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Instead of delivering unstructured and synchronized neural activity, they could produce more naturalistic patterns, thereby potentially avoiding these side effects. In conclusion, future stimulation strategies designs should consider the use of neural population analysis in order to analyze the effects of particular stimulation patterns on apparently unrelated neural network processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals</title><p id="P37">The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local (Research Institute of Medical Primatology) Institutional Ethics Committee (protocol № 38/1, October 31, 2019) and by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Research Protections and IACUC (ISOOO17081).</p><p id="P38">Three adult Macaca Fascicularis and one Macaca Mulatta monkeys were involved in the study (MK1 - MK 42286, male, 4 years old, 3.5 kg, MK2 - MK 42588, male, 4 years old, 3.35 kg, MK4 - MK 42328, male, 4 years old, 3.48 kg; MK3 – 219-21, male, 7 years old, 11.5 kg).

Throughout the procedures, the veterinary team continuously monitored the animal’s heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation level and temperature. Surgical implantations were performed during a single operation lasting approximately 8 hours. We fixed monkeys’ heads in a stereotaxic frame securing the cervical spine in a prone and flat position. First, we implanted two silicon cuff electrodes (Microprobes for Life Science, Gaithersburg, MD 20879, U.S.A. and Micro-Leads, Somerville, MA 02144, U.S.A.) on the distal ends of the superficial branch and deep branch of radial nerve that we determined via anatomical landmarks. We then inserted EMG electrodes in the Extensor Digit. Communis, the Flexor Carpi Radialis and the Flexor Digit. Superficialis. We stimulated electrically two branches of the radial nerve and looked at the EMG response to verify which branch was the muscle branch and which one was the cutaneous branch. Second, we implanted the brain array using a pneumatic insertion system (Blackrock Microsystem). We performed a craniotomy and we incised the dura in order to get clear access to the central sulcus. We identified motor and sensory brain areas through anatomical landmarks and intra-surgical micro-stimulation.

We implanted the arrays using MM-3 micromanipulators (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan; David Koff Instruments for the Mulatta monkey). Experiments in all four monkeys were terminal.

We calculated the spiking activity for every 100 ms with a sliding window of 10 ms over 430 ms around each muscle stimulation pulse. We zero-padded the first repetition for 90 ms and then overlapped 90ms from the previous repetition for the rest of repetitions. The final step to smooth the spiking activity was the application of a Gaussian kernel (s.d. 20 ms) to the binned square-root-transformed firings (10 ms bin size) of each recorded multiunit. For each condition, this resulted in a matrix of dimensions C x T, where C is the number of channels in the dorso-ventral linear probe and T is the number of 10 ms windows in a repetition concatenated for all the repetitions within a condition. Subsequently, we proceed to eliminate noisy repetitions. We discarded those repetitions within each condition whose s.d. was greater than twice the total s.d. across all repetitions plus the total mean of the s.d. across all repetitions for that condition. For cortical data, we previously converted the distribution of s.d. to a lognormal distribution to apply this outlier cleaning rule.</p><p id="P50">To calculate the latent dynamics for each monkey, we z-scored each condition’s spiking activity before applying dimensionality reduction principal component analysis (PCA) to the concatenated spike counts. We selected the first 3 principal components that explained most of the variance (~65% for all 3 monkeys, 54% for one monkey) as neural modes to define the neural manifold. Convergence points were reached at the first 3 to 5 dimensions according to the eigenspectrum of each monkey. In this low dimensionality space, we proceeded by eliminating repetitions as a function of the distance to the median trajectory. In particular, we computed the median trajectory for each 10 ms window for each condition. For each window, we calculated the distance between the median trajectory and the trajectory elicited by each repetition within a condition. 25th and 75th percentiles of the obtained distances allowed to discard trajectories whose distance was greater than the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range of the averaged trajectory for that repetition across all 10 ms windows. The same criterion was applied for the lower range. Finally, we quantified the trajectory length for the remaining repetitions for each condition and calculated the average trajectory length across all 10 ms windows.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P51">Multi-group significance comparison of data obtained from the neural manifold for each condition in all four monkeys was tested using Kruskal-Wallis test.

a desired neural function (Function A, B, respectively) within a highly shared neural architecture.

Top, naturally-generated neural activity of unrelated neural functions successfully processes ongoing information input throughout the shared neural architecture. Bottom, artificially-generated neural activity targeted to restore Function B (magenta) artificially processes information input, while impairing information processing from an unrelated neural function (Function A, cyan). Specifically, artificially-induced processing in the shared processing nodes concurrently hinders computations of unrelated ongoing processing of Function B, which may also be unselectively recruited by the electrical stimulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS176017-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Experimental setup: Schematic illustration of experiments.</title><p>a) Stimulation: we implanted two nerve cuffs for stimulation on the superficial branch (cutaneous nerve) and the deep branch (muscle nerve) of the radial nerve.

Each color represents the neural activity recorded by each channel. Right, dimensionality reduction technique identifies the neural modes that define the low-dimensional spaces. In these subspaces, the neural activity followed precise dynamics. We hypothesized that b) a muscle nerve stimulation pulse elicits neural trajectories and that c) these neural trajectories shrink as a function of the stimulation amplitude. d) Top, averaged multiunit spike counts across all 32 channels, sorted by the highest spiking activity after the muscle nerve stimulation, for MK1. Bottom, resultant 10-trial averaged neural trajectories elicited by muscle nerve stimulation for MK1.
