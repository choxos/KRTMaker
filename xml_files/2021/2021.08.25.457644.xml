<abstract>
<p id="P1">The development of more effective, accessible and easy to administer COVID-19 vaccines next to the currently marketed mRNA, viral vector and whole inactivated virus vaccines, is essential to curtain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, development of a vaccine against this emerging pathogen has been given the highest priority globally. The first vaccine, a mRNA vaccine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, entered the market with unprecedented speed early December 2020<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Soon other mRNA, viral vector and whole inactivated vaccines followed. All COVID-19 vaccines on the market today and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Although the current vaccines protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, efficacy wanes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, the development of additional vaccines aims to broaden and strengthen the immune response because of concerns about reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, the fact that many people in large parts of the world do not have access to vaccines yet, and there is still limited knowledge on the longevity of current vaccine responses.</p>
<p id="P3">Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce not only systemic but also local mucosal immunity. In view of the respiratory tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a vaccine delivered intranasally, able to elicit mucosal immunity directly at the port of entry of the virus and preventing transmission, would be desirable<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Mucosal protection is the first line of defense in the human body against respiratory pathogens, and intranasal antigen delivery is associated with induction of mucosal immunity including production of IgA antibodies and the priming of T cells in nasal tissues. Furthermore, intranasal administration is a needle-free vaccination route which could aid in mass vaccination campaigns by increasing the ease and speed, by decreasing costs and reducing pain associated with vaccination. Currently only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are intranasally administered and only two of those are subunit vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. The other intranasal vaccines in clinical development are mainly vector vaccines for which there is a risk that pre-existing immunity against the vector can impair the magnitude of the elicited immune response after vaccination or booster vaccination. The vaccine concept described here is an intranasal subunit vaccine containing recombinant spike protein and based on outer membrane vesicle (OMV) platform technology.</p>
<p id="P4">OMVs can bud off spontaneously from the cell surface of many Gram-negative bacteria and are non-infectious vesicles. They present surface antigens in a form that is efficiently recognized by the immune system and activate innate immunity through the presence of multiple PAMPS like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoproteins. Because of their strong immunogenicity, OMVs have been explored extensively as vaccine candidates, especially in the case of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis.</italic> We have optimized the meningococcal OMV platform to tailor it for safe and effective use in humans. By combining genetically detoxified <italic>lpxL1</italic> LPS with deletion of the <italic>rmpM</italic> gene to increase blebbing, high yield production and isolation of native OMV with reduced endotoxicity became possible. In multiple clinical and non-clinical toxicity and immunogenicity studies OMVs were successfully tested and proven safe and effective<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Meningococcal OMVs can also be applied as a carrier or adjuvant for antigens from other pathogens. Previously we have demonstrated how expression of the OspA lipoprotein from <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> on meningococcal OMV could be used to induce protection against borreliosis in a mouse model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. However, this application requires efficient expression of heterologous antigens in OMV, which is not always feasible as it requires compatibility with the bacterial outer membrane biogenesis machinery. As an alternative, recombinant antigens can be produced separately, and externally linked to the OMVs, enabling the use of OMV as a carrier and adjuvant for the e.g. the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
<p id="P5">The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is found in prefusion conformation on infectious virions and in this form the protein displays most of the neutralizing epitopes that can be targeted by antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> to prevent the entry process mediated by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. The ACE2 receptor on the host cell recognizes the RBD and mediates the structural transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. McLellan and coworkers rapidly developed a prefusion stabilized spike protein (S-2P), by introducing a double-proline substitution in the S2 domain of the spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> to aid vaccine design. Several of the first vaccines developed, like the mRNA vaccines mRNA-1273<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> and BNT162b2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> use the S-2P in their vaccine designs. An improved prefusion stabilized spike protein, HexaPro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, was developed combining four additional proline substitutions into S-2P. Hexapro showed increased stability, higher expression in mammalian cells, proper conformation, thus preserving its antigenicity and a third of the particles were found to be in a two-RBD-up conformation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Hexapro is thus an ideal target to be included in the design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p>
<p id="P6">In the present study, we developed an innovative subunit vaccine for COVID-19 in which a HexaPro spike protein containing the D614G mutation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> is associated to OMV, that serve as a carrier and adjuvant for the spike molecule, using the short amphipathic peptide sequence mCRAMP fused to the C-terminus. Both mCRAMP as well as its human orthologue LL-37 are short amphipathic peptides that belong to the cathelicidins, vertebrate host defense peptides defined by their conserved pro-region<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>, and have a strong binding affinity for LPS. The interaction with LPS is through negative phosphate groups in lipid A and the inner core oligosaccharide, and the positively charged region of LL-37 or mCRAMP, which is followed by membrane insertion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. We have used this LPS-binding property to direct a recombinant Spike-mCRAMP fusion protein to associate with OMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">The immunogenicity of the OMV linked HexaPro spike vaccine concept was tested in a mouse model after administration via the intranasal route and intramuscular route. Although the mouse model is not the preferred model to study efficacy, as mice are not susceptible for infection with SARS-CoV-2, this model provides a good read-out on immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines. Subsequently for measuring protection, a Syrian hamster model was used in which animals were challenged with wildtype SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination and again both the intranasal and intramuscular routes were compared. In this hamster model we show protection of throat and lungs against respiratory COVID infection by our OMV-based non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. In addition to the 3xGGGS spacer and mCRAMP sequence, the aspartic acid at position 614 in the original HexaPro spike protein was replaced with a glycine (D614G).

<title>Meningococcal carrier strain construction</title>
<p id="P9">Starting material for strain construction was <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> HI5, a spontaneous <italic>porA</italic> deletion mutant of strain H44/76<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. A spontaneous mutant resistant to streptomycin was isolated so that the strain became amenable for the use of a marker-free mutagenesis technique<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Strep<sup>R</sup> mutants were selected by plating H44/76 ∆<italic>porA</italic> cells on GC medium containing 500 μg/ml Strep. Sequencing of their <italic>rpsL</italic> gene showed that they contained amino acid change K88R compared to the starting material, a mutation known to confer streptomycin resistance in other bacteria. The marker-free method is based on two-step selection/counterselection of a cassette that confers erythromycin resistance (Ery<sup>R</sup>) and streptomycin sensitivity (Strep<sup>S</sup>). For the first step, a 1<sup>st</sup> crossover construct was designed consisting of the Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette, flanked by DNA bordering the region to be replaced in the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> genome. A DUS sequence is added to ensure uptake of the DNA. For the counterselection step, a 2<sup>nd</sup> crossover construct was designed identical to the 1<sup>st</sup> crossover construct, except that the Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette is deleted. Positive transformants that carry the Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette in their genome were subjected to transformation with linearized plasmid carrying the 2<sup>nd</sup> crossover construct. Selection for streptomycin resistance then resulted in the isolation of cells that have lost their genomic Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette as a result of recombination between linearized plasmid and the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> genome. Using this technique, three deletions were introduced. The <italic>siaD</italic> gene was deleted, which results in loss of capsule and increased safety for laboratory handling. Subsequently, the <italic>lpxL1</italic> gene was deleted, resulting in penta-acylated lipid A and less reactogenic LPS. Last, the <italic>rmpM</italic> gene was deleted, which results in increased blebbing and higher OMV yields. After construction was finished, the final strain (renamed as Nm RL∆pA) was analyzed for the presence of the correct mutations by sequencing.</p>
<p id="P10">Linearized plasmids containing the 1<sup>st</sup> crossover constructs were transformed into <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> H44/76 (∆<italic>porA</italic>, Strep<sup>R</sup>, with previously introduced mutations) by adding ~1 μg plasmid to a cell suspension of OD590 nm = 0.2 in vTSB (Fluka) with 0.1M MgCl2. Successful transformants were selected on GC-agar (BBL) supplemented with IsoVitaleX (BBL) and 5 μg/ml Ery. For the second step (deletion of the Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette), linearized plasmid containing the 2<sup>nd</sup> crossover construct was added, and bacteria were plated on GC + 500 μg/ml Strep to select Strep<sup>R</sup> clones no longer containing the Ery<sup>R</sup>-Strep<sup>S</sup> cassette as a result of double crossover between the genome and the 2<sup>nd</sup> crossover construct. Colonies with the correct antibiotic resistance phenotype (Ery<sup>S</sup> and Strep<sup>R</sup>) were then further verified by PCR.</p>

<p id="P11">
<italic>N. meningitidis</italic> OMVs were produced using our downscaled platform production process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Bacteria were precultured from cryovials in 155 ml chemically defined medium in a 500-ml shake flask at 35°C and 200 rpm. At exponential phase of the cells at OD590 nm of ~1.8, the whole preculture was transferred to a 5L single-use bioreactor (Eppendorf BioBlu3f) containing a total of 3.2L medium volume. The culture conditions were controlled (Eppendorf BioFlo320) and monitored at 35°C, pH7.2 by addition of 1M NaOH and 1M HCl. The dissolved oxygen tension was controlled at 30% by a headspace total flow aeration of 1L/min air and by increasing the stirrer speed (300-1000rpm) followed by replacing air by pure oxygen. Both oxygen and carbon dioxide percentages were analyzed in the off gas. The culture was harvested after ~16 hours of cultivation, and two hours after the maximum Carbon Dioxide Evolution Rate (CER) resulting in an OD590 nm of 9. The culture in the bioreactor was cooled to 20°C before starting the concentration with a 790cm2 mPES hollow fiber with a 0.45μm pore size using the KMPi TFF system (Repligen). The concentrated biomass was diafiltrated with two Diafiltration Volumes (2DV) with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. Afterwards, 10 mM EDTA in 0.1M Tris pH 8.6 was added to the biomass to start the extraction for 30 minutes at ambient temperature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. The extracted OMVs were separated from the biomass by high-speed centrifugation (30 min, 23,500xg). The supernatant containing the crude OMVs was transferred to a bottle and treated overnight at ambient temperature with 100U DNAse (Benzonase) and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to digest residual DNA. The OMVs were clarified by an Opticap SHC 0.5/0.2 μm pore size Poly Ether Sulfone (PES) depth filter to remove potential aggregates. Group separation was performed by Size Exclusion Chromatography on a XK50 Sepharose 4 FF column (Cytiva) and controlled by an Akta GE system. The eluent was 10 mM Tris/3% sucrose, pH 7.4. The OMV fraction was sterile filtered using a Supor EKV dead-end filter with 0.2 μm pore size and stored at 2-8°C.</p>

<title>Hamster challenge study</title>
<p id="P23">As mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we next studied protection against viral challenge in the hamster model. Syrian hamsters were immunized with either purified mC-Spike protein or OMV-mC-Spike, with Tris-sucrose or empty OMVs as controls. The experimental setup and timelines of the experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. High IgG antibody responses against spike were seen after immunization with OMV-mC-Spike for both the intranasal and intramuscular routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was reflected in the virus neutralization titers which were also only detected in these same groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, almost no lung lesions were detected in the OMV-mC-Spike groups, while mC-Spike protein alone also provide significant protection compared to OMV or Tris-sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). OMVs alone did not provide any protection, showing that generalized innate immune activation by the OMVs did not play a role. The viral load determined in throat swabs, lungs and nasal turbinates showed the highest reduction in the OMV-mC-Spike group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Vaccination was safe as the weight of the hamsters till the day of challenge was comparable for all groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). After challenge the weight reduction was significantly lower for the OMV-mC-Spike group as compared to the Tris-sucrose control and the Spike protein-immunized hamsters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>). The sum of lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease parameters as determined by gross pathology was highly reduced after intramuscular vaccination with OMV-mC-Spike, whereas after intranasal vaccination with OMV-mC-Spike no disease parameters were scored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>). Overall, these data showed clear protection after both intranasal and intramuscular immunization with OMV-mC-Spike.

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p id="P25">Here we describe the assessment of safety, immunogenicity and protective capacity of OMV-mC-Spike, a COVID-19 vaccine consisting of HexaPro spike that is associated with OMVs from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> via a short amphipathic peptide sequence, mCRAMP, in mice and Syrian hamsters. Both intranasal and intramuscular delivery of OMV-mC-Spike induced a strong humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen in a 2 dose regimen. Throughout the study no adverse events were recorded in the animals, supporting the safety of the vaccine. After challenge of the hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 a clear reduction in viral loads and no lung disease burden was observed, supporting the protective capacity of OMV-mC-Spike.</p>
<p id="P26">All COVID-19 vaccines currently in use are administered intramuscularly, which mainly induces a systemic antibody response. However, mucosal administration of vaccines has several advantages. In general, benefits of needle-free administration include easier administration, absence of sharp waste, and convenience for the vaccinee. In addition, mucosal vaccination provides a rational reason to induce a protective immune response against pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, that infect humans via mucosal surfaces<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, with respect to the immune response, different types of immune cells are activated in the mucosa, leading to a different type of both innate and adaptive immune response with a major role for IgA antibodies in the latter. IgA antibodies have several useful characteristics. For example, IgA antibodies can neutralize pathogens even before they pass the mucosal barrier, because the secretory form is transported across the epithelium. Moreover secretory IgA antibodies are polymeric, usually a dimer, which is more effective in neutralizing pathogens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, which might reduce carriage in the nose. For example, intranasal but not intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine reduced shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, in contrast to IgG antibodies, IgA antibodies do not activate the complement pathway thereby limiting the induction of inflammatory responses and with respect to influenza IgA antibodies are known to be cross-protective across different strains<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P27">For SARS-CoV-2 the role of IgA antibodies and mucosal responses in general have been less intensively investigated. However, development of a mucosal vaccine is also thought to be a promising approach in the case of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, since vaccination at the entry point can induce a strong local as well as systemic immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Similarly to earlier findings with influenza viruses, among the induced antibodies in serum and saliva of COVID-19 patients, IgA antibodies contributed more to virus neutralization than IgG<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. Intranasal, but not intramuscular, vaccination with OMV-mC-Spike indeed induced a high local IgA antibody response in the nose and in the lungs. Both intranasal and intramuscular vaccination with OMV-mC-Spike clearly reduced viral replication in the lungs after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Several mucosal vaccines for humans on the market or in late stage clinical trials use live-attenuated viruses, including an oral polio vaccine (OPV), an intranasal influenza (FluMist) and a COVID-19 vaccine (COVI-VAC). As <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> is adapted to live in the human nasopharynx, it can efficiently interact with host cells in this site through its cell surface components, and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> derived OMVs will mimic these steps making them particularly suitable for mucosal vaccination. As our OMV-based vaccine induced both local and systemic IgA antibody responses after intranasal but not intramuscular vaccination in mice, it is possible that it will not only protect against disease, but also against infection with COVID-19 thereby preventing transmission and the occurrence of variants. Intranasal vaccines can also give rise to resident memory T and B cells, thus providing additional protection against local viral replication and transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P28">The results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using the OMV platform for development of intranasal vaccines for infectious diseases and outbreaks by externally linking antigens to the OMV. Advantages of this platform are first of all the scalability of OMV production, as bacteria replicate rapidly, and the strains were genetically modified to produce a high amount of OMV. Due to the genetic detoxification of the LPS mild extraction processes of the OMV are feasible. The developed process also retains lipoproteins on the OMVs to further stimulate the immune response. Using standard filtration steps that are scalable the OMVs can be manufactured to high purity. An efficient large-scale bioreactor production process including downstream purification has been established<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, OMVs are extremely stable at 2-8 °C and even elevated temperatures, and can be stockpiled, so in case of an outbreak of a pathogen, large batches of OMV can be quickly used for linking of antigens of the pathogen. Also, the platform is highly versatile, as different types of antigens, like proteins, peptides or sugars can be linked to OMVs.</p>
<p id="P29">In both the mouse and hamster model, virus-neutralizing antibodies are induced when the spike protein is combined with OMVs. In the hamster model, almost no lung lesions are found after challenge when vaccination was done with spike protein combined with OMVs. Adding a C-terminal mCRAMP tag to associate the spike protein with the OMVs increases the protective response in both models compared to mixing spike with OMVs. Overall, these data show that (i) Neisseria OMVs are an effective adjuvant/delivery system for the COVID-19 Spike protein, and (ii) increasing OMV association by an mCRAMP tag improves the protective response.</p>
<p id="P30">When using OMVs as delivery system for heterologous antigens, an important consideration is whether the antigen needs to be incorporated in the vesicles, or if just mixing is sufficient. A priori one could argue that association is advantageous, as antigens and OMVs will be taken up and processed by antigen-presenting cells simultaneously, thereby preventing induction of premature differentiation by OMVs before sufficient antigen is taken up. A study with tumor antigens and E.coli-derived OMVs showed that co-delivery was indeed more effective in inducing anti-tumor immunity in a mouse model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. Our previous results with the Borrelia OspA protein showed that both methods gave significant protection against Borrelia challenge in mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. However, OspA is a lipoprotein and may therefore spontaneously associate to some extent with OMVs through its N-terminal lipidation anchor. Our present results with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein show that noncovalent OMV association through the mCRAMP tag is advantageous for the resulting immune response.</p>
<p id="P31">OMVs closely mimic the bacterial pathogens from which they are derived, and have been shown to confer a bactericidal immune response against <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. Although mainly used by the intramuscular route, the size of OMVs is in the range thought to be most effective to cross the mucus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> and meningococcal OMVs have also been shown to induce a bactericidal response after intranasal application<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. Salmonella-derived OMVs carrying the pneumococcal antigen PspA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup> induced strong Th17-mediated immunity in mice after intranasal vaccination, leading to reduced pneumococcal colonization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Intranasal immunization of mice with <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> OMVs induced mucosal IgA and Th17-mediated responses which prevented colonization of the nasal cavity and the lungs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. OMVs derived from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have recently also been used to present respectively the spike RBD or peptides derived from it, and in both cases immunization provided a protective response in animal models<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. In our OMV-mC-Spike vaccine the full length spike protein is included. It has been shown previously that vaccination with S1 induced higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than RBD alone and these antibodies more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2, suggesting many neutralizing epitopes are located in the S1 region and not only in RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. Another study compared several spike variants, including RBD, S1, S2 and full length spike, and showed that full length spike generated a higher neutralizing-to-binding ratio indicating immunization with the full protein induced more neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P32">A significant limitation for the use of viral vector-based vaccines is the development of anti-vector immunity, which restricts the number of possible booster vaccinations. With OMV based vaccines we assume this is less of an issue, as they are non-replicating and do not depend on a specific host receptor for cellular entry. In addition, major antigens can be removed by gene deletion, as we did with the immunodominant PorA outer membrane protein in our vaccine strain, thus limiting the response against neisserial antigens. OMV-spike vaccination might thus also find an application as a heterologous boost after primary vaccination with viral vector-based vaccines.</p>
<p id="P33">Overall, here we show that OMV-mC-Spike is safe and effective in both mice and hamsters. In these animal models, intranasal vaccination with OMV-mC-Spike is superior to intramuscular vaccination, since the amount of IgG induced is higher and in addition a strong mucosal response is induced. Our study demonstrates that adding an mCRAMP tag to the Spike protein and combining it with meningococcal OMVs improves its immunogenicity, thus warranting further development of this vaccine concept towards clinical trials in humans.</p>

<title>Schematic presentation of the spike molecule and OMV decoration with spike.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of 2019-nCoV S primary structure colored by domain. S, signal sequence; NTD: N-terminal domain; RBD: Receptor Binding Domain; FP: fusion peptide; HR1-HR2: heptad repeat 1 and 2; FC: disrupted S1/S2 furin cleavage site (R682G, R684S, R685S). Features that were added to the ectodomain (amino acid 1-1208) expression construct are colored white gray gradient (amino acid 1209-1333). From light to dark gray: Foldon trimerization motif (F); HRV 3C site; 8xHis tag; Twin Strep tag; 3x GGGS repeat; mCramp (mC). Not shown: Six stabilizing prolines in S2 at position F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P, V987P<sup>

</sup> spike protein was replaced with a glycine (D614G). (B) schematic overview of how antigens can associate to the OMVs. In the spike protein an mCRAMP (antimicrobial peptide) motif was included which is depicted in light blue. This peptide associates spontaneously to the LPS of the OMV thereby attaching the spike protein (dark blue) to the OMV.</p>

<title>Mouse immunogenicity study.</title>
<p>Balb/C mice were immunized intranasally or intramuscular on day 0 and day 21 with 15μg OMV (control group) or 15 μg OMV combined with 15μg Spike with the presence of mCRAMP or without mCRAMP (OMV+Spike). Sera were collected from all animals at day 35. (A) Experimental setup and timeline of the mouse immunogenicity experiment. (B) Total IgG antibody levels were measured in sera diluted at 1:50000. (C) IgA levels were measured in nasal washes (1:1 dilution), lung (1:50 dilution) and serum (1:200 dilution). (D) Virus neutralization titers were determined in sera. Data are depicted as mean ± SD and are representative results of two independent experiments.</p>

<title>Hamster challenge study.</title>
<p>Animals were immunized intranasally or intramuscularly on day 0 and day 21 with 15 μg OMV, 15 μg spike or 15 μg OMV and 15 μg Spike combined with mCRAMP. In the control group animals were immunized with 10mM Tris-3% sucrose, which is the OMV buffer. Sera were collected from all hamsters at experimental day 0, 21, 42, 46 and 49. At day 42, all hamsters were challenged intranasally with 10^4.0 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, strain BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020. At day 46 half of the animals per group (4 out of 8) were sacrificed and at day 49 the remaining 4 animals were sacrificed. (A) Experimental setup and timeline of the hamster challenge experiment. (B) Total IgG anti-spike antibody levels were measured in sera (dilution 1:4000) from day 42 in an ELISA. (C) Virus neutralization was determined in sera from day 42. (D) When animals were sacrificed at day 46 (day 4 post challenge) and day 49 (day 7 post challenge) the percentage of the lung that presented lung lesions was quantified. The viral load was determined in throat swabs (E), lungs and nasal turbinates (F). Data are depicted as mean ± SD.</p>
