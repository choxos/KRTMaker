<abstract>
<p id="P1">Vaccine boosters and infection can facilitate the development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with improved potency and breadth. Here, we observed super-immunity in a camelid extensively immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We rapidly isolated a large repertoire of specific ultrahigh-affinity nanobodies that bind strongly to all known sarbecovirus clades using integrative proteomics. These pan- sarbecovirus nanobodies (psNbs) are highly effective against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Omicron, with the best median neutralization potency at single-digit ng/ml. Structural determinations of 13 psNbs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD revealed five epitope classes, providing insights into the mechanisms and evolution of their broad activities. The highly evolved psNbs target small, flat, and flexible epitopes that contain over 75% of conserved RBD surface residues. Their potencies are strongly and negatively correlated with the distance of the epitopes to the receptor binding sites. A highly potent, inhalable and bispecific psNb (PiN-31) was developed. Our findings inform on the development of broadly protective vaccines and therapeutics.</p>

<p id="P2">SARS-related coronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are among the most pressing threats to global health. The high genetic diversity, frequent recombination, large natural reservoirs, and proximity to heavily populated areas across continents, underlie the recurrent zoonotic risks of sarbecoviruses and other circulating coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop broad, effective, and complementary interventions against the currently evolving pandemic as well as future threats. Emerging evidence indicates that B cells isolated from convalescent and infected-then-vaccinated individuals continue to evolve, producing antibodies with increased potency against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Most antibodies target the spike RBD, which dominates immunogenicity and neutralizing activities of convalescent and vaccinated sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Only a small number of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the large sarbecovirus family have been successfully isolated with varied breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Moreover, an understanding of the full dynamic repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies and mechanisms that shape SARS-CoV-2 super-immunity is still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">By camelid immunization and proteomics, we recently identified thousands of high-affinity RBD nanobodies (Nbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Most ultrapotent Nbs bind the highly variable human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor-binding sites (RBS) and are therefore less effective against evolving variants. Here, we found that, after immune boosters with recombinant RBD<sup>SARS-CoV-2</sup>, serum V<sup>H</sup>H antibodies evolved with substantially improved activities not only against the variants of concern (VOCs) but also to a broad spectrum of sarbecoviruses. To understand the broad serologic activities, we isolated and systematically characterized 100 high-affinity pan-sarbecovirus nanobodies (psNbs) with superior potency and breadth and developed an ultrapotent, bispecific and aerosolizable psNb (PiN-31). Structural determinations of 13 diverse psNbs with the spike or RBD by cryoEM and X-ray crystallography revealed five classes with marked diversity within dominant classes. Our analysis offers insights into the remarkable evolution of serologic responses towards broad activity against sarbecoviruses.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Identification and characterization of a large repertoire of potent pan-sarbecovirus Nbs</title>
<p id="P4">A llama was initially immunized with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc fusion protein and the initial bleed was collected approximately 2 months after priming and three boosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). We then re-immunized with four additional boosts for 2 months before the booster bleed was collected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>). The polyclonal V<sub>H</sub>H mixture of the booster bleed showed higher affinity to RBD<sub>SARS-CoV-2</sub> (ELISA IC<sub>50</sub>s of 43 pM) compared to that of the initial bleed (IC<sub>50</sub> of 130 pM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>). The V<sub>H</sub>H mixture also maintained excellent neutralization potency (IC<sub>50</sub>s between 0.3-0.6 nM) against the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain as well as Alpha and Lambda VOCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B</xref>. Notably, compared to the initial V<sup>H</sup>Hs, the neutralization potencies after booster were substantially increased to Beta, Delta and SARS-CoV (IC<sub>50</sub>s of 0.58, 1.90 and 1.65 nM, respectively) corresponding to 6.0, 2.3, and 9.3 fold improvements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B</xref>). Surprisingly, the booster was also associated with strong and broad activities against the full spectrum of sarbecoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The relative binding affinities (ELISA IC<sub>50</sub>s) for RBDs from clade 1a (RBD<sub>SARS-CoV</sub>), 2 (RBD<sub>RmYN02-CoV</sub>), and 3 (RBD<sub>BM-4831-CoV</sub>) were 0.08, 0.09, and 0.14 nM, respectively, which correspond to 8.5, 7.2, and 8.6 fold improvements over the initial bleed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Next, we employed quantitative Nb proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) to identify high-affinity psNbs that confer broad-spectrum activity in immunized sera (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). This technology rapidly identified hundreds of distinct CDR3 families, from which a fraction of highly divergent Nbs were expressed and characterized. A total of 100 Nbs that interacted strongly with RBDSARS-CoV-2 (Clade 1b) were confirmed to cross-react with other sarbecovirus clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Of these, 23%, 35%, and 42% were found to bind two, three, and all four sarbecovirus clades, respectively. Consistent with total polyclonal V<sup>H</sup>H activity, psNbs isolated from the booster show broader pan-sarbecovirus activity than the initial bleed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2B</xref>). A substantial fraction (42%) was able to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 below 500 nM, with the best IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 ng/ml (77 pM, 2-67), and a median of 0.25 μg/ml (17 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Network analysis revealed that the psNbs are dominated by multiple clusters that span a large spectrum of physicochemical properties including isoelectric point (pI) and hydropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A</xref>). The three largest clusters are each composed of potent neutralizers (with the best IC<sub>50</sub> of 6.8 ng/ml) that bind strongly to at least three sarbecovirus clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). A smaller cluster (represented by 2-62 and 2-63) showed broad activity, yet only weakly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub>s between 40 -132 μg/ml, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6</xref>). Other small clusters represented by 2-19, 2-16, 2-3 and 2-24 did not show neutralization at up to 37.5 μg/ml.</p>
<p id="P6">The psNbs were further classified by epitope binning using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). psNb-RBDSARS-CoV-2 complexes were competed with high-affinity benchmark Nbs (Nb21, Nb105, and Nb36) that bind distinct and well-characterized epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). psNbs fall into five groups: group A (3%) competes with Nb21 and targets RBS, group B (33%) with Nb105, group C (9%) with Nb36, and group D (17%) does not compete with any benchmark Nbs. Approximately one third of psNbs (Group E, 38%) bind strongly to RBDs based on ELISA, but do not neutralize pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 efficiently. We selected a high-affinity psNb (2-47) from group E and confirmed its strong binding to the fully glycosylated but not the de-glycosylated RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). It is possible that 2-47 can target an epitope encompassing the conserved, glycosylated RBD residue(s) (e.g., N343) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that a large cohort of high-affinity and divergent psNbs targeting multiple dominant RBD epitopes contribute to the broad-spectrum serologic activities.</p>
<p id="P7">17 psNbs spanning four SEC groups (A-D) were tested for binding to RBDs of five SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the fast-spreading Omicron, and other 18 different sarbecovirus RBDs. These psNbs bind strongly to all variants that were evaluated. 16 of the 17 psNbs bind to all four clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, seven psNbs (such as 2-31 and 2-45) have exceptionally broad activities and bind strongly to all 24 RBDs with a median ELISA IC<sub>50</sub> of 3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Two representative psNbs were measured for binding kinetics to all four clades by SPR. The K<sub>D</sub>s of 2-31 for RBD<sub>SARS-CoV-2</sub> (Clade 1b), RBD<sub>SARS-CoV</sub> (clade 1a), RBD<sub>RmYN02-CoV</sub> (clade 2), RBD<sub>BM-4831-CoV</sub> (clade 3) are &lt;1 pM, 3.96 pM, 0.59 nM and 3.60 nM, respectively(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). The binding of 2-45 is equally strong for clades 1b, 2 and 3 (0.39 nM, 1.4 nM and 44 pM,respectively) and more moderate for clade 1a (304 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>). Of note, these psNbs are highly specific to sarbecoviruses and do not cross-react with a human whole protein extract at high concentrations (up to 8 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">All but one of these 17 psNbs can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, based on a pseudovirus assay, and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) against the Munich strain and Delta VOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Group A Nb 2-67, which preferentially binds to clade 1b, is extremely potent for SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs with a median neutralization potency of 1.2 ng/ml. Group C (1-22, 2-10 and 2-45) neutralizes VOCs at single-digit μg/ml, but is less effective against SARS-CoV. 2-63 (group D) has exceptional breath while the other group D psNb 2-28 has limited breadth. Both weakly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> 7- 132 μg/ml). The remaining psNbs belong to group B and show comparably high potency against SARS-CoV. The median potency for SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs is 86 ng/ml with the most potent (2-55) at 6 ng/ml. Notably, psNbs are usually highly stable and can withstand aerosolization without compromising activity as exemplified by 2-31 and 2-45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). To demonstrate the high bioengineering potentials of psNbs, we developed a bispecific construct (PiN-31) by fusing these two potent and broad-spectrum psNbs, which cover two distinct epitopes based on SEC. Compared to the monomers, the potency of PiN-31 improves by an order of magnitude to 0.4 nM based on the PRNT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>Diversity, convergence and evolution of broadly neutralizing psNbs</title>
<p id="P9">To understand the mechanisms of broad neutralization, we implemented cryoEM to interrogate the structures of 11 psNbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S2</xref>). Additionally, two atomic psNb: RBD structures were determined by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S3</xref>). Epitope clustering based on high-resolution structures revealed five primary and distinct epitope classes in RBD<sub>SARS-CoV-2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). None of our psNbs (except for 2-57) overlap with key RBD mutations in variants including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Lambda, Gamma, and Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), in contrast to most other Nbs that have been structurally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8</xref>). Over three-quarters of the solvent-exposed and highly conserved RBD residues (sequence identity &gt; 85%) are covered by psNbs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Superposition onto the spike structure reveals that psNbs preferentially lock RBDs in the 3-up conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Despite having different epitopes and orientations, the small size of Nbs facilitates simultaneous binding of three copies to the spike trimer in distinct and highly symmetric configurations.</p>
<p id="P10">The <bold>Class II</bold> psNbs are overrepresented in our collection. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that while psNbs are diverse, those isolated from the booster converge more than the initial bleed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Two subclasses within the class II (A and B) differ in epitopes and Nb binding orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B and D</xref>). Nevertheless, II(A) and II(B) psNbs share a conserved hydrophobic core epitope (aa 377-386) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) containing two bulky hydrophobic residues (F377 and Y380), and this region is stabilized by a disulfide bond (C379-C432). The improved breadth in class II(B) psNbs, especially for clade 3 RBD<sub>BM-4831-CoV</sub> lies in its ability to target an additional conserved region with peripheral charged residues (aa 412-415, 427-429). In contrast, subclass II(A) psNbs bind to a less conserved epitope that is composed of primarily hydrophobic residues (e.g., L368, A372, and Y508) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Notably, A372 on SARS-CoV-2 (clade 1a) is substituted to S/T in other clades, forming a consensus glycosylation motif (<sup>370</sup>NST/S<sup>372</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), which may explain the reduced neutralization potency of class II (A) psNbs versus class (B) psNbs against SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">
<bold>Class II(B)</bold> psNbs comprise two large clusters possessing the best breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). While the epitopes largely overlap in the complex structure, the molecular interactions vary substantially. For example, two related psNbs (2-38 and 1-21) are characterized by a short CDR3 (13 aa) forming a β-strand hairpin conformation. Yet, psNb 2-38 is an all-clade binder whereas 1-21 binds strongly to all but RBD<sub>BM-4831-CoV</sub> (clade 3). The difference in binding is likely due to the K378Q substitution in the RBD, which disrupts a critical salt bridge between D110 (1-21) and K378 (RBD<sub>SARS-CoV-2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). psNbs 2-34 and 2-31 (from the other dominant cluster) bind all 24 RBDs strongly with potent antiviral activities. The interactions are predominantly mediated by a long CDR3 loop (18 aa) with a small helix. These Nbs form hydrophobic interactions and also bind strongly to conserved charged residues (such as D427 and R408) through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">
<bold>Class II(A)</bold> psNb (2-57) shares high sequence similarity with Nb105 (isolated from the initial bleed). The major difference lies in their CDR3 heads. Here, a small CDR3 loop of <sup>109</sup>DLF<sup>111</sup> in Nb105 is substituted by <sup>109</sup>QST<sup>111</sup> in 2-57, which inserts into two conserved pockets (RBD residues F377,Y369,F374 and residues S375,T376,Y508,V407) forming extensive hydrophobic interactions with the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12E</xref>). This substitution allows psNb 2-57 to tolerate sequence variation better, exhibiting over 100 fold higher affinities for clade 2 RBDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">
<bold>Class I</bold> psNbs that bind the RBS are extremely potent yet rare (~3%). The structure of the ultrapotent 2-67 was resolved by cryoEM in complex with the RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S13</xref>). Superposition of 2-67:RBD and hACE2:RBD (PDB 6M0J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) structures revealed major clashes between all three Nb framework regions and two CDRs (2 and 3) with hACE2 (aa 26-37, 66-87, 91-109, 187-194) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). 2-67 targets the protruding RBD ridge (aa 472-490) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15A</xref>). Binding energy analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>) reveals that compared to other RBS Nbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), the RBD binding epitope of 2-67 is minimally contributed by critical VOC residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S5</xref>). Here, 2-67 utilizes all CDRs to form extensive networks of hydrophobic and nonpolar interactions with two critical RBD residues that are not present as VOC mutations (F486 and Y489), and therefore, can achieve ultrahigh affinity for SARS-CoV-2 and retain strong binding and neutralization against the variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Moreover, 2-67 can outcompete ultrahigh-affinity Nb21 for RBS binding, thereby further corroborating the ultra-high affinity of this interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S14A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Interestingly, quantitative mass spectrometric analysis reveals that ultrapotent RBS binders (e.g., Nbs 20 and 21) identified from the initial bleed were absent in the booster, implying that they are sourced from short-lived plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S14B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">
<bold>Class III</bold> psNb (2-10) can destabilize the spike <italic>in vitro</italic> as we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, the structure can be resolved by reconstituting an RBD: 4 Nbs complex by cryoEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S13</xref>). 2-10 targets a rare non-RBS epitope that partially overlaps with that of Nb17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) isolated from the initial bleed that is partially effective against variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Class III psNb binds strongly to RBD variants and clade 1b and shows selectivity within other clades. Compared to Nb17 with limited breadth, the improved breadth of class III psNb is contributed by a recognition motif that shifts (from aa 356-357 to aa 449-450,481-484 and 490-494) towards a smaller and more conserved epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Four <bold>Class IV</bold> psNbs (1-22, 1-23, 2-65 and 2-45) were resolved by cryoEM. Their binding involves a plethora of molecular contacts that are dependent upon distinct scaffold orientations, different CDR combinations and sequence-specific bonding networks. Class IV shares a highly conserved and cryptic epitope that is only accessible in the RBD-up conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). The epitope is characterized by charged and hydrophobic residues (D427/D428, T430, F464, 516ELLH519) forming a cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). CDR3s of class IV adopt a “hairpin” conformation that inserts into the RBD cavity forming extensive hydrophobic and polar interactions. 1-22 and 1-23 are all-clade binders that recognize multiple other conserved RBD residues (L390, P426 and P463 for 1-22 and Y369 for 1-23) through hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>). 2-65 shows selectivity towards clade 1b and clade 3 likely due to a unique salt bridge between D124 (CDR3) and the semi-conserved H519 on RBDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15E</xref>). Notably, the class IV epitope partially overlaps with a newly discovered broadly neutralizing antibody S2H97(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and targets RBD from a distinct angle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S16</xref>). Compared to S2H97 which depends on bulky aromatic side chains (W, F, and Y) for interaction, the binding of 1-22 is primarily mediated through a combination of hydrophobic, non-aromatic (L, I, and V), and basic (R and H) residues. Facilitated by a unique orientation, <bold>Class V</bold> psNb (2-62, which shares high CDR similarity with 2-63) targets RBD through a conserved epitope (T333,L387,<sub>389</sub>DLC<sub>391</sub>, C525, L517, and P521) completely buried in the spike and a region that marginally overlaps with the binding motif of class IV psNbs (i.e., L517 and H519) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>). While 2-62 binds tightly to the RBD, it does not bind the pre-fusion spike and is therefore a poor neutralizer of the virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanisms of broad neutralization by psNbs</title>
<p id="P16">Our comprehensive investigation provides direct evidence that with successive immunization, antibodies emerged in the serum that concurrently and almost exhaustively target diverse and conserved physicochemical and geometric sites on the RBD. We observed that ultrahigh-affinity Nbs (i.e., sub-nM) exhibit neutralization potencies that correlate inversely, almost perfectly, with distance of their epitopes from the RBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Ultrapotent class I psNbs neutralize the virus at single-digit ng/ml by binding to the RBS to block hACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S17</xref>). Class II psNbs can still efficiently neutralize the virus (i.e., single-digit ng/ml) primarily by sterically interfering with the receptor binding. In particular, binding to the RBD can clash with the glycan moiety at N322 of hACE2, especially bulky complex-type glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S17</xref>). Class III, IV and V possess substantially weaker potencies. Their epitopes are distant from RBS and do not compete with hACE2 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p id="P17">To better understand the broad activities of psNbs, we also expressed a set of high-affinity RBD Nbs that have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and evaluated cross-reactivity by ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Nbs fall into two groups based on RBS occupancy. Overall, their cross-reactivities positively correlate with epitope sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). psNbs that do not bind the RBS can be separated based on high epitope conservation (&gt;0.85) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Critical mutations from the variants are predominantly located on the RBS but also recently on a small patch of relatively conserved residues (e.g., aa 371, 373 and 375) in Omicron (B.1.1.529). Additionally, the virus can mutate on A372S/T to acquire an N-linked glycan (N370) similar to other sarbecoviruses to blunt the host antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). While most Nbs and human IgGs directly interact with these residues, psNbs are barely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5</xref>). Mutations on these highly conserved epitopes can cause RBD instability reducing viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Compared to RBS Nbs that bind to concave epitopes, psNbs generally target smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>) and flat (class II,III and V) or convex (class I and IV) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). psNb epitopes are also more flexible based on average root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) for epitope residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Together, these properties may render high-affinity binding particularly challenging. Consistently, ScanNet, a geometric deep-learning model reveals that RBS epitopes are predominantly targeted by Nbs (and IgG antibodies) while the psNb epitopes are hardly recognized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S19</xref>). Moreover, compared to non-psNbs, psNbs utilize almost exclusively hypervariable CDR loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S18</xref>). Conceivably, extensive affinity maturation is required to bind these conserved yet difficult-to-bind epitopes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, producing variants with high transmissibility and potential to evade host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). New evidence indicates that infection or vaccination by boosting can improve the host antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Here we discovered that successive immunization of a camelid by recombinant RBD can enhance the development of super-immunity. Integrative proteomics facilitated rapid identification of a large repertoire of high-affinity V<sup>H</sup>H antibodies (Nbs) from the immunized sera against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and the full spectrum of sarbecovirus family. CryoEM and X-ray crystallography were able to systematically map broadly neutralizing epitopes and interactions, providing insights into the structural basis and evolution of serologic activities. Our data support the notion that RBD structure alone can drive this impressive level of evolution, reshaping the immunogenic landscape towards conserved epitopes. The initial immune response predominantly targets the RBS due to its favorable properties for protein-protein interactions (both host receptor and antibody binding). High-affinity antibodies can evolve to saturate this critical region with extremely high neutralization potency. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies will emerge (with unprecedented diversity) and can continuously develop improved affinity to target conserved epitopes, which provide resistance to antigenic drift. Their neutralization potencies vary substantially yet are strongly and negatively correlated with the distance of epitopes to the RBS-center for viral entry and effective host immunity. Together, our findings inform on the development of safe and broadly protective countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p id="P20">Preference for non-conserved epitopes is also observed in other viral antigen structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S20</xref>). We suggest that evolutionary conservation imposes constraints on spatio-chemical surface properties, which in turn constraints the immunogenicity of and access to epitopes, as hinted by an overall negative correlation between conservation and predicted epitope propensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S21</xref>). However, antibody repertoires are dynamic and can evolve towards conserved epitopes. In addition to COVID-19 super-immunity, potent broadly neutralizing antibodies have also been isolated from HIV elite controllers, although they usually take years to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">Our highly selected psNbs can bind strongly and specifically to all sarbecoviruses for potent neutralization with the best median antiviral potencies at single-digit ng/ml, which is extremely rare for cross-reactive antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Multivalent constructs (such as PiN-31) that target distinct and conserved epitopes and their cocktails may provide comprehensive coverage against future SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift and new sarbecovirus challenges. The low production costs and marked stability of Nbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (and other miniproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) allow for more equitable and efficient distributions globally, particularly for developing countries and regions that are vulnerable to viral spillovers. Combined with their small size (high effective dose and bioavailability) and flexible administration routes that protect both upper and lower respiratory tracts to limit airborne transmissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), ultrapotent and inhalable psNbs are therefore highly complementary to vaccines, small molecule drugs, and monoclonal antibody therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The prospects of winning the race against future outbreaks will rely on the fast development and equitable distribution of an arsenal of broadly protective, cost-effective and convenient technologies.</p>
