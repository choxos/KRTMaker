<abstract>
<p id="P1">The SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus has caused a worldwide pandemic because of the virus’s ability to transmit efficiently human-to-human. A key determinant of infection is the attachment of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because of the presumed zoonotic origin of SC2, there is no practical way to assess every species susceptibility to SC2 by direct challenge studies. In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SC2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SC2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SC2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from <italic>Felis</italic> (cat), <italic>Equus</italic> (horse), <italic>Sus</italic> (pig), <italic>Capra</italic> (goat), <italic>Mesocricetus</italic> (Golden hamster), <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic> (Little Brown bat) and <italic>Hipposideros armiger</italic> (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SC2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SC2 and emerging variant viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2 (SC2)] which was first reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019. This virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats, and transmission of the virus to humans has likely occurred through an intermediate animal host which has not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses, several of which cause respiratory diseases in humans, from the common cold to more rare and serious diseases such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both of which have high case fatality rates and were detected for the first time in 2002 and 2012, respectively.</p>
<p id="P3">CoVs are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> within the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, Order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. The viruses are divided into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-CoV based on phylogenetic and genomic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). All CoVs currently known to cause disease in humans belong to the alpha- or beta-CoV groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In addition, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV and gamma-CoV induce significant disease on various domestic animal species, including porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine enteric diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in poultry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Based on sequence analysis, human coronaviruses have animal origins. The SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are thought to have originated in bats, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 appear to have come from rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The 2002 SARS-CoV-1 recombined in civet cats and humans whereas the 2012 MERS-CoV appeared to have spread from bats to dromedary camels and then to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">The main surface protein of CoVs is the spike (S) protein that facilitates receptor binding and fusion of the viral lipid envelope with the host cell membrane. Receptor binding is facilitated by the S1 subunit while the S2 subunit is involved with fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). For these two events to occur, the S protein needs to be post-transitionally modified by two different host proteases to become activated. For SC2, furin-like proteases cleave the S protein at the S1/S2 site that contains a multiple basic amino acid motif (RRAR) that is different from SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The S protein undergoes additional cleavage at the S2’ site by the cellular type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, other proteases have been described to activate CoVs including cathepsin L, TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">SARS-CoV and SC2 utilize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for attachment on host cells with the S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). ACE-2 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues. ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7, which are involved with vasodilation effects in the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Due to conservations of the ACE2 gene among animal species, the potential host range of SC2 is thought to be extensive.</p>
<p id="P6">The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes have homologues in many animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Several species, including house cats, ferrets, and golden hamsters, have been shown to be naturally and/or experimentally infected with SC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). These three species have &gt;80% sequence similarity in their ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes when compared to the human genes. The chicken, which does not appear to be a susceptible host, has an ACE2 homology of less than 70% to the human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However other species like pigs have a sequence similarity of &gt;80%, but are poorly susceptible to infection. Based on previous work with SARS-CoV, the binding of S1 to ACE2 can be defined by the interaction of relatively few amino acids, and predictions of host susceptibility based on these interactions have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Despite the clear importance of the binding of the spike protein to ACE2, the prediction of host susceptibility does involve other factors including the level and tissue distribution of ACE2 expression and the requirement for protease activation.</p>
<p id="P7">Because chickens are not susceptible to SC2 virus, and their ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protease are distinctly different from the human equivalents, we developed an avian cell line to screen the potential host range of infection of the virus through the expression the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and animal species to provide novel insights into the receptor usage, replication and potential host range of SC2 These studies were designed to determine if the host restriction is strictly from the difference in the receptor and/or protease. One long-term goal of this work is to develop a predictive framework for improved epidemic surveillance to include protection of agriculturally relevant species and animal species that are hard to test experimentally.</p>

<title>Viruses</title>
<p id="P8">The USA-WA1/2020 (BEI NR-58221, original material was provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) was obtained from BEI Research Resources Repository, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The virus was propagated and titrated in ATCC-CCL-81 Vero cells and was utilized at 6 or 7 total passages in Vero cells. Experiments with SC2 were performed in a biosafety level-3 enhanced facility with procedures approved by the U.S. National Poultry Research Center Institutional Biosafety Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Cell lines</title>
<p id="P9">DF1 (avian fibroblast), Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and Vero (African Green monkey kidney, CCL-81) cells were seeded and propagated with standard procedures for adherent cells in flasks containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) and 1% Antimicrobial-Antimycotic (GeminiBio, Sacramento, CA). At each passage adherent cells were disassociated with trypsin (GIBCO) when at 95-100% confluence and passaged. Cells were incubated (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Vero cells were obtained from the International Reagent Resource (FR-243). MDCK cells were obtained from ATCC and were included because this sub-lineage was not able to support SC2 replication, therefore could serve as an additional cell line to evaluate results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Construction of transgenic cell lines using lentivirus vectors expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P10">DF1 and MDCK cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 X 10<sup>5</sup> in 500μl DMEM containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Antimicrobial-Antimycotic (Sigma), in one well each of a 12 well plate, and left overnight as above. Once cells reached 50-75% confluence, the media was removed and lentivirus particles were added, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The lentivirus contained the human ACE2 gene under control of the CMV promoter along with green fluorescent protein (GFP) also under control of a separate CMV promoter (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD). A MOI of 20 was used for lentivirus transduction. For TMPRSS2 transduction, lentivirus particles containing the human TMPRSS2 gene under control of the CMV promoter and red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene under control of a separate CMV promoter (Gentarget, San Diego, CA), were added to achieve a MOI of 20. Polybrene (8μg/ml) was added to each transduction reaction, supplied from the manufacturers, to aid with membrane charge. Cells were incubated at 39°C for 72 hours after which media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing 10% FBS. Transduction was confirmed using an EVOS 5000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), equipped with GFP, RFP, DAPI and transmitted light cubes, to visualize cells expressing GFP or RFP, or both. Production of DF1 or MDCK cells expressing only human ACE2 (defined as +-) or only human TMPRSS2 (defined -+), or both (defined as ++), was confirmed by RT-PCR and purification by FACS cell sorting for either green or red fluorescence. For construction of cells expressing both, the human ACE2 was first inserted and purified for GFP (99% GFP-positive) followed by human TMPRSS2 insertion and cell sorting for both RFP- and GFP-positive cells (See Supplemental figure 1). Confirmation of human ACE2 and human TMPRSS2 expression was performed by RT-PCR and western blot.</p>

The plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to allow virus to adsorb to the cells. Each well was washed 3-times with sterile PBS prewarmed at 37°C to remove unbound virus. Finally, 3 ml growth medium was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Supernatant (0.2mL) was collected from each well individually at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours post inoculation (hpi) for detection of replicating virus by RT-PCR, and detection of cytopathic effect. After 72 hpi, plates were frozen and thawed at −80C (3x total) and 400 ul of cell culture supernatant was transferred onto fresh cell cultures as above for a pass 2.</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P24">Quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to detect and determine virus titers in cell culture supernatants. RNA was extracted with the Ambion Magmax kit (ThermoFisher). The US Centers for Disease Control N1 primers and probe for SARS-CoV-2 were used with the AgPath ID one-step RT-PCR kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The cycling conditions for the RT step were modified to accommodate the recommended kit conditions. A standard curve of RNA from titrated SARS-CoV-2 virus stock was run in duplicate to establish titer equivalents of virus.</p>

<title>Development of DF1 and MDCK cell lines expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P27">These studies were designed to transgenically introduce the human receptor and protease used by SC2 into the avian non-permissive cell line, DF1, and MDCK, to test requirements for replication competence and establish a model for infection potential. A lentivirus approach was used to deliver the human ACE2 and human TMPRSS2 genes, under control of the CMV promoter. The lentivirus constructs co-expressed GFP (ACE2) and/or RFP (TMPRSS2) to allow FACS sorting for purification of cells containing each target gene or both genes (Supplemental Figure 1A, B, C). Positive DF1 and MDCK cells were demonstrated expressing either the human ACE2 gene or human TMPRSS2 gene alone, or both, based on microscopy and two-color cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplemental Figure 2). Detection of the inserted genes was confirmed with RT-PCR using primers specific for the human and chicken genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Expression of human ACE2 and human TMPRSS2 protein in DF1 ++ and MDCK ++ cells was confirmed via western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics in DF1 and MDCK cell lines expressing human ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P28">Growth curves for all three cell lines (Vero, DF1, and MDCK) expressing only human ACE2 (+-), only human TMPRSS2 (-+), or both (++) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. No increase in virus titer was demonstrated in wild type DF1 or MDCK, or the DF1 and MDCK cells expressing singe gene constructs with human ACE2 or human TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, virus replication was observed in Vero (positive control), and the DF1++ and MDCK ++ cells. Virus growth was exponential until approximately 36 hours post infection and was statistically higher in these cells than others tested. Virus titers reached similar levels of approximately 10<sup>5.6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> in these three cell lines, and demonstrated a requirement for expression of both the receptor and the protease. We next passaged the 72 hour sample from each cell line after a freeze thaw cycle onto a subsequent plate of the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). No evidence of increased replication was seen in cell lines that did not demonstrate signs of virus replication during the first passage. In contrast, the Vero, DF1++, and MDCK ++ passage 1 samples contained enough virus to induce infection and replication on passage 2, although the growth curves displayed a more linear increase in virus titer over time compared to passage 1 inoculated cells.</p>

<title>Comparison of cytopathic effects and detection of virus in cell lines expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P29">The appearance of CPE and confirmation of virus protein inside of the cell lines was performed via light microscopy and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the SC2 spike and nucleoprotein. Neither CPE nor virus could be detected in cells without virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) or in the DF1 and MDCK inoculated cells. Likewise, cell lines containing the singular insertion of either the human ACE2 or TMPRSS2 did not exhibit CPE or positive viral staining (data not shown). Vero, DF1++, and MDCK++ demonstrated syncytia formation with loss of cell confluence. The monolayer also deteriorated by 72 hpi and CPE correlated with detection of high levels of expression of the viral spike and nucleoprotein by immunostaining at 48 hpi.</p>

<sec id="S21">
<title>Development of cell lines expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 from different animal species</title>
<p id="P30">Having demonstrated a model of virus replication in the non-permissive avian DF1 cell line with insertion of the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, we next developed cells lines expressing other species ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to screen for potential animal hosts that could support replication. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from house cat, goat, golden hamster, horse, pig, Little Brown bat, and Great Roundleaf bat were <italic>de novo</italic> constructed in the PiggyBac transposon system and transfected into DF1 cells. Purification of cells with green/red fluorescence was used as with the lentivirus system. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, RT-PCR confirmed expression of animal ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in DF1 cells from FACS-sorted cells.</p>

<sec id="S22">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells expressing animal ACE2 or TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P31">The replication kinetics of SC2 virus in DF1 cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from the different animal species was determined. Results demonstrate that the SC2 virus could replicate to high levels in DF1 cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from cat, goat and golden hamster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Virus titers reached similar levels of approximately 10<sup>5.1</sup> to 10<sup>5.8</sup> TCID50 at 36 hours post infection in these lines, which was similar to that observed in the Vero control cells. No virus replication was observed in the cells expressing the receptor and protease from pig or horse species. Both bat species demonstrated initial gains in virus titers, between 10<sup>3.3</sup> and 10<sup>3.9</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> at 12 hours post infection that did not increase after this time. The 72 hpi sample from all cell lines were passaged onto a subsequent plate of cells. Passage 2 results indicate viral infection and replication from plates containing the cat, goat and golden hamster animal cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). As observed previously, a linear shaped curve in virus replication was observed in passage 2. Neither the pig nor the horse cell lines had evidence of virus replication in passage 2. The samples from the two bat species cell lines also had no evidence of replication on passage 2.</p>
<p id="P32">Sequence analysis of available TMPRSS2 sequence data for human and animal species demonstrated a truncation at the 5’ end of the bat protein compared to human or other animals (Supplemental Figure 3). The human protein has 492 amino acids (AA), whereas the Little Brown bat contains 243 AA and Great Roundleaf bat has 384 AA. It is not clear if the bat sequences available in GenBank were incorrectly annotated and are not representative of the complete protein, and that the bat species TMPRSS2 tested here may not be functional due to the missing the N-terminal portion of the protein. The Little Brown bat open reading frame begins at human amino acid position 255, and the Great Roundleaf bat begins at human position 113. Interestingly, Brandts bat (<italic>Myotis brandtii</italic>) contained a protease similar to human and other animals.</p>

<title>Comparison of cytopathic effects and detection of virus in cell lines expressing animal ACE2 and TMPRSS2</title>
<p id="P33">As before, detection of virus was observed via CPE and immunostaining of transgenic cell lines. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, we detected cytopathic effects in cell lines that supported growth of the virus, including the ones expressing the cat, goat and golden hamster genes. We also observed CPE in both the cell lines expressing the bat genes which appeared more rapidly in the Great Roundleaf bat cell line compared to the Little Brown bat cell line. Staining for viral proteins was greatest in cells expressing cat, goat or golden hamster transgenes. Interestingly, we did observe positive staining in the bat species cells, however, it was visibly reduced compared to the other positive cell lines. We did not observe either CPE or viral staining in the cell lines expressing pig and horse genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P34">Several cell lines and organoids are currently in use or have been developed to study SC2 replication. Besides Vero cells, Caco-2, Calu-2, and Hek293T cells, human lung, kidney, liver and blood vessel organoids have been demonstrated to be permissive for virus growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). However, because these systems can naturally be infected, they are not useful for testing host susceptibility to the virus. Previous research done in our laboratory and by others clearly demonstrate that poultry and other bird species cannot support replication of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). We hypothesized that avian cell lines could become permissible to infection if they expressed a suitable ACE2 receptor and produced high enough levels of a protease that could activate SC-2. It is worth mentioning that proteolytic cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 interface was assumed to be provided by furin-like enzymes naturally present in the DF1 or MDCK cell lines.</p>
<p id="P35">The SC2 utilizes the ACE2 protein as the primary receptor for entry into host cells and the TMPRSS2 protease has been shown to be critical for cleavage/activation of the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In these studies, the transgenic insertion of the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes conferred virus attachment and replication ability in the non-permissive avian DF1 cell lines and MDCK cell lines. The results also demonstrated that single expression of either the human receptor or the protease was not sufficient to allow for virus replication in these cell lines, either through a lack of attachment or spike protein activation. These studies also demonstrate DF1 cells expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from different animal species can be used as an <italic>in vitro</italic> predictive model for virus replication. Wild type DF1 cells are normally incapable of supporting SC2 replication; however, expression of the receptor and protease genes from human, cat, goat and golden hamster allowed virus replication. This <italic>in vitro</italic> model correlates with the known natural or experimental susceptibility of three of these species and supports its use as a predictive model. The surprising result is the potential susceptibility of goats. Goats have not been known to be naturally or experimentally infected at this time, but one study has previously suggested that SC2 can infect HEK cells that are expressing goat ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p>
<p id="P36">Multiple studies have looked at experimental inoculation in pigs, swine cell lines, and in cell lines where the swine ACE2 gene has been expressed with mixed results. Three different experimental challenge studies with swine were conducted with 2 studies showing no infection and a third showing only a small number of pigs infected after challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Two swine cell lines, swine testicular and porcine kidney cells, were also found to develop CPE after several passages of virus. Multiple studies have also used different mammalian cell lines and transfected them with the swine ACE2 gene to allow for transient expression of the gene, and most found that SC2 or a SC2 pseudovirus could attach to and express protein in the cell as measured by several different methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). This predictive data based on ACE2 data from some species, such as swine, suggest susceptibility to infection, although our results in DF1 cells did not show evidence of virus replication. One possible explanation for the discrepancy in animal studies and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies is that the ACE2 protein in swine is not efficiently expressed in the respiratory tract, which is the most likely route of exposure, and the virus cannot efficiently attach and infect the exposed pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Although results in swine are discordant, our studies using an avian cell line correlates closer with the swine challenge studies as we did not measure any virus in the cell supernatant that would be evidence of the virus completing the replication cycle, despite the possibility that the virus could attach to the modified cell line based on these previous studies.</p>
<p id="P37">The results with the horse ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes showed no evidence of infection despite the relatively high sequence conservation of the horse ACE2 protein to human ACE2 at over 86%, which is higher than cats and Golden hamsters. Although the sequence similarity of human and horse ACE2 is high, the difficulty in challenging horses in a Biosafety level 3 animal facility has likely prevented the research from being performed. Our results provide additional support that horses are not susceptible to infection and do not need to be experimentally challenged.</p>
<p id="P38">Bats have been identified as likely reservoirs of both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to humans through intermediate hosts including civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The SC2 virus appears capable to bind to Little Brown bat and Great Roundleaf Bat ACE2 as observed by positive immunostaining and transient virus replication. However, the TMPRSS2 protease found in these species may not be functional as it lacks the 5’ terminus found in human and other animals, including other bat species. Analysis of the GenBank record suggests that only partial sequence is available and that the gene was not properly annotated and thus the gene sequences used in these studies may not represent the true open reading frame. Further research is required to determine whether the anomaly is a sequence artifact. However, at least one report predicts low level fusion from Little Brown bat ACE2 compared to human ACE2, similar to the results described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Further research is also underway to determine the contribution of different bat species ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as a barrier to SC2 infection.</p>
<p id="P39">As noted, SC2 appears to have a broad host range among mammals, however the full host range is unknown. Predictive <italic>in silico</italic> studies based on ACE2 analysis have described potential broad host tropism of the virus to numerous species including cat, goat and hamster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). These studies also predict many aquatic species including whales and dolphins to have high likelihood of binding to SC2 spike protein. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the TMPRSS2 protein is less predictive, but the protease activation of the SC2 spike protein is necessary for replication to occur. As noted earlier, proteases other than TMPRSS2 have been demonstrated to have the ability to cleave the spike protein. <italic>In vivo</italic> testing of many large domestic animals and wild animal species would be difficult, if not impossible, because of the requirement for work in a secure biocontainment facility. Therefore we propose this model could be utilized to screen many species for susceptibility to SC2 infection. Understanding the host range of SC2 is crucial to understanding the ecology of the virus and the role different species may play as reservoirs or bridge-species into humans. Species that can be infected also may be affected by disease. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> testing in DF1 ++ cells positively correlated with available <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge data. Taken together, the integration and expression of the ACE2 and TMPRRS2 from a target species in the otherwise non-permissive avian cell line provides a rapid and economical method to screen species for susceptibility to SC2.</p>

<title>Importance</title>
</caption>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) is believed to have originated in animal species and jumped into humans where it has produced the greatest viral pandemic of our time. Identification of animal species susceptible to SC2 infection would provide information on potential zoonotic reservoirs, and transmission potential at the human-animal interface. Our work provides a model system to test the ability of the virus to replicate in an otherwise non-permissive cell line by transgenic insertion of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and other animal species. The results from our in vitro model positively correlate with animal infection studies enhancing the predicative capability of the model. Importantly, we demonstrate that both proteins are required for successful virus replication. These findings establish a framework to test other animal species for susceptibility to infection that may be critical zoonotic reservoirs for transmission, as well as to test variant viruses that arise over time.</p>

<title>DF1 and MDCK cells expressing the human ACE2 (with GFP marker) and TMPRSS2 (with RFP marker) genes.</title>
<p>DF1 and MDCK cells were transduced with lentivirus containing the human ACE2 gene and cells were FACS purified based on GFP expression. Lentivirus containing the humanTMPRSS2 gene was then transduced into the human-ACE2 expressing DF1 and MDCK cells. Following two-color FACS for GFP and RFP expressing cells, dual positive cells were grown for 48 hours in an 8-chamber glass slide. Fluorescence was captured on an EVOS M5000 with added DAPI nuclear stain (blue) GFP and RFP.</p>
