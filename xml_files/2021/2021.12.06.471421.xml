To understand the mechanisms underlying these cellular changes, we performed high-dimensional immune cell profiling of PBMCs from COVID-19-infected patients, in combination with single cell transcriptomic analysis of COVID-19 BALFs. Hypoxia, a hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS, was found to elicit a global metabolic reprogramming in effector lymphocytes. In response to oxygen and nutrient-deprived microenvironments, these cells shift from aerobic respiration to increase their dependence on anaerobic processes including glycolysis, mitophagy, and glutaminolysis to fulfill their bioenergetic demands. We also demonstrate metabolic dysregulation of ciliated lung epithelial cells is linked to significant increase of proinflammatory cytokine secretion and upregulation of HLA class 1 machinery. Augmented HLA class-1 antigen stimulation by epithelial cells leads to cellular exhaustion of metabolically dysregulated CD8 and NK cells, impairing their memory cell differentiation. Unsupervised clustering techniques revealed multiple distinct, differentially abundant CD8 and NK memory cell states that are marked by high glycolytic flux, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular exhaustion, further highlighting the connection between disrupted metabolism and impaired memory cell function in COVID-19. Our findings provide novel insight on how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects host immunometabolism and anti-viral response during COVID-19.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2">

Increased glycolytic dependence of CD8 T cells from COVID-19 patients was suggested by the upregulation of 2-(2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-deoxyglucose) (2-NBDG) uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) has been well known to govern glycolytic flux <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and participates in the generation of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes (CTLs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The frequency and expression of GLUT1 in CTLs present in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4C, D</xref>), suggesting that these cells are phenotypically glycolytic.

Understanding the role of cellular metabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis has key implications in both COVID-19 prognosis and treatment. Here, we used single-cell omics techniques to construct a comprehensive metabolic landscape of immune cells involved in the SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral response. Evaluating cells from both the BALF and the blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed that lymphocyte populations undergo a global metabolic reprogramming towards anaerobic processes, resulting in compromised memory cell differentiation and effector function.

Although an increased abundance of exhausted PD1<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in severe patients was found, this was not accompanied by any difference in extracellular acidification (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OXPHOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Additionally, using flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing, the Powell group discovered a novel population of VDAC1<sup>+</sup> exhausted T cells in PBMCs from severe COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, they did not detect any significant change in the expression of glycolysis-regulating genes in T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, which is contradictory to our results. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that the aforementioned study stimulated isolated PBMCs with αCD3/CD28 polyclonal activation or with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptide libraries. Prolonged maintenance and stimulation of T cells under normoxic conditions is not reflective of the hypoxic microenvironment conditions present during severe COVID-19 infection, which may result in the attenuation or nulling of any potential metabolic differences present in COVID-19. Another potential explanation arises from the fact that cellular metabolism in these studies was assessed for entire T cell populations. Given that T cells are highly heterogeneous with respect to their metabolism, metabolic profiles need to be assessed on specific T cell subpopulations instead of bulk T cells. In contrast, by using high-dimensional flow cytometry to investigate the single-cell metabolism of unstimulated PBMCs immediately after isolation, and assessing single cell transcriptomic data from the BALF, we aimed to capture the metabolic state of the cells from their original microenvironment. Our single-cell omics approach allowed us to detect distinct differences in metabolic phenotypes of specific, highly resolved lymphocyte populations. We found that in response hypoxic conditions, there is a metabolic reprogramming of CD8 and NK cell subsets traditionally reliant on OXPHOS and FAO toward anaerobic glucose metabolism, which along with mitochondrial dysfunction, triggers cellular exhaustion and disrupts memory differentiation, resulting in a compromised anti-viral response.</p><p id="P43">In this study, we uncover a clear link between cellular metabolism, severe COVID-19, and disrupted memory cell development. During infection, hypoxia resulting from lung epithelial cell damage triggers a global metabolic reprogramming of CD8 and NK cell subsets from OXPHOS and FAO towards anaerobic glucose metabolism. Upon activation, CD8 cells typically exhibit a Warburg like metabolic adaptation to rely on aerobic glycolysis; thus, a metabolic switch from aerobic to HIF-1a mediated anaerobic glycolysis will not impair initial T cell activation into effector subsets, which is consistent with reports demonstrating hyperactivation of CD8 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, because of prolonged anaerobic glycolysis, the lung microenvironment becomes increasingly hostile, resulting in nutrient depleted, hyperlactatemic, and hypoxic conditions. Herein, we show that this dysregulated metabolism is heavily tied with impaired memory lymphocyte formation. Although memory lymphocytes are traditionally associated with a heavy reliance on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation, we have detected multiple clusters of cellular state associated with high glucose uptake, ROS production, hypoxia mediated transcriptional response, and cellular exhaustion in CD8 and NK memory cell populations that were specifically enriched in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These populations were negatively associated with memory lymphocyte frequency, suggesting that this metabolic switch may halt the transition of activated lymphocytes into memory cells. Pseudotime analysis and trajectory interference with transcriptomic data further demonstrate differentiation of tissue-resident memory cells that was tied to altered lymphocyte metabolism. In addition to anaerobic glycolysis, upregulation of glutaminolysis and mitophagy was also seen in CD8 memory cells in order to sustain bioenergetic demands. Clustering solely on metabolic phenotype revealed clear distinctions between healthy, moderate, and severe patients in CD8 memory cells, suggesting the potential use of metabolic markers in predicting memory cell response.</p><p id="P44">Interestingly, we found that SARA-CoV-2 derived EC damage creates oxygen-deprived conditions in the lungs that not only induce metabolic reprogramming of various immune cell subsets, but also themselves. We found that during COVID-19 infection, differential metabolism drives lung ECs towards senescence and towards acquiring a significant SASP phenotype, leading to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced HLA class 2 mediated immunosurveillance, and increased HLA class 1 machinery. Chronic stimulation of exhausted lymphocytes, that demonstrate attenuated effector function and cytokine secretion in nutrient-depleted microenvironments, by antigen presenting cells via HLA class 1 leads to significantly increased cellular exhaustion, which further impairs the capacity of cells to differentiate into memory phenotypes. Our results therefore show that the immunometabolic rewiring of ECs in the BALF can be a potential mechanism for organ-specific lymphocyte exhaustion and memory cell dysfunction. Further, this observation thus highlights that unconventional antigen presentation on non-hematopoietic ECs via HLA class 1, in addition to conventional antigen presentation by professional APCs (monocyte, DC, and macrophage), can be considered as a potential target for therapeutic development.</p><p id="P45">Reports have shown that unconventional T cells such as NKTs are attenuated in COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are unknown. Herein, we provided evidence suggesting that ECs induce NKT exhaustion and dysfunction through prolonged antigen stimulation resulting from a hypoxia-mediated metabolic adaptation. The traditional view that NK cells are short-lived innate lymphocytes is being challenged by new data demonstrating that NK cells can develop long lasting, antigen-specific memory in response to viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Recently, CD62L<sup>high</sup> NK were identified as a subset possessing multiple characteristics of memory cells, demonstrating rapid responsiveness towards viral restimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In the current study, we discovered that metabolic disorders cause CD62L<sup>+</sup> NK lymphocytopenia via impairment of memory formation.

Ideally, we suggest that attempts to target T cell glycolysis in COVID-19 should take place after clonal expansion and formation of initial antigen specific T cells, but before initiation of memory cell formation. It is possible that the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment in COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> may be due to steroid-mediated inhibition of glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, dexamethasone administration may be able to rescue T cell dysfunction, improve memory cell formation, and reduce CRS via inhibition of glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. A recent stage-2 clinical trial reported that the use of 2-DG, a glucose analogue used to inhibit glycolytic flux, as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 was highly successful in improving patient outcomes, furthering glycolysis as a potential target to restore T cell fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. In support of the importance of time-dependent treatment for COVID-19, type 1 IFN, which was reported to induce the metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis into OXPHOS and FAO in immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, was only effective as a treatment option in COVID-19 when administrated early after infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, delayed type 1 IFN treatment resulted in worsening of COVID-19 severity due to the pro-inflammatory induction capacity of this cytokine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Further, our results implicate mitophagy as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In response to a nutrient-depleted and hypoxic microenvironment, effector CD8 T cells may upregulate mitophagy as an alternative survival mechanism. However, prolonged upregulation may induce lymphocyte exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Accordingly, ablating mitophagy in CTLs can potentially redirect T cells towards memory cell differentiation and rescue them from exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Furthermore, unlike glycolysis, mitophagy is not critical for T cell activation and effector cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, mitophagy-targeting approaches can potentially be used immediately after COVID-19 infection. Targeting mitophagy with a specific mitophagy inhibitor such as Mdivi-1 should be explored as a treatment regimen for COVID-19.</p><p id="P47">Supplemental oxygen as opposed to ventilation was shown to improve the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Our current study suggests that hypoxia is a key regulator of immunometabolic dysfunction during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, efforts to maintain blood oxygen saturation early in the course of infection are vital for patient recovery and improvement. Immunological outcomes post-initial infection such as memory cell formation dictate the severity of response upon re-exposure to the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In this regard, metabolism can also influence the immune response after recovery from SARS-CoV-2. Because both effector function and memory differentiation are severely impaired in lymphocytes, T cell immunity may be compromised even in recovered patients. Given the cumulatively rising COVID-19 reinfection rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, future studies investigating how metabolism affects the humoral response, including activation, antibody secretion, and long-term plasma cell differentiation of memory B, are imperative. We could not detect any population of T follicular helper cells in the BALF from 13 severe patients, suggesting that metabolic dysregulations also impaired germinal center formation in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. In support of our current observation, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation are known to suppress the generation of germinal center B cells and follicular helper cells after viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

Additionally, our assessment of cellular metabolism is limited to analysis surface and intracellular metabolic marker expression, coupled with transcriptomic data for key metabolic pathways. Future studies should aim to validate our results using approaches that shed more light into functional metabolism such as Seahorse Metabolic Flux profiling or metabolomics.
