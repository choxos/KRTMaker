<abstract>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health concern, and new treatment strategies are needed <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4), and its mouse homologue, caspase-11 (CASP11), are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and that <italic>CASP4</italic> expression correlates with severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2-infected <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) and gasdermin-D knock out (<italic>Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice. GSDMD is a downstream effector of CASP11 and CASP1. Notably, viral titers were similar in the three genotypes. Global transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected WT, <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL6, and CXCL1, and neutrophil functions, were reduced in <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> lungs. Additionally, <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11, promotes detrimental SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.</p>

<p id="P3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infectious agent of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that can induce hyper-inflammatory responses, including cytokine storm, in the lungs as well as extra-pulmonary organs in severe cases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. IL-6, CXCL1, IL-1α, IL-1β and type I interferons, among other cytokines, are thought to contribute to pathological manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. In addition, formation of thrombi that can cause myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism is a hallmark of severe Covid-19. Endothelial and neutrophil dysfunctions during SARS-CoV-2 infection increase the incidence of thromboembolic complications<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Thrombus formation is initiated by von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein released by damaged endothelial cells and megakaryocytes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. VWF also self-associates, forming strings protruding into the lumen serving as a scaffold for platelet adhesion and aggregation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Cellular sensors of infection, such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), C-type lectin receptors, and the NLRP3 inflammasome have been implicated in triggering the induction and secretion of cytokines and inflammatory lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. However, the contribution of these pathogen-sensing pathways and other inflammasome components in mediating host defense versus immune-mediated pathology and thrombosis during SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. While effector molecules downstream of infection-sensing pathways, such as specific inflammatory cytokines, have been targeted in attempts to limit virus-induced tissue damage, most of these strategies failed to exert major benefits in human clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, strategies targeting molecules upstream of multiple inflammatory cytokines or chemokines may be more effective, though this remains to be experimentally tested. Here, we investigate the role of a major member of the non-canonical inflammasome, caspase-11 (CASP11), and its downstream effector Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity using knockout mouse models and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P4">Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that specifically cleave their substrates at the C-terminal side of aspartic acid residues. CASP11 is a murine protein that is critical for defense against bacterial pathogens. Human caspase-4 (CASP4) displays high homology to murine CASP11<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> and we have demonstrated that human CASP4 mediates many functions of mouse CASP11 in macrophages during bacterial infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. CASP4/11 is a component of the non-canonical inflammasome with multiple functions that remain to be fully characterized. One major role for this protein is the cleavage of GSDMD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Once cleaved, the GSDMD N-terminal fragment inserts into the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells to form pores that allow the release of IL-1β and other molecules, sometimes leading to cell lysis and death known as pyroptosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has posited potential roles for GSDMD downstream of caspases in mediating inflammatory pathology during SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 infection studies in GSDMD genetically deficient animal models have not yet been performed, though clinical trials testing inhibitors of GSDMD in COVID-19 patients were not promising<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Likewise, the role of CASP4/11 in viral infections has not been explored, despite the induction of these proteins by the antiviral type I and II interferons<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. This notable induction by interferons and the broad roles of CASP4/11 in regulating diverse inflammatory pathologies, including bacterial infections, gouty arthritis, and gastroenteritis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, prompted us to investigate its role in SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p>

<title>CASP4/11 expression is elevated in the lungs during SARS-CoV-2 infections of mice and humans and correlates with disease severity in humans</title>
<p id="P5">CASP4/11 is weakly expressed or absent in resting cells, but is induced in response to bacterial infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. The analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing data of nasopharyngeal swab material from subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and healthy donors (GEO accession: GSE163151), revealed that <italic>CASP4</italic> is highly expressed in the airway of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and that expression levels increase with disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Additionally, we found that human lung sections from COVID-19 patients show higher levels of CASP4 staining compared with healthy lung controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), owing to greater numbers of CASP4 positive cells in the infected lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We then performed intranasal infection of C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice with pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (strain MA10)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>, and found that infection strongly induces <italic>Casp11</italic> expression throughout murine lung tissue within 4 days of infection as detected by RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The level of CASP11 protein, likewise, went from below detection to highly-expressed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection of murine lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We further examined infection of K18-hACE2 mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor using human isolate SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 (WA1). Similar to mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2, the non-adapted human virus strongly induced the lung expression of CASP11 as demonstrated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Overall, CASP4 is highly expressed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, and CASP11 is similarly induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection of mice.</p>

<sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Gsdmd</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup>, and mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 MA10 for comparison of weight loss, a commonly used indicator of overall infection severity in mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. We found that WT mice lost a significant percentage of their body weight between days 1 and 4 post-infection, followed by partial recovery of weight up to day 7, at which point we ended our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice, on the other hand, lost weight only up to day 3, and then rapidly recovered fully to their original weight by day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In comparison, weight loss of <italic>Gsdmd</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice was not significantly different from that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These data indicate that CASP11 promotes disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that this function is not mediated by GSDMD.</p>
<p id="P7">To determine whether differences in disease severity could be explained by differences in viral replication, we quantified live virus titers in WT, <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Gsdmd</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lungs at 2 and 4 days post-infection. We found that viral loads were similar with no statistical difference between the mice genotypes at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We also observed that, in agreement with previous reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, viral titers were decreased at day 4 compared with day 2 in all groups, demonstrating that neither CASP11 nor GSDMD are required for viral clearance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To corroborate these findings, lung sections from WT and <italic>Casp11</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice were stained for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and similar staining patterns were observed with prominent infection of cells lining the airways and neighboring alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of CASP11, but not GSDMD, prevents severe disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection without affecting virus replication or clearance.</p>

Since sensing of virus replication by cells generally induces interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, we investigated whether CASP11 or GSDMD shape the antiviral gene program during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, we specifically examined the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are abundantly upregulated by type I IFN stimulation in murine airway epithelial cells<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">The medical and research communities have met challenges in identifying specific inflammatory mediators that can be targeted to ameliorate disease without impairing beneficial aspects of the immune response, such as viral clearance. A major impediment to mechanistic research in this regard has been the difficulty in infecting mouse models with SARS-CoV-2. Here we utilized the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (strain MA10)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> that was plaque purified, grown in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, and sequenced to ensure that it lacks the attenuating tissue culture adaptations present in stocks of the virus grown in standard Vero cells, the most commonly used cell line for SARS-CoV-2 propagation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Our extensive purification regimen allowed us to achieve measurable pathogenicity in C57BL/6 mice and to infect gene knockout (KO) animals for mechanistic research <italic>in vivo</italic>. This manuscript thus represents one of the first <italic>in vivo</italic> studies performed with SARS-CoV-2 in specific KO animals.</p>
<p id="P19">The active inflammasome complex has been implicated in many disease conditions and infections, including SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Cell culture experiments identified a minor role for the canonical inflammasome member caspase-1 (CASP1) in SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. On the other hand, CASP11, a member of the non-canonical inflammasome, has not been previously investigated in this context <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. CASP11 is not expressed by resting cells, yet it is induced by bacterial infection and several cytokines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. We mined available clinical data and found that the expression of human CASP4 in COVID-19 testing swab material correlates with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we found that the expression of CASP4 is elevated in lung sections of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Similarly, mouse CASP11 is upregulated in the lungs of WT mice in response to SARS-CoV-2. We previously reported that CASP11 restricts <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> infections by regulating actin dynamics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. CASP11 recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol leading to downstream activation of CASP1 and IL-1β<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. However, the role of CASP11 is not restricted to Gram-negative bacteria that produce LPS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, since we found that CASP11 is exploited by the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), to survive in macrophages<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. In these cases, CASP11 regulates the functions of actin machinery to affect vesicular trafficking and cell migration. While it is possible that reduced neutrophil infiltration in SARS-CoV-2-infected <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> lungs is due to reduced cytokine and chemokine levels in the lungs, we have also previously shown that even with exogenous addition of chemoattractants, <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> immune cells, particularly neutrophils, fail to travel to the inflammation site due to an inherent defect in cell movement<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Our lung histology and flow cytometry data show that neutrophil reduction in <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> and <italic>Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> mice is comparable, yet the pathology in these animals is different. Our transcriptional profiling revealed a defect in cytokine responses, cellular recruitment, and immune activation in the absence of CASP11 demonstrating that <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> neutrophils may be non-functional when compared to WT and <italic>Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> neutrophils, a notion that is supported by the lack of NETosis in <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> neutrophils. On the other hand, GSDMD, which is considered the best characterized effector of CASP11 and CASP4<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, did not contribute to the lung pathology of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice explaining why clinical trials using GSDMD inhibitors were not successful<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. In addition, our data demonstrate that IL-6 is elevated in infected lungs in a CASP11-dependent manner. IL-6 was identified during COVID-19 pandemic as being a highly upregulated mediator of disease severity in ill patients. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 can also activate the coagulation system and increase vascular permeability<sup>

</italic> expressed more VWF than those from <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, the inhibition of angiogenesis through targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been proven beneficial in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2<sup>

<p id="P22">Together, our findings suggest that targeting the CASP11 homologue, human CASP4, during COVID-19 will prevent severe pneumonia, inflammation, tissue damage as well as thrombosis and accompanying repercussions such as low oxygen, lung failure, need for ventilators and perhaps long-term sequela. These advantageous effects will be achieved without compromising viral clearance. It is also plausible that the level of expression of CASP4 could serve as a biomarker to identify patients who will succumb to severe Covid. Targeting CASP4 alone can achieve benefits that will exceed and replace the administration of a large number of individual anti-inflammatory agents and anti-thrombotics given to SARS-CoV-2 patients. Further research is needed to develop therapeutics in this regard.</p>
