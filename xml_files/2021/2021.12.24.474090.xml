In previous work, advances were achieved by increasing excitation and heuristically varying network inhibitory coupling parameters in the models. Based on these early studies, we provide a laminar NMM capable of realistically reproducing the electrical activity recorded by SEEG in the epileptogenic zone during interictal to ictal states. With the exception of the external noise input into the pyramidal cell population, the model dynamics are autonomous. By setting the system at a point close to bifurcation, seizure-like transitions are generated, including pre-ictal spikes, low voltage fast activity, and ictal rhythmic activity. A novel element in the model is a physiologically motivated algorithm for chloride dynamics: the gain of GABAergic post-synaptic potentials is modulated by the pathological accumulation of chloride in pyramidal cells due to high inhibitory input and/or dysfunctional chloride transport. In addition, in order to simulate SEEG signals for comparison with real seizure recordings, the NMM is embedded first in a layered model of the neocortex and then in a realistic physical model. We compare modeling results with data from four epilepsy patient cases. By including key pathophysiological mechanisms, the proposed framework captures succinctly the electrophysiological phenomenology observed in ictal states, paving the way for robust personalization methods based on NMMs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neural mass model</kwd><kwd>SEEG Recordings</kwd><kwd>depolarizing GABA</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Computational models have proven to be a powerful tool to understand the pathophysiology underlying epileptic activity. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], neural mass models (NMM) were used to represent realistic epileptic seizure transitions: changes from interictal to ictal state were achieved by increasing the excitatory synaptic gain at the level of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and varying the inhibitory synaptic gains of GABAergic interneurons. This model simulated the transition through some of the phases typically observed in epileptic seizures recorded with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), such as pre-ictal spikes, low voltage fast onset activity and ictal rhythmic activity.</p><p id="P3">The NMM framework describes the dynamics of the average membrane potential and firing rates of populations of neurons in a cortical column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. A NMM consists of second order differential equations describing the membrane perturbation of a neuronal population at the level of each synapse due to the input currents from another neuronal population, plus an equation converting membrane potential into firing rate using Freeman’s sigmoid function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Models of several populations can be coupled to produce different types of activity (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] for a complete description of the Jansen and Rit three population model), including epileptiform activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P4">There is increasing evidence of the role of GABAergic transmission in seizure initiation, propagation and termination, both in the immature and mature brain (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] for an extensive review). GABAergic synaptic transmission can have seizure-promoting effects when release of GABA neurotransmitters leads to excitation instead of inhibition, a phenomenon known as “depolarizing GABA”. Indeed, optogenetic control of perisomatic-targeting GABAergic interneurons such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) cells showed that high frequency discharge of this cell types was able to trigger fast onset activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and selective activation of PV cells and another sub-class of GABAergic interneurons, somatostatin-positive (SST) cells, triggered epileptiform activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Mechanistically, the dysregulation of chloride homeostasis observed in epileptic tissues appears to play a major role in the depolarizing effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> neurotransmitters during epileptic seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and there is evidence for the accumulation of chloride in pyramidal cells at seizure onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Changes in the expression level of chloride cotransporters, such as KCC2 (K-Cl cotransporter type 2) and NKCC1 (Na-K-2Cl cotransporter type 1) have been identified as the main causes for pathological chloride accumulation in the epileptic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Recently, a computational model including activity-dependent GABA depolarization was used to reproduce epileptic discharges in Dravet syndrome patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In the model, GABA depolarization was mediated by PV-cells and was represented by a parameter that was gradually increased to generate transitions from background to interictal, low voltage fast-onset seizure initiation, ictal-like activity and seizure-like activity termination.</p><p id="P7">Building on previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and on data reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], we have extended the NMM formalism to include chloride dynamics. By modeling pathological chloride accumulation in the pyramidal cell population, we can simulate autonomous, realistic epileptic seizures. Interestingly, the model accurately reproduces the sequence of complex epileptiform patterns observed during the interictal to ictal transition. The model is autonomous in the sense that it is directly driven to ictal state by random fluctuations of external stochastic input onto the pyramidal cells (which represent fluctuations of cortico-cortical or thalamo-cortical input, or neuromodulatory effects).</p><p id="P8">Developing personalized computational models that simulate brain activity during epileptic seizures is of crucial importance for a better understanding and optimization of treatments. Not only can models help identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in seizure initiation, propagation and termination, but also they can improve the efficacy of potential treatments that range from the surgical resection of epileptogenic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] to non-invasive brain stimulation. In this regard, model parameters should be fine-tuned to fit the main patient-specific features of the SEEG recordings.</p><p id="P9">The generation of realistic SEEG data to compare with real recordings requires combining the NMM framework with a physical head model that accounts for both the location of the SEEG electrode contacts and the biophysical features of the volume conductor (tissue morphology and conductivity). This combination is crucial to solve the SEEG-forward problem and hence simulate signals analogous to real SEEG signals. The present model includes a laminar architecture that represents the cortical layers of the human brain, as was done in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. We can then embed the seizure-generating NMM into a physical head model to generate SEEG-like activity during the transition from interictal to ictal state. We provide here examples of model personalization, where we compare the simulated SEEG signal with the recordings of four epilepsy patients during seizures. We also present a proof of concept of stimulation with constant weak electric fields for the reduction of seizure activity in the model.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Patient selection and data collection</title><p id="P10">The four patients included in this study required SEEG as part of usual clinical care.

In order to optimize the trade-off between time and frequency resolution, we carried out separate time-frequency representations (TFRs) of oscillatory power for slow and fast frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The TFRs allowed us to easily identify canonical features of each seizure: a fast onset characterized by low-amplitude high frequency chirp-like bursts and a rhythmic clonic phase characterized by large amplitude sustained oscillations. For each patient and seizure, we manually defined the onset and offset of the two events and estimated their duration and peak frequency. The peak frequency was obtained by spectral parametrization following the approach described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] (more details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A</xref>).</p><p id="P20"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows examples of SEEG seizure recordings for each of the four patients.

The frequency of the LVFA period was much higher for patients 1 and 3 (~100 Hz) than for patient 2 (~40 Hz). Pre-ictal spikes were recorded prior to the LVFA phase for patients 2 and 3. For Patient 4, a burst of spikes in the beta range was followed by rhythmic oscillations in all the seizures recorded.

The model developed here is such a <italic>laminar NMM</italic> consisting of populations of (i) pyramidal neurons (P), (ii) other excitatory cells (E), which represent lateral excitation by spiny stellate cells or other pyramidal neurons in layer IV, (iii) fast inhibitory interneurons (PV), such as parvalbumin-positive cells releasing GABA<sub>A</sub> and targeting the soma and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and (iv) slow inhibitory interneurons (SST), such as somatostatin-positive cells targeting the pyramidal cells apical dendrites releasing GABA<sub>A</sub>.</p><p id="P22">With regard to connectivity, the pyramidal population sends excitatory input to all other neuronal populations and receives excitatory signals from the excitatory population and inhibitory signals from the fast and slow inhibitory interneurons. The NMM also includes an external excitatory input to the main pyramidal population, which represents the input from other cortical columns or subcortical structures. Based on the extensive literature describing local connections in cortical columns, we have also included in the model autaptic self-connections in the fast inhibitory interneuron population, and synaptic connections from slow inhibitory interneurons to fast inhibitory interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The resulting circuit architecture is a slight variation of the models proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The laminar locations of each neuronal population and their synapses are derived from the available literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the complete architecture used in the present work.</p><p id="P23">We note that the proposed circuit is meant to be representative of the architecture found in an average cortical area, although we acknowledge that the neuronal populations found in some regions will differ in type, connectivity and distribution. This might be especially true for damaged cortical structures, as is the case for some of the patients included in the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We have decided for simplicity to use the same cortical architecture for all patients and to then include some parameter modifications to represent the pathological character of the epileptic tissue, such as the synaptic gain of excitatory connections or the connectivity strength of synapses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Section 2.6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We present a synapse-driven formalism, where each synapse <italic>s</italic> is described by an equation representing the conversion from an input firing rate <italic>φ<sub>n</sub></italic> from the pre-synaptic population <italic>n</italic> into an alteration of the membrane potential <italic>u<sub>s</sub></italic> of the post-synaptic neuron.

The addition of intracellular chloride dynamics to the NMM equations allows for the representation of spontaneous transitions from interictal to ictal state in an autonomous and realistic manner. This suggests that such transitions can be accounted for by the pathological accumulation of chloride inside pyramidal cells, as suggested by previous in vivo and in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].</p><p id="P93">In the model, this pathological accumulation is generated by a dysfunction in the KCC2 co-transporter system, which has been extensively reported in epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. One of the model parameters, <italic>α</italic><sub>KCC2</sub>, represents the degree of KCC2 transporter function in the simulated neuronal population, with higher values corresponding to a more functional transporter system. Increasing <italic>α</italic><sub>KCC2</sub> above a critical healthy threshold maintains the system in non-pathological background activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix E</xref>) by avoiding the pathological Cl<sup>−</sup> accumulation that leads to ictal activity. This points out to a crucial role of Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathology in the generation of seizures. Moreover, since extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation induced by glutamate spillover is susceptible to activate the calcium-sensitive calpain that leads to KCC2 cleavage and downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], every seizure is susceptible to aggravate chloride homeostasis through the alteration of KCC2 expression in the membrane. Severe dowregulation of chloride transporter may lead to constant constitutive depolarizing GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] whereas mild dowregulation could be associated with activity dependent overload of chloride in case of intense activity of GABAergic interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Both of these can be represented by the model through the <italic>α</italic><sub>KCC2</sub> parameter.</p><p id="P94">It is worth stating that the pathological expression of NKCC1 transporters in epileptic tissue, which has been also found in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], could also exacerbate the high levels of chloride concentration in the pyramidal cells of the epileptogenic area. This mechanism has not been included in the model but is thought to have a complementary effect to the one of KCC2 transporters. In a future step, NKCC1-related mechanisms could be accounted for in the model equations.</p><p id="P95">A significant novelty of this model is the link between chloride accumulation in different locations of the pyramidal population and the amplitude of the PSPs generated upon GABA release. Previous models had exploited separately either the decrease of the amplitude of synaptic inhibitory gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] or the fact that GABA release may have a depolarizing effect in epileptic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In particular, the depolarizing effect of GABA release has been observed in the clinic and in animal models in numerous studies, many of which have pointed out to the potential implication of pathological chloride accumulation in this abnormal effect of GABAergic neurotransmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. In our model, by simulating the pathological accumulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> in the cell, we link the level of chloride concentration to the magnitude of GABAergic currents, and therefore with the amplitude of synaptic inhibitory gains, and from this we are able to simulate autonomous transitions from interictal to ictal activity — a novel advance in the field. This feature of the model captures the relationship between chloride transport dysfunction, GABA depolarization and epileptic seizures, and allows for the simulation of events in a seizure with other minimal assumptions, such as the presence of PV and SST interneuron populations.</p><p id="P96">We have proposed that the depolarizing effect of GABA in the seizure onset zone may be responsible for the initiation of seizures. At first sight, this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that some drugs such as Benzodiazepine (BZD), which are positive allosteric modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, are usually effective to prevent or to stop ongoing seizures in most patients suffering focal epilepsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Clinical cases for which BZD aggravate seizures exist, but remain uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. However, it should be noted that BZD increases channel opening times and decreases the membrane resistance, prolonging shunting inhibition, and by this mechanism, retains its inhibitory effect, independently of the depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effect of GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. The mechanism of shunting inhibition has not been implemented in the current model, but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] for an example of shunting inhibition in a similar computational model.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><label>4.2</label><title>Representation of depolarizing GABA physiology in the model can shed light on phenomenology of transitions</title><p id="P97">Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the initiation of epileptic seizures, such as network excitation/inhibition imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], extracellular potassium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], or various channelopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Ours is an attempt to provide a succint, model-based insight into the potential pathophysiological mechanisms leading to seizure initiation. We have used as a starting point the discovery that excitation/inhibition imbalance in a simple NMM can reproduce the phenomenology observed in EEG and SEEG recordings during epileptic seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and we have proposed that this imbalance might be linked to the phenomenon of depolarizing GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] by including pathological Cl<sup>−</sup> dynamics in the model.</p><p id="P98">Indeed, the phenomenology of transitions in epilepsy is varied across patients, and even across seizures. The proposed model is able to capture some of the main features of these transitions, such as pre-ictal spikes, fast onset low voltage activity, or rhythmic activity. The parameter modifications required to represent some of these characteristics can be informative about the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for epileptic seizures, as we now discuss.</p><p id="P99">Low voltage fast activity (LVFA) is usually found as a marker of seizure onset in epilepsy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. This type of activity is generated in the model by a transition into a region of the parameter space where PV cells are active at very high frequencies. The transition to this region is due to decrease of IPSPs coming from SST cells, itself due to the pathological accumulation of chloride in the pyramidal cell dendrites. One should notice that the decrease of SST inhibition might also be due to the cell vulnerability or even cell death observed in several histological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. The model predicts that, next, the increased activity of somatic-targeting PV cells leads to the accumulation of chloride in the pyramidal cell soma. This in turn causes a decrease of GABAergic PSPs from PV interneurons, changing the system dynamics again, now from LVFA to rhythmic activity. Crucially, this evolution corresponds to the one presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], where the transition to seizure was explained by a decrease in inhibition from dendritic-targeting slow interneurons first, then from perisomatic-targeting fast interneurons. Here we present a physiologically realistic explanation of this evolution, based on pathological chloride accumulation during seizure: first the dendritic compartments are more affected, then the somatic ones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P100">Indeed, due to their low capacity, dendritic compartments are more susceptible to changes in chloride accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and several studies have reported excitatory effects in dendritic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors when intensely activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. Some studies have shown that optogenetic activation of PV or SST cells is equally effective in generating seizure-like activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], but others have reported that selective activation of perisomatic-targeting PV cells might be sufficient to trigger seizure-like activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Although it is unclear whether the seizure is triggered in the first place by the depolarizing effect of GABA transmission from dendritic-targeting interneurons (as predicted by the model) or from somatic-targeting cells, in our model depolarizing GABA effects on both types of cells are needed to reproduce the whole interictal to ictal transition. Moreover, the mechanistic evolution presented might explain the patterns observed in epileptic seizure transitions, notably the presence of LVFA at seizure onset prior to clonic rhythmic activity.</p><p id="P101">Pre-ictal spikes appear in the model as a transition through a phase of spiking activity as dynamics evolve from background activity to fast onset activity. Chloride accumulation in the pyramidal cell population forces this change in the dynamics, which do not stabilize in the spiking phase region because the increased activity during this phase leads to more chloride accumulation in the pyramidal cells and thus, to a decrease of the GABAergic PSPs until the system enters a region of LVFA. This scenario is found in Patient 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(b)</xref>). Thus, if the transition from background to fast onset activity takes place in a more rapid manner, for example due to a very fast accumulation of chloride in the cell, pre-ictal spikes would be unlikely to appear, as the system would not spend enough time in the spiking activity region. This is the case for Patient 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(a)</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that pre-ictal spikes reflect a relatively slow transition through a region of spiking activity in parameter space, which exacerbates chloride accumulation and leads to the transition to either rhythmic activity or LVFA.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>4.3</label><title>Modeling can characterize epileptogenic nodes in a patient-specific manner</title><p id="P102">We have provided a first methodology for the personalization of a node NMM from patient data.

This demonstrates the robustness of the model and of the personalization strategy presented, paving the way for the development of patient-specific computational models to guide invasive or non-invasive personalized treatments in epilepsy such as tDCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. As an example, several studies have used neural masses or macroscale models embedded in a brain network to predict the outcome of surgery in epileptic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. In these studies, the models of nodes placed in the epileptogenic zone are usually modified with respect to the rest of the network nodes with an increase of excitability, but they are rarely personalized based on the patient’s quantitative physiological data. The current model could be used in such network studies for a more realistic, personalized approach, where nodes in the epileptogenic zone display the phenomenology observed in physiological recordings. A network approach based on the current model is a natural next step, since our model is not only capable of reproducing seizure-like transitions, but also typical background or interictal activity (e.g., with healthy KCC2 transporters — high <italic>α</italic><sub>KCC2</sub> —, or with low excitatory input, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix E</xref>).</p><p id="P105">Moreover, the personalized model is informative about several aspects of the patient’s pathology.

Indeed, in the present work we have shown that the membrane potential signal is representative of the SEEG signal morphology at a very narrow range electrode depths, and, thus, cannot provide a full representation of the features of SEEG recordings. However, aspects of the signal such as the dominant frequencies in the different phases of the seizure are less influenced by the electrode position and can be captured by the average membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells. The spectrum of the SEEG signal is distorted across depths, but features such as frequency peaks are in general well preserved.</p><p id="P107">In view of this, and because in the clinical setting the imaging techniques used to retrieve the electrode position inside the brain are not precise enough for the purpose of SEEG morphology analysis (e.g., the resolution of computed tomography (CT) is around 0.5 mm), our personalization strategy is based on the spectral features of the signal, rather than in the morphology of the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). For the purpose of model personalization, we therefore use the average membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells, as was done in previous work.</p><p id="P108">Once the model has been personalized, however, a physical layer can be added to the NMM framework in order to achieve a more accurate representation of SEEG recordings. In recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], we have provided methods to connect microscale neuron models with the neural mass formalism and with physical models of SEEG measurements, improving the accuracy of simulated electrophysiological signals. In the present study, we have used a simplified version of such framework (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Section 2.7</xref>), which includes a laminar version of the NMM embedded in a physical model. The electrode depth has been adjusted heuristically, based on the best fit with the real SEEG data. Future work could profit from more precise imaging techniques to retrieve the SEEG electrode position accurately, which would allow for the personalization of the combined NMM and physical model based on the recorded SEEG data.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><label>4.5</label><title>The model can be used to represent the effects of brain stimulation in epileptic tissue</title><p id="P109">The aim of the computational model presented here is not only to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology behind epileptic activity, but also to help designing personalized medical treatments for the disease. One promising direction for therapeutic interventions in epilepsy is transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), especially in cases where drugs and/or surgical intervention are not effective. The design of personalized stimulation protocols can be guided by computational models, which provide a unique tool to predict the outcome of electrical stimulation on the epileptic tissue. As a first step, by simulating the effect of electric fields in a personalized model that mimics the activity in the epileptogenic tissue of a given patient, it is possible to study in silico if the epileptic activity can be reduced, or suppressed, by tES targeting the epileptogenic zone.</p><p id="P110">The study presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Section 3.4</xref> constitutes an <italic>in silico</italic> proof of concept of the effects of tDCS in epileptogenic nodes, and shows how inhibition with external electric fields can reduce or even suppress the epileptiform activity in simulated nodes. Future work includes the analysis of the effects of weak electric fields at the network level and a more precise derivation of the coupling term <italic>λ<sub>n</sub></italic>, which requires a translation of the effects of uniform weak electric fields from the microscale to the mesoscale. Work along these lines has been carried out in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], where the effects of electric fields are analyzed at the single neuron level. The emergence of exact mean field theories deriving neural mass models from microscale ones, the construction of detailed population models, as well as experimental work can all help shed some light on the proper rescaling of the coupling parameter in our models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P111">It has become apparent during the last decades that computational models of epilepsy can provide key insights for treatment of neurological diseases like epilepsy. In this work we have provided a neural mass model combining physiology and biophysics to simulate electrophysiological signals from SEEG recordings in patients. By including a dynamical mechanism for GABA depolarization, we have developed an autonomous model of realistic interictal to ictal transitions. The model can be personalized at the single epileptic node level from SEEG recordings by including also physical aspects associated with the measurement process in SEEG: to better represent electrophysiological measurements, the model captures the laminar architecture of the neocortex and can be embedded in a realistic physical head model. The development of this model paves the way for robust personalization methods in epilepsy. We have demonstrated personalization in this modeling framework analyzing SEEG data from four epilepsy patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS144150-supplement-Supplementary_Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d65aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>E.L.-S., R.S.-T., F.B., F.W., P.B. and G.R. designed research; E.L.-S., R.S.-T., E.L., M.G., P.B and G.R. performed research; R.S.-T., E.L., E.K.-E., M.Y., B.M., R.S., J.Mo. contributed new reagents or analytic tools; E.L.-S., E.L., J.Ma. and D.L.-S. analyzed data; E.L.-S. and G.R. wrote the paper.</p><p>E.L.-S., R.S.-T., E.L., B.M., R.S. and D.L.-S. work for Neuroelectrics Barcelona.

Three SEEG seizure recordings were available for Patients 1 and 2, four for Patient 3 and two for Patient 4. The representative frequency values for each patient are computed as the average over the total number seizure recordings. Grey dots represent the main frequency in the fast onset or rhythmic ictal phase for a single seizure and black dots represent the average value over seizures. The variability between seizures is lower in some patients (e.g., Patient 1) and seems more prominent in the rhythmic ictal phase.

The red and green traces in the SEEG time series indicate the periods selected for power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the LVFA and rhythmic phases respectively, shown below. For Patient 4 no LFVA phase was detected, but a frequency higher than in ictal phase (beta range) was observed at seizure onset. We have also computed the PSD for this phase, marked with an orange trace. For Patients 1 and 3, a logarithmic scale has been used in the fast onset PSD representation to capture the 100 Hz peak frequency at seizure onset. Below the PSD plots, a weighted time-frequency representation of the signal is shown, which captures the high-frequency traces at seizure onset and the transition to rhythmic activity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). The bottom panels provide a zoomed view of the signal during the ictal phase. The simulated SEEG signals have been produced by embedding the patient-specific laminar NMM in a physical cortical model. Given that different electrode depths lead to very different signal morphology (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), our main focus has been to fit the main frequency in each phase of the transition from inter-ictal to seizure. The signals displayed in the bottom panels correspond to the particular locations of the SEEG electrode in the physical model that provide a good representation of the signal morphological features.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS144150-f008"/><graphic xlink:href="EMS144150-f009"/></fig><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Simulation of tDCS effects in epileptogenic nodes.</title><p>(a) Example with the personalized model of Patient 2.
