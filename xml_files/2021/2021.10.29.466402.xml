<p id="P2">The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confers great threat to the public health. Human breastmilk is an extremely complex with nutritional composition to nourish infants and protect them from different kinds of infection diseases and also SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies have found that breastmilk exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is still unknown which component(s) in the breastmilk is responsible for its antiviral activity. Here, we identified Lactoferrin (LF), MUC1 and α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) from human breastmilk by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and in vitro confirmation that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed their antiviral activity using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system and transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP) in the Huh7.5, Vero E6 and Caco-2-N cell lines. Additionally, we found that LF and MUC1 could inhibit viral attachment, entry and post-entry replication, while α-LA just inhibit viral attachment and entry. Importantly, LF, MUC1 and α-LA possess potent antiviral activities towards not only wild-type but also variants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.1 (kappa). Moreover, LF from other species (e.g., bovine and goat) is still capable of blocking viral attachment to cellular heparan sulfate. Taken together, our study provided the first line of evidence that human breastmilk components (LF, MUC1 and α-LA) are promising therapeutic candidates warranting further development or treatingVID-19 given their exceedingly safety levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">It confers a great threat to global public health since the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since outbreak in the late of 2019, which showed close phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The high rates of human deaths and pandemic distribution worldwide have caused the collapse of health systems in many countries, especially in developing countries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the ongoing pandemic has resulted in several viral variants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. These variants may potentially alter viral transmission, pathogenicity, efficacy of drug treatment as well as the binding capacity of vaccine elicited antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. In this situation, it raises the need of several effective drugs with low toxicity to treat this disease.</p>
<p id="P4">As reported previously, COVID-19 pandemic also confers great concern of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by breastfeeding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. In addition to the report of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in human breastmilk, it was still unclear that SARS-CoV-2 could transmit to infants through breastfeeding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Several evidences in the clinic study showed that SARS-CoV-2 couldn’t transmit to infants by breastfeeding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. However, it is controversial if live SARS-CoV-2 existing in the breastmilk could still be infectious.</p>
<p id="P5">Human milk is uniquely suited to breastfeed human infants due to its nutritional composition and bioactive factors for promoting antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Breastmilk could inhibit several viruses infection, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and dengue virus. It was reported that breastmilk could not only inhibit several enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex types 1 and 2, HIV and CMV, but also showed effective activity in vitro against many non-enveloped viruses like rotavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. The lactoferrin (LF), a important component in breastmilk, could suppress SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through blocking virus to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans, raising a concern that human breastmilk can also suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Our previous study had confirmed that human breastmilk significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V) infection and have strong potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects than LF treatment alone, indicating that there are potential other factors in breastmilk also play important role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 inhibition and replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it is still unclear that which components are potential to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection in an overall study.</p>
<p id="P6">Breastmilk is an extremely complex to nourish infants and protect them from different kinds of disease. It contains more than 400 different proteins and many of them exhibit the antimicrobial activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Proteins in human milk can be divided into three groups, caseins, mucin and whey proteins. These bioactive proteins from the whey fraction include LF, mucins (MUC1and MUC4), α-lactalbumin (α-LA), lactadherin, lactoperoxidase, IgA and lysozyme (LZ) and so on<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. LF is an iron-binding protein with two molecules of Fe<sup>3+</sup> per protein and rich in human milk (1-2 g/L in mature milk, 5-10 g/L in colostrum), which relatively lower in other species such as bovine milk (0.02-0.3g/L in mature milk, 2-5 g/L in colostrum)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. As reported previously, LF is an important component to protect infants from microbes and virus infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. LZ is also known to be a key protein inhibiting bacteria and rich in human milk (0.4g/L). Lactadherin, a 46 KDa mucin associated protein, was reported that it displayed high viral receptor binding and showed specific anti-rotavirus activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. MUC1 has the antiviral activity to inhibit influenza virus infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. In addition, human milk also contains antibodies like IgG and IgA which show antiviral activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, these gave us confidence to continue to identify the anti-SARS-CoV-2 components in breastmilk and explore the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, we aimed to identify the protein components in human breastmilk by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> and verify their antiviral activity using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and trVLP system in Huh7.5, Vero E6 and Caco-2-N cell lines, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. We identified that LF, MUC1 and α-LA could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and variants infection by blocking viral entry and post-entry replication, which shed light on the important role of LF, MUC1 and α-LA derived from human milk and provide the clues for the development of antiviral drug identification and design.</p>

<title>LF, MUC1 and α-LA were identified in skimmed milk with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P8">To identify the effective factors of human skimmed milk influencing on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed mass spectrometry to identify the potential factors from the skimmed milk shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. The skimmed milk was separated by cation exchange column, anion exchange column and size exclusion column in sequence. After these column separations, we got several fractions such as SP1, SP2, SP3, Q1 and Q2, which were subsequently collected for anti-SARS-CoV-2 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B to1D</xref>). We infected the Vero E6 cells with 650 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well of SASRS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and added same ratio of SP1, SP2, SP3, Q1 and Q2 into the media, the skimmed breastmilk (A17) was used as control. One day post infection, we found that SP2, SP3 and Q2 exhibited inhibitory effects to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Then, we selected these fractions into tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis and found that LF were the potential factors for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). These data suggested that LF is the potential factor in skimmed milk inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P9">As reported in our previous publication, LF might not be the effective factor alone in breastmilk and there might be other components involving the anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Previous reports showed that some factors, such as MUC1, MUC4, lactadherin, α-LA, etc., have anti-microbe activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. To identify which of them could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, we mixed the MUC4, MUC1, α-LA, lactadherin and LF with 650 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well of SASRS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with luciferase expression, respectively. Then, the mixture was added to infect Vero E6 cell for 24h. MUC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and lactadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) were showed no suppression to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Interesting, MUC1 (0.25 μg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), α-LA (0.25 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and LF (0.25 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) showed dramatic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. In addition, we also used the GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to verify the inhibition activity of LF, MUC1 and α-LA in both Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F to 2H</xref>, all the LF, MUC1 and α-LA could suppress GFP expression, indicating that these factors in skimmed milk could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, these three factors in breastmilk were validated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>LF, MUC1 and α-LA suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the trVLP infected Caco-2-N cell system</title>
<p id="P10">To further explore these factors inhibition ability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated the effects of LF, MUC1 and α-LA on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cell culture system of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP), which expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N) and also could complete viral life cycle in the cells expression N proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Caco-2-N cells were infected with trVLP (MOI=1) and treated with LF, MUC1 and α-LA at different concentration for 96h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). After the treatment, RT-qPCR analysis of cell lysates showed a dramatic decrease in the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, GFP expressing reflecting the viral replication revealed that both LF and MUC1 could significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication with low GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although we could see the inhibition effect of α-LA on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the inhibitory ability is relatively lower, which still showed a few GFP expression even in concentration of 2 mg/ml. Consistent to the GFP results, western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that MUC1 and LF could significantly suppress the S protein expression of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The α-LA at high concentration of 2 mg/ml could also suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P11">In addition, to explore whether the LF from different species possessed inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the inhibitory effect of recombinant human LF (rLF), human isolated LF (hLF), bovine LF (bLF) and goat LF (gLF) on SARS-CoV-2 infection. The skimmed milk (A17) was used as positive control. Firstly, we tested them in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system. We infected the Vero E6 cells with 650 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well of SASRS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and treated the cells with rLF, hLF, bLF, gLF and A17 for 24h. After treatment, luciferase assay showed that all of the LFs and A17 could significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, indicating that LF from bovine and goat could also inhibit SASR-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent to the pseudovirus system, trVLP system showed that all the LFs could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in RT-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and immune microscopy analysis of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that rLF and bLF significantly suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, we found that gLF at high concentration of 2 mg/ml could be toxic to cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), while other LFs showed no toxic to cell. When treating the cells at different dosages and infecting the cells with trVLP (MOI=1) for 96 h, we found that gLF suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose dependent manner. However, CCK8 analysis showed that gLF at high concentrations exhibited high cytotoxicity to Caco-2-N cells with CC<sub>50</sub> of 5.64 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, LF, MUC1 and α-LA from human breastmilk were confirmed to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. In addition, LF from other species could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>LF, MUC1 and α-LA dose and time dependently decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in association with reduced viral RNA</title>
<p id="P12">We performed a dose-response experiment with LF, MUC1 and α-LA to assess their suppression on SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Firstly, we explored them in the trVLP system infected Caco-2-N cells. The results confirmed that the inhibitory effects of MUC1, LF and α-LA on SARS-CoV-2 infection were dose dependent and the 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) for MUC1, LF and α-LA was as low as 0.04 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), 0.08 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and 0.68 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), respectively. Surprisingly, the cytotoxic values evaluated by CCK-8 assay showed that MUC1, LF and α-LA have no cytotoxicity to the cells, even the highest concentration of MUC1(2 μg/ml), LF (2 mg/ml) and α-LA (2 mg/ml). Consistent to these results, we also tested them in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system infected Vero E6 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>, the results confirmed the inhibitory effects of MUC1 on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and exhibited that the EC<sub>50</sub> for MUC1 was as low as 0.1 μg/ml. Similarly, the EC<sub>50</sub> of LF and α-LA was as low as 0.1 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>) and 0.16mg/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p id="P13">When treating the cells with relative lower concentration of MUC1, LF and α-LA in the trVLP infected Caco-2N cells, we found that LF and MUC1 could significantly suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection at early time point and keep the inhibitory effects during the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, although α-LA inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection at early time point, the inhibitory ability decreased during the culture, suggesting that α-LA might be the inhibitor influence on the early steps of viral life cycle, such as attachment and entry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>LF and MUC1 affect viral attachment, entry and post-entry of viral replication, but α-LA decreases the viral attachment and entry</title>
<p id="P14">To explore which stage of SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle targeted by LF, MUC1 and α-LA, we treated the Caco-2-N cells with individual factors at different time point during viral infection. The cells were treated with these factors before and after viral infection. Firstly, we designed the attachment experiments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> (pre-infection treatment). In the pre-infection treatment experiments, these factors were washed away before viral infection. The levels of viral RNA were significantly lower in those group treated by MUC1, α-LA, rLF, hLF, bLF and A17 than those treated by PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, the GFP expressing results showed that cells treated with these factors nearly expressed no GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also tested them in the pseudovirus system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). Consistent reductions in the luciferase expression were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected Vero E6 and Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). These data indicated that MUC1, LF and α-LA might attach the cells to block viral attachment and entry.</p>
<p id="P15">Then, we also designed the post-infection experiment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>. In the post-infection treatment experiments, the viral RNA and GFP expression were reduced by treatment with MUC1 and LF, while α-LA treatment resulted in nearly no reduction of RNA and GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>). Consistent reductions in the luciferase expression of pseudovirus system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>) after MUC1 and LF treatment and less reduction by α-LA treatment in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D</xref>). The pseudovirus was packed based on the VSV. Thus, the post-entry replication usually reflects VSV replication. Then, we applied the VSV as control to performed the experiment as designed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>. Expectedly, MUC1, α-LA and LF also inhibited VSV replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>). These data suggested that LF and MUC1 suppress SARS-CoV-2 post-entry replication. α-LA has limited suppression on SARS-CoV-2 post-entry replication.</p>
<p id="P16">In addition, we also performed the experiment to explore if MUC1, LF and α-LA suppress viral entry. We infected trVLP into the Caco-2-N cells and pseudovirus into the Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells at 4°C for 1h, respectively. Then, we washed the virus away and changed the media supplemented with these factors until the end point of infection. Interestingly, all these factors showed potent antiviral activity as evidence by the dramatic reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>) and luciferase activity levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6F</xref>).

<title>The α-LA interferes the interaction of ACE-2 and S protein, MUC1 and LF suppresses SARS-CoV-2 attaching to the HSPG</title>
<p id="P17">To explore if MUC1, LF and α-LA interfere the interaction of ACE-2 and S protein, we performed the affinity assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>, LF and MUC1 didn’t block the interaction of ACE-2 and S protein, indicating that LF and MUC1 suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection through other ways rather than the ACE-2target. Surprisingly, α-LA could interfere SARS-CoV-2 attachment to ACE-2, showing high absorbance after α-LA treatment at low concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Moreover, it was reported that LF inhibit SARS-CoV infection through the HSPG target<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. We also performed the experiment to explore the possible same targetfor LF to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. We treated the cells with LF combined with different concentrations of heparin. We found that the inhibitory effect of LF and MUC1 on SARS-CoV-2 decreased with dose-dependent of heparin combined treatment, to the deep when 10 U/ml of heparin was added in both Huh7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D and 7F</xref>) and Vero E6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E and 7G</xref>) cells. However, when increasing the heparin to 100 U/ml, we found that the inhibitory effect increased, indicating that heparin could interfere the inhibitory effect of LF on SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P19">To further confirm that LF and MUC1 interact SARS-CoV-2 attaching HSPG, we also performed new experiments in the trVLP infected Caco-2-N cells as designed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>. as the results, we also found that MUC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>) and LF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>) rather than α-LA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7D</xref>) could interfere heparin’s inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

<title>MUC1, LF and α-LA suppress several existed mutants of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication</title>
<p id="P20">To determine whether MUC1, LF and α-LA still inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants, we constructed and packaged four SARS-CoV-2 variants of B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.1 (kappa) based on the trVLP system. The Caco-2-N cells were infected with these variants and treated with different concentration of MUC1, rLF and α-LA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). After 48 hours infection, the cells were harvested. Interestingly, MUC1, rLF and α-LA could decrease SARS-CoV-2 variants infection of B.1.1.7 (alpha) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), B.1.351 (beta) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>), P.1 (gamma) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>) and B.1.617.1 (kappa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>) in a dose dependent manner.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P21">In this study, we developed an experimental workflow based on LC-MS and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system profiling that allows for effective screening the potential components for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Of these, we identified and confirmed that LF, MUC1 and α-LA in the breastmilk significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells and trVLP infected models in Caco-2-N cells. Our study confirmed the critical role of LF and MUC1 not only in blocking viral attachment and enter to the cells but also in suppressing post-entry replication at multiple cell lines. Moreover, α-LA could only bock viral attachment and entry to the cells. These data shed a light on the groundwork for further antiviral treatment development to SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread.</p>
<p id="P22">Although many clinical studies didn’t find solid information of COVID-19 related MTCT through breastfeeding, SARS-CoV-2 positive in breastmilk still confer great concern of the safety of breastfeeding to infants from SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Chambers et al. reported that they collected the positive breastmilk from 18 infected women and tested the infectivity in the cell culture system<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. They didn’t find any viral RNA positive in the experiments, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 in the breastmilk can’t infect and transmit. Consistent to this, our previous published work also showed that even we added the live virus at relative high concentrations in the breastmilk, the virus still could not infect the cells, suggesting that human breastmilk has high quality in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. In this study, we also identified LF, MUC1 and α-LA in the milk showed high effective antiviral activity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the EC<sub>50</sub> of these factors is high way lower than their concentration in human breastmilk, suggesting the strong antiviral activity of human breastmilk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which hardly allow the possible live SARS-CoV-2 virus in the milk infect and transmit to the infants during the breastfeeding. For example, the EC<sub>50</sub> of LF to SARS-CoV-2 is 0.08 mg/ml, while the concentration of LF in human mature breastmilk and colostrum is 1-2 mg/ml and 5-10 mg/ml, respectively. That means, LF shows high concentration in breastmilk and effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 possible infection and transmission. This analysis suggested that breastmilk feeding may be safe for infants whose mother are infected with SARS-CoV-2, if the breastmilk was pumped into sterile containers and feed infants with isolation from their mother. However, it still needs further study to confirm the safety of breastfeeding to infants from SARS-CoV-2 infected mother.</p>
<p id="P23">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to RNA virus and is easy to mutate during the infection, which resulting in viral escape from antibody neutralization, vaccination, and other drugs targeting the interaction between S protein and ACE-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Surprisingly, LF, MUC1 and α-LA still could inhibit the existed mutants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.1 (kappa), indicating the strong effects and broad spectrum of these factors for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P24">Most noteworthy, our identified LF, MUC1 and α-LA are safe and available in dietary supplement<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. All these factors were reported with antiviral activity and their expression was associated with viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Reghunathan R et al. showed that LF expression upregulated during the SARS-CoV infection and blocked viral attachment through HSPG<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, Mirabelli C et al reported that LF screened from the FDA approved drugs also inhibited SASRS-CoV-2 to bind to the cells through competition with HSPG and also modulating innate immune responses to increase expression of interferon stimulated genes and TNFα<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, our study also proved that LF from different species (such as bovine and goat) also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 attachment to HSPG and post-entry replication. LF from human and bovine showed nearly no toxic to all the used cells like Huh7.5, Vero E6 and Caco-2-N cells. However, LF from goat could be toxic to cells at high concentration treatment, indicating that different species has different effects on human cells. Our previous study showed that skimmed milk could suppress the activity of RNA dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it still needs further study to analyze the exact mechanism of how LF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.</p>
<p id="P25">In addition, MUC1 is an important factor expressing in the lung airway maintaining lung function and health<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. MUC1 plays important roles in protection of host from infection by pathogens and regulating inflammatory in response to infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Lu W et al reported that MUC1 expression increased in the airway mucus of critical ill COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. MUC1 sialylated in the surface of cells has the potential to bind influenza A virus (IAV) to reduce viral ability to infection host cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Consistent to this result, our data showed that MUC1 from milk could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection through influence on both viral attachment, entry and post-entry replication. However, affinity assay showed MUC1 didn’t interfere with viral infection based on the ACE-2 target, indicating the possible other mechanism involved in the infection. Interestingly, we used the recombined MUC1 C-terminal unit (MUC1-C) without any variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region also showed high inhibitory activity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting the possible other mechanisms for MUC1 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. It has been demonstrated by many studies that MUC1 play an important role in inhibiting Toll like receptor and NOD-like receptor protein 3 dependent inflammation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. These results suggested that MUC1 could be used as a potential drug for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and related inflammation to reduce the severity of COVID-19. However, it needs more further studies to support it. As for α-LA, it seems that α-LA could only block viral attachment to the cells through interfere viral binding to ACE-2 receptor.</p>
<p id="P26">Collectively, we identified several factors from human breastmilk (LF, MUC1 and α-LA) effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and their variants infection and replication by viral attachment, entry and post-entry replication. Although our findings are promising and showed its potential role in the safety of breastmilk feeding in the clinic, further studies are still needed to confirm our findings in animal and clinical studies and further modification of these factors molecular structure for clinical usage.</p>
