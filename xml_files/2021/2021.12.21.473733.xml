<abstract>
<p id="P3">COVID-19 pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has infected hundreds of millions and caused over 5 million deaths to date. Although multiple vaccines are available, breakthrough infections occur especially by emerging variants. Effective therapeutic options such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are still critical. Here, we report the development, cryo-EM structures, and functional analyses of mAbs that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. By high-throughput single cell sequencing of B cells from spike receptor binding domain (RBD) immunized animals, we identified two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb clones that have single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity, and generated a bispecific antibody. Lead antibodies showed strong inhibitory activity against historical SARS-CoV-2 and several emerging variants of concern. We solved several cryo-EM structures at ~3 Å resolution of these neutralizing antibodies in complex with prefusion spike trimer ectodomain, and revealed distinct epitopes, binding patterns, and conformations. The lead clones also showed potent efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. We also generated and characterized a humanized antibody to facilitate translation and drug development. The humanized clone also has strong potency against both the original virus and the B.1.617.2 Delta variant. These mAbs expand the repertoire of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 270 million individuals, resulting in more than 5 millions of deaths around the globe <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Although multiple vaccines are available, breakthrough infections still occur <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, especially with variant strains. Thus, broadly effective therapeutic options are critical for medical treatment. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been effectively deployed for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. However, the emergence of mutations in spike <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> and new variant lineages calls for developing additional therapeutic interventions, including mAbs with potent and broadly neutralizing ability.</p>
<p id="P5">Certain variants affect the rate of spread and/or even the ability to evade immune recognition, potentially dampening the efficacy of antibody therapy or vaccines and have been designated by WHO and CDC as “variants of concern” (VoC) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. The B.1.1.7 lineage (Alpha variant) has an increased rate of transmission and higher mortality <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The B.1.351 lineage (Beta variant) has an increased rate of transmission, resistance to antibody therapeutics, and reduced vaccine efficacy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. The lineage B.1.617 including B.1.617.1 (Kappa variant), B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) and B.1.617.3 have emerged and became dominant in multiple regions in the world <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The B.1.617 lineage has an increased rate of transmission, shows reduced serum antibody reactivity in vaccinated individuals, and exhibits resistance to antibody therapeutics under emergency use authorization (EUA) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The Delta variant has become dominant in US and many countries across the globe <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. A newly emerged variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) with extensive mutations in the Spike gene also shows rapid transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. With these VoCs, even emergency-use authorized (EUA) mAb therapies have face challenges with resistant viral variants, causing some to be withdrawn, highlighting a need for more mAb candidates in development. Discovery of neutralizing antibodies with broad neutralizing activities or multi-specific antibodies, which can increase antibody efficacy and prevent viral escape, might improve the countermeasure arsenal against COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">The majority of pre-clinical and clinical SARS-CoV-2 mAbs were discovered utilizing the blood of COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. In comparison, immunization of mice followed by hybridoma screening is a standard method for discovering of therapeutic mAbs against viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. However, hybridoma screening for potent neutralizing mAbs from immunized mice is a slow and laborious process. The recent development of high-throughput single-cell technologies enabled direct sequencing of fully recombined VDJ sequences of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires from single cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. This technology has successfully been used to isolate human neutralizing mAbs against pathogens such as HIV, Ebola viruses, and recently SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike glycoprotein (S) mediates entry into target cells and is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 spike is a trimer in the prefusion form, consisting of three copies of S1 and S2 subunits <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. The S1 subunit is composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD) that recognizes the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell surface <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. The S2 subunit contains the fusion peptide, along with other key regions, to induce membrane fusion of the virus and the target cell <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Spike RBD is flexible, moving between “up” and “down” conformations but only binds to ACE2 in the up conformation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Previous studies have suggested that most of the potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target spike RBD through an interface directly overlapping with the ACE2-binding surface <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">Here, we report the rapid identification of highly potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs using high-throughput single-cell BCR sequencing from mice immunized with purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We generated a bispecific antibody with two antigen-recognition variable regions from two of the top mAb clones against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These monospecific and bispecific antibodies displayed high affinity and avidity to the RBD antigen, and potently neutralized historical and B.1.617 lineage viruses. We also generated and characterized a humanized antibody to facilitate clinical development, and showed strong potency against both the original virus and the Delta variant, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We resolved the three-dimensional cryo-EM structures of these neutralizing antibodies in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer, which showed the epitopes as well as the combinations of open and close RBD conformations of trimeric spike bounded to the mAbs. Structure-based mutation and epitope analysis revealed the neutralization potency of the lead mAb clones against B.1.617 variants.</p>

<title>Single cell BCR sequencing of RBD-immunized mice identified enriched BCRs encoding strong mAbs against SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P9">To generate potent and specific mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, we immunized two different mouse strains: C57BL/6J and BALB/c with RBD protein with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag following a standard 28-day immunized protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Using anti-mouse CD138 beads, we isolated progenitor B cells and plasma B cells from spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow of selected immunized mice that showed high serum binding titers against RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We performed single cell VDJ (scVDJ) sequencing on the isolated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). The scVDJ data revealed the landscape of immunoglobulin clonotypes in immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>), and identified enriched IgG1 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>). We took the VDJ sequences 11 top-ranked IgG1+ clones by clonal frequency. We then cloned the paired variable region of heavy and light chain into human IgG1 (hIgG1) heavy and light chain backbone vectors separately, for antibody reconstruction utilizing the Expi293F mammalian expression system.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Anti-Spike RBD monoclonal antibodies have single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity</title>
<p id="P10">After expression and purification of hIgG1 antibody clones, we tested their reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD by ELISA. Eight of the eleven mAbs showed positive RBD-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). We then screened mAb clones showing high RBD ELISA positive rate for their neutralizing ability using an HIV-1-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system and a VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Two mAbs, Clones 2 and 6, showed strongest binding and neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a-c</xref>). As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate and evolve, leading to variants, it is critical to prevent viral escape from antibody recognition. To overcome this problem, antibody combinations from two or more mAbs have been developed and utilized <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. As an alternative, a single bispecific mAb can be used, as it can recognize two epitopes. One advantage of bispecific mAbs is that a single antibody product can be manufactured instead of two separate mAbs, which in theory could reduce the cost and formulation complexity. Thus, we generated a bispecific antibody using the antigen-specific variable regions of both Clones 2 and 6 (named as Clone 16). To generate the bispecific antibody, we utilized (i) a “knobs into holes” (KiH) methodology, and (ii) a CrossMAb-KiH bispecific backbone, to ensure the correct heterodimerization of the two different heavy chains, and (iii) a CH1 and CL exchange in heavy and light chain of one-half IgG to ensure correct pairing of heavy and light chains of each variable region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). We validated the antigen-specificity of the bispecific antibody along with its two parent mAbs using ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To characterize the biophysical nature of the RBD reactivity of lead clones, we performed biolayer interferometry (BLI) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-e</xref>). BLI results showed that Clones 2 and 6 bound to the RBD with picomolar level dissociation constant (Kd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The binding is particularly strong so that the dissociation stage was never observed in the BLI assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). SPR using an NTA-CHIP based assay with the RBD-antigen immobilized also revealed picomolar level dissociation constant (Kd) for Clones 2 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In the NTA-CHIP, where the RBD-antigen is immobilized, multiple binding events can occur, leading to potential trimer formation of RBD protein and measurement of avidity. In parallel, we performed SPR with an Fc-CHIP based assay with pre-coated antibodies, which measures monovalent binding between RBD and the antibody. Results from Fc-CHIP SPR assay revealed strong affinity with single-digit nanomolar Kd of Clone 2 and Clone 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). A humanized Clone 2 (named Clone 13) maintained strong binding affinity to RBD at low-double-digit nanomolar Kd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The bispecific Clone 16 also displayed high affinity to RBD also at single-digit nanomolar Kd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), although not significantly higher than either parental clone alone.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structures of lead antibody clones bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike define epitopes and binding conformations</title>
<p id="P12">We then generated Fab fragments of the lead clones and determined the cryo-EM structures of Clone 2 or 6 Fabs in complex with the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (S trimer) at ~3 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In both cases, a S trimer is bound with three Fab molecules, one per RBD in various conformations. In total, we determined five different Fab-S trimer complex structures, each with the S trimer in a specific conformational state. Clone 2 Fab binds to S trimer in two states, one with 2 RBDs in the up conformation (60% of all complexes) and one with all 3 RBDs up (40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Clone 6 Fab binds to S trimer in three states, one with all 3 RBDs down (26% of all complexes), one with 1 RBD up (43%) and one with 2 RBDs up (31%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, Clones 2 and 6 Fab molecules are capable of recognizing SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in all possible RBD conformations, potentially reducing viral immune evasion when used in combination or as a bi-specific. Within each clone, the same Fab-RBD binding interface is maintained regardless of the RBD conformations across all S trimer states. Between the two clones, the Fab-RBD interfaces are different, although the two Fab clones bind RBD in similar locations with RBD adopting virtually the same conformation (RMSD 0.46 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Clone 2 Fab-S trimer complexes appear more flexible than Clone 6 complexes, as indicated by less well-defined cryo-EM density in the Clone 2 Fab-RBD regions.</p>
<p id="P13">Besides the major Fab-RBD interfaces described above, in the Clone 6 Fab complexes with 2 or 3 RBDs down, a down-RBD-binding Fab makes an additional contact to a side surface of an adjacent down-RBD to lock both RBDs in the closed conformation incompetent in ACE2 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref> <bold>left two panels</bold>), which may provide a second neutralization mechanism. The additional contact is achieved by the CDRL1 loop of Clone 6 Fab that protrudes in between the two neighboring down-RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), along with the framework region 3 (FWR3) of the Fab that interacts a nearby side surface of the adjacent down-RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>, <bold>left two panels</bold>). In addition, in all complexes with 2 up/1 down-RBDs and the Clone 6 Fab complex with 2 down/1 up-RBDs, a down-RBD-binding Fab contacts the side surface of an adjacent up-RBD through another conserved interface mainly involving the CDRL1 loop of the Fabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>), further stabilizing the conformation of the adjacent up-RBDs. These types of bivalent interactions are not observed for the up-RBD-binding Fabs.</p>
<p id="P14">Clone 2 and Clone 6 Fabs interact with spike RBD at similar locations, as both directly block access of the host receptor ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Clone 6 Fab shields the entire top surface of spike RBD (both “left shoulders” and “right ridge”), whereas Clone 2 Fab has a relative rotation of ~17° pivoted on the RBD right ridge, resulting in a larger contact area there and less contact with the RBD left shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). When overlaying a Clone 2 Fab-bound down-RBD onto a Clone 6 Fab-bound down-RBD in the S trimer with more than one RBDs down, spatial clashes are detected between the Clone 2 Fab and the neighboring down RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). This also explains why we did not observe Clone 2 Fab-bound S trimer in a conformation state with more than one RBD down. In each case, all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the Fab participate in RBD interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The 3 CDRH loops of the two clones share similar overall conformations and interact mainly with the right ridge of spike RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <bold>upper panel</bold>). The 3 CDRH loops of Clone 2 Fab form a large positively charged paratope, complementing a negatively charged epitope contributed by the right ridge of spike RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>, upper panels). The 3 CDRH loops of Clone 6 Fab engage spike RBD predominantly through hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>, upper left), with the CDRH3 loop also engaging RBD through modest electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>, upper right).</p>
<p id="P15">In contrast to the relatively conserved binding locations by the CDRH loops, the 3 CDRL loops of Clones 2 and 6 diverge in RBD-binding paratopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <bold>lower panel</bold>). CDRL1 and CDRL3 of Clone 2 Fab primarily contact the epitopes at RBD right ridge and the CDRL2 loop engages RBD central groove, whereas CDRL3, CDRL1 and CDRL2 of Clone 6 Fab complement with the RBD right ridge, central groove and left shoulder, respectively, together covering the top surface of the RBD. Both Clones 2 and 6 Fab CDRL loops contact spike RBD primarily through hydrophobic interactions along with modest electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5a</xref>, lower panels). A comparison of the Clone 2 and Clone 6 Fabs revealed that the most different region comes from the CDRH3 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The Clone 6 Fab contains a longer CDRH3 loop, which inserts into the central groove of spike RBD to generate a tighter engagement. As a consequence, this induces a substantial change in the RBD, which otherwise maintained a nearly identical conformation, where residue F486 flips to contact the CDRL3 loop of Clone 6 instead of interacting with the CDRH3 loop of Clone 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Even though the two Fabs interact with the RBD with similar buried surface areas (949 Å<sup>2</sup> in Clone 2 vs. 894 Å<sup>2</sup> in Clone 6), the further spread-out RBD-binding mode of Clone 6 Fab is more similar to that of host ACE2 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>

<title>Epitope and mutation analysis of the mAb:RBD structures on binding interface between the lead mAbs and hotspot mutations in Beta and Delta variants</title>

The Beta variant encodes three mutations (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) in spike RBD. Although N501 is not located within the epitope region, the Y501 mutation may have weak interactions with the CDRL2 loop of both Fab clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, lower left). K417 has no contact with Clone 2 Fab, but interacts with the CDRL1 loop of Clone 6 Fab, and the K417N mutation would likely abolish this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, lower left). E484, which is located on top of the RBD right ridge, is targeted by the CDRH1 and CDRH3 loops of both Fab clones, and has a larger contact area on Clone 6 Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, upper left).

In contrast, all mice receiving treatment of either Clone 2 (8/8, 100%) or Clone 6 (7/7, 100%) maintained their body weight throughout the duration of the study and survived SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-e</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has necessitated the rapid development of therapeutic interventions. The discovery and development of neutralizing antibodies with expanding collections of epitopes are critical to provide countermeasure options against escape seen with emerging variants of concern. We combined SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD protein immunization with high-throughput single cell BCR sequencing technology to establish a platform to develop neutralizing antibody candidates. We identified two highly potent and specific SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb clones with single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity. We also generated a bispecific antibody of these two lead clones, as well as a potent humanized clone. The lead antibodies showed strong neutralization ability against SARS-CoV-2 and the highly transmissible B.1.617 lineage that poses a risk of reducing the efficacy of currently available therapeutic antibodies and prophylactic vaccines.</p>
<p id="P25">The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is dynamic, and three conformations of spike prefusion trimers have been detected on intact virions: all RBDs down, 1 RBD up, and 2 RBDs up, with the last one only existing in vitro with multiple stabilizing mutations <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. The spike RBD needs to extend upwards to be accessible to ACE2, and the presence of host ACE2 changes the population distribution of different spike conformations by promoting the RBD towards the up/open state favorable for ACE2 binding <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. Genetic variations in spike can also change the conformational equilibrium of the trimer, subsequently affecting virus infectivity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. Although antibody therapy has been developing rapidly prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2, infection, the precise determinants of neutralization potency remain unclear. In addition to direct receptor blockade by antibody binding, modulation of spike-mediated membrane fusion by altering the ACE2-triggered spike protein conformational cycle has been suggested as another determinant of the antibody neutralization potency<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P26">Depending on the binding mode, some antibodies may facilitate the spike conformational cycle to the final stage with all 3 RBDs open, or lock the spike trimer in a pre-fusion state, therefore enhancing or inhibiting the cell membrane fusion and syncytium formation. Based on our cryo-EM analysis, Clone 6 Fab binds to spike trimer preferentially with at least one RBD down, and effectively skews the spike trimer towards pre-fusion states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Besides making two neighboring down-RBDs inaccessible for ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c and 4d</xref>, left panels), a down-RBD-binding Clone 6 Fab can also interact with an adjacent up-RBD through a quaternary epitope located at the side wall of the up-RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>, right), which clashes with ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>, right), thereby directly blocking ACE2 access to two RBDs simultaneously. This bipartite binding mode presumably is more stable than the single binding mode with the up-RBD alone, explaining why no spike trimer with all 3 RBDs open was detected when complexed with Clone 6 Fab. We hypothesize that the Clone 6 Fab binding to this secondary epitope of RBD helps lock the spike trimer in the pre-fusion form, which inhibits the spike-mediated cell membrane fusion by historical virus and even the B.1.1.7 variant that has enhanced binding affinity to ACE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d-e</xref>, middle). In contrast, due to the different binding conformations of Clone 2 Fab on spike RBD, the spike trimer has been detected in skewed states that favorite RBDs up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), which mimics the effect of ACE2 binding during the conformational cycle of the spike trimer. Nonetheless, we found that Clone 2 Fab also efficiently suppresses spike-mediated cell-cell fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d-e</xref>, left), suggesting that the mechanism determining the neutralization potency of spike-targeting antibody is complex.</p>
<p id="P27">Antibody resistance of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617 lineage variants has been reported <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 spike contains a single mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, which has been reported to enhance the spike RBD-ACE2 binding affinity that could disfavor antibody neutralizations competing with ACE2 for RBD binding <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. N501 does not directly interact with either Clone 2 or Clone 6 Fab, although the mutation may generate allosteric effects on other CDRL loops nearby to disrupt the binding interface <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. While the B.1.1.7 variant spreads faster, has higher case-fatality rate, and some antibody resistance, it does not reduce the efficacy of the currently approved vaccines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>

In addition to the N501Y mutation, the B.1.351 variant has two additional point mutations K417N and E484K in spike RBD, which perturbs the RBD epitope recognition by both antibody clones, explaining their reduced potencies against the B.1.351 variant. The lineage B.1.617 has mutations in spike including G142D, E154K, L452R, E484Q, D614G, P681R, and Q1071H <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. L452R and S477N might affect the potency of Clones 2 and 6 to some degree based on the structure.</p>
<p id="P28">Several therapeutic antibodies have been granted EUA for clinical use by the FDA, such as two from Regeneron developed in a previous study <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>

To better understand impact of Delta mutations on antibody neutralization potency, we performed structural; analysis with the Delta RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). The epitopes of REGN-10987 centered around the RBD left shoulder loop on the β1 end, which hereafter we termed left shoulder loop 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Clone 2 primarily targets a region at the right ridge of RBD. The L452R mutation of Delta is on the C-terminus edge of the left shoulder loop 1 and is critical for the loop 1 conformation. L452R is observed to favor an orientation interacting with the Y351 and is likely to disrupt the original conformation of left should loop 1, consistent with the reduction of the affinity and potency of the REGN-10987 antibody. The E484Q, on the other hand, was not observed to significantly change side chain orientation and is less likely to cause drastic conformational changes on nearby loops. The mutation induced side-chain orientation as well as nearby loop conformation change plus distinct antibody targeting epitopes are consistent with the observation that Clone 2 retained its neutralization potency against Delta, whereas REGN-10987 did not.</p>
<p id="P29">In summary, in a concerted global effort against COVID-19, a number of candidate therapeutics, antibodies, and vaccines have been developed to date <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>
</sup>. Our lead antibody clones are distinct different from existing antibodies reported to date in their binding geometry and footprints, are highly inhibitory against SARS-CoV-2 and several variants of concerns, particularly the Delta variant from the B.1.617 lineage. These antibodies thus expand the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen and its emerging and potentially more dangerous variants.</p>

First, all mice are ear-marked and around 200 μl blood was taken as pre-immunization sample, where serum was collected from the blood by centrifugation (1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min). Two days later (day 0), for each mouse, 20 μg SARS-CoV-2 RBD-his tag protein (Sino biological) in 100 μl PBS was mixed with 100 μl Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) with 3-way stop Cock. The fully emulsified mixture was subcutaneously injected into the back of each mouse. On day 7, a second immunization was performed, where each mouse was injected subcutaneously with 20 μg RBD-his tag protein fully emulsified with Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA). On day 13, around 50 μl of blood from each mouse was obtained for serum preparation as first bleeds. On day 14, a third immunization is performed, where all the procedures were similar to the second immunization. On day 20, second bleeds were taken. On day 21, forth immunization is performed, where all the procedures were similar to the second immunization. On day 24, each mouse receives 20 μg RBD-his tag protein in 200 μl PBS intraperitoneally as final immunization. On day 28, mice with strong serum conversion detected by ELISA were sacrificed. Spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow were collected for B cells isolation and purification for single cell BCR sequencing. Serums from pre, first and second bleeds were subjected to ELISA for anti-RBD tilter determination.</p>

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p id="P35">The cDNA sequences of the paired variable heavy and light chain region of anti-RBD antibody clones were synthesized as gBlocks (IDT) and cloned by the Gibson assembly (NEB) into human IgG1 heavy chain and light chain expression plasmids, pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1(InvivoGen, pfusess-hchg1) and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK (InvivoGen, pfuse2ss-hclk), respectively. pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 plasmid is a cloning plasmid that expresses the constant region of the human IgG1 heavy chain and includes multiple cloning sites to enable cloning of the heavy chain (CH) variable region. Parallelly, pFUSE2-CLIg-hK is a cloning plasmid that expresses the constant region of the human kappa light chain and contains multiple cloning sites to enable cloning of the light chain variable region. For anti-RBD antibody clones’ heavy chain plasmid cloning, gBlocks, containing cDNA sequence of variable region of heavy chain of anti-RBD antibody clones and the regions overlapping with corresponding flanking sequences of EcoRI and NheI restriction sites pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1, were ordered from IDT. pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 were digested with EcoRI and NheI restriction enzyme (ThermoFisher). These synthesized gBlocks were cloned into gel-purified restriction enzyme digested backbone by the Gibson assembly (NEB). For anti-RBD antibody clones’ light chain plasmid cloning, gBlocks, containing cDNA sequence of variable region of light chain of anti-RBD antibody clones and the regions overlapping with corresponding flanking sequences of EcoRI and BsiWI restriction sites pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK, were ordered from IDT.

The bi-specific antibody consists of two hetero-half IgG1, one is knob IgG1 and the other is hole IgG1 (Knob-in-Hole conformation). Four plasmids were employed: pFUSE2ss-knobLight-hK, pFUSE2ss-knobheavy-hG1, pFUSE2ss-HoleLight-hK, pFUSE2ss-HoleHeavy-hG1. The pFUSE2ss-knobLight-hK is pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK with no further editing. The pFUSE2ss-knobheavy-hG1 contains two knob mutations (T366W, S354C) in the CH3 region when compared with pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1. The gBlock (pPR024), containing constant region of heavy chain with two knob mutations and the regions overlapping with corresponding flanking sequences of NsiI and NheI restriction sites in pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 was ordered from IDT, and then cloned into NsiI and NheI restriction enzymes digested pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 backbone by the Gibson assembly (NEB). The pFUSE2ss-HoleLight-hK was generated by replacing the constant region of Light chain (CL) in pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK with CH1 region of heavy chain in pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 vector. The CH1 region were PCR amplified from pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1vectors with a forward primer (oPR81-F) and a reverse primer (oPR82-R) containing regions overlapping with corresponding flanking sequences of the and NcoI and NheI restriction sites in the pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK. CH1 PCR amplified fragments were gel-purified and cloned into restriction enzyme digested pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK by the Gibson assembly (NEB). The pFUSE2ss-HoleHeavy-hG1 possesses three “hole” mutations (T366S, L368A, Y407V) in the CH3 region and a Y349C on the “hole” side to form a stabilizing disulfide bridge. In addition, to get the correct association of the light chain and the cognate heavy chain, the CH1 region in the pFUSE2ss-HoleHeavy-hG1 was exchanged with constant region of light chain (CrossMab conformation). The gBlock (pPR023), containing cDNA sequence of constant region of light chain, CH2 and CH3 with “hole” mutations, and regions overlapping with corresponding flanking sequences of NsiI and NheI restriction sites in pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 was ordered from IDT, and cloned into NsiI and NheI restriction enzymes digested pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 backbone through Gibson assembly (NEB).

All procedures were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 mg the whole IgGs of Clone 2 and Clone 6 were digested with immobilized papain at 37 °C for 4 hr with rotation. Then protein A beads were applied to bind the Fc fragments and undigested IgG. Then Fab fragments were recovered in the flow-through fraction, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in 30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. The mondispersed peak of Fab fragments was pooled and concentrated for subsequent analysis.</p>

<p id="P63">A total of 2,655 and 1,766 movie series were collected for Clone 2 Fab-S trimer complex and Clone 6 Fab-S trimer complex, respectively. The same data processing procedures were carried out for each complex as described below. Motion correction of the micrographs was carried out using RELION <sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>
</sup> produced similar results. For each state of the Clone 6 Fab-S trimer complex, multibody refinements were then carried out in RELION by dividing the complex into individual rigid bodies (3 refinements each with a rigid body containing a unique Fab, RBD, and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike S1 subunit, and another rigid body for the rest of the spike ectodomain trimer). For each state of the Clone 2 Fab-S trimer complex, local masked 3D classification without image alignment was performed focusing on one Fab-RBD region and the best class of particles was selected for consensus refinement of the whole complex. Subsequently, multibody refinement was performed as described above for the rigid body containing the focused region. The 3D reconstruction of the other Fab-RBD regions were obtained with the same procedure. The final resolution of each reconstruction was determined based on the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) cutoff at 0.143 between the two half maps <sup>
