However, despite clear similarities between the two cell types, it is likely they are not identical. In this study, we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors. We find that while hESCs and hiPSCs express a near identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the expression levels of a wide subset of proteins.</p><p id="P6">hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs. The proteomic data show hiPSCs have significantly increased abundance of vital cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins, which correlated with phenotypic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Thus, higher levels of glutamine transporters correlated with increased glutamine uptake, while higher levels of proteins involved in lipid synthesis correlated with increased lipid droplet formation. Some of the biggest metabolic changes were seen in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism, with corresponding enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown experimentally using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins, including ECM components and growth factors, some with known tumorigenic properties, as well as proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. Our data indicate that reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPSCs effectively restores protein expression in cell nuclei to a state comparable to hESCs, but does not similarly restore the profile of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins, with consequences for cell phenotypes affecting growth and metabolism. The data improve understanding of the molecular differences between induced and embryonic stem cells, with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>hESC</kwd><kwd>TMT</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>protein content</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are derived from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. They show prolonged undifferentiated potential, as well as the ability to differentiate into the three main embryonic germ layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, making them excellent models for studying disease mechanisms, development and differentiation. However, their use remains restricted by regulations, based in part upon ethical considerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Over a decade ago, methods allowing the induction of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblast cultures, in both human and mice, were developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These reports showed that by exogenously expressing a small set of key transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4), a somatic cell could be reprogrammed back into a pluripotent state, characterised by their capacity for self-renewal and ability to differentiate into the three main germ layers. These human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show many key features of their physiological embryonic stem cell (hESC) counterparts, while avoiding many of the ethical issues regarding the use of stem cells derived from embryos.</p><p id="P9">Since the discovery of reprogramming methods, hiPSC lines have attracted great interest, particularly for their potential use as alternatives to hESCs in regenerative medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and disease modelling, including studies on monogenic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and some late onset diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, to understand the value of using hiPSCs in regenerative therapy, drug development and/or studies of disease mechanisms, it is important to establish how similar hiPSCs are to hESCs at the molecular and functional levels. To address this, multiple studies have compared hiPSCs and hESCs, using a variety of assays, including methylation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, transcriptomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and even quantitative proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. It should be noted, however, that many of these earlier studies were performed at a time when reprogramming protocols were less robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and when the depth of proteome coverage and quantitative information that could be obtained was lower than today.</p><p id="P10">In this study, we have addressed the similarity of hiPSCs to hESCs by performing a detailed proteomic analysis, comparing a set of four hiPSC lines derived from human primary skin fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> of independent, healthy donors, with four independent hESC lines. The data highlight that while both types of stem cell lines have very similar global protein abundance profiles, they also show some specific and significant quantitative differences in protein expression. In particular, the reprogramed iPSC lines consistently display higher total protein levels, predominantly affecting cytoplasmic proteins required to sustain higher growth, along with mitochondrial changes, and an excess of secreted proteins, with impact upon cell phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>hESCs and hiPSCs display quantitative differences in protein abundances</title><p id="P11">For this study, we compared multiple hESC and hiPSC lines, all derived from different donors and cultured using identical growth conditions. First, the expression levels of the main pluripotency markers were verified in each of the lines, with no differences detected between the respective hESC and hiPSC cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). From these data, representative sets of four hiPSCs and four hESCs lines were selected for detailed proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. The proteomes were characterised using tandem mass tags (TMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, within a single 10-plex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>) and using MS3-based synchronous precursor selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (SPS). To further optimise quantification accuracy, each sample was allocated to a specific isobaric tag to minimise cross-population reporter ion interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In total 8,491 protein groups (henceforth referred to as ‚Äòproteins‚Äô), were detected at 1% FDR, with &gt;99% overlap between the proteins detected from both the hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, it is important to highlight that TMT is not the best method to use when looking for proteins that are specific to one condition or population, as protein detected in one channel are frequently seen across all other channels as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">To provide a quantitative comparison of the respective proteomes, we focussed on analysing the 7,878 proteins that were detected with at least 2 unique and razor peptides (see methods). After confirming that there were no differences in the abundance levels of histones between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), protein copy numbers were estimated via the ‚Äúproteomic ruler‚Äù<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (see methods). The copy number data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) highlighted that both the hESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and hiPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), proteomes display a similar dynamic range, with estimated protein copy numbers extending from a median of less than 100 copies, to over 100 million copies per cell. Furthermore, the composition of the respective proteomes is highly similar. Both cell types display high expression levels of ribosomal proteins, protein chaperones and glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f&amp;g</xref>), consistent with rapid proliferation and dependence on glycolysis for energy generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. It is only when the quantitative data are examined in more detail that differences between the cell types become apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). A principal component analysis (PCA), based on the protein copy numbers, revealed a clear separation between the two stem cell populations within the main component of variation, which accounted for 69% of variance. The PCA suggested that the independent hiPSC lines were clearly different to the hESC lines, and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Standard normalisation methods mask changes in total protein content in hiPSCs compared to hESCs</title><p id="P13">A previous proteomic study reported that there were virtually no protein level differences between hESCs and hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, in that study the intensity data were median normalised. We therefore decided to compare two different normalisation methods: i.e., the previously used median normalisation method and the ‚Äúproteomic ruler‚Äù<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The median normalisation produces concentration-like results and is frequently used to normalise proteomic data. With this approach, our data also show no major differences in protein abundances between the hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 2</xref>), i.e. ~94% of all proteins displayed no significant changes in abundance (FC&gt;1.5-fold; q-value &lt; 0.001), similar to the previously reported conclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, median (or total intensity) normalisation methods lack the capacity to detect changes in absolute abundance, cell size or protein content. By artificially forcing all medians to be almost identical, such changes are invisible.</p><p id="P14">This is not the case for the results produced with the ‚Äúproteomic ruler‚Äù<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The copy number-based analysis enables an approximation to absolute protein abundance and can reveal changes in cell mass, as we previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Using the proteomic ruler method highlighted systematic differences between hESCs and hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Table 3</xref>), with 56% (4,426/7,878) of all proteins detected significantly increased in hiPSCs (FC&gt;1.5-fold; q-value &lt; 0.001) and with particular enrichment in translation-related processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, only 40 proteins (0.5%) showed significantly lower expression levels in hiPSCs. With thousands of proteins displaying higher abundance, we hypothesised that hiPSCs have higher total protein content, compared to hESCs. Using the protein copy numbers to estimate the total protein content showed that hiPSCs had &gt;50% higher protein content compared to hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To validate this observation, an independent assay (EZQ‚Ñ¢ assay; see methods), was used to measure the total protein yield from similar numbers of freshly grown hiPSCs and hESCs. From these experiments, the calculated protein amount per million cells was &gt;70% higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; p-value=0.0018) in hiPSCs, relative to hESCs. We conclude that hiPSCs have a higher total protein content.</p><p id="P15">Changes in protein content could potentially be linked to differences in the cell cycle profile. Hence, to test this, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to study the cell cycle distribution of hESCs and hiPSCs. The FACS data showed that hiPSCs have significantly higher forward scatter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), correlated to increased cell size, as well as significantly higher side scatter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), correlating to increased cell granularity. However, the FACS analysis revealed no significant differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the percentage of cells at each of the cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We conclude that hiPSCs have significantly higher total protein content, with increased size and granularity, but that these differences with hESCs are independent of changes in cell cycle distribution.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>hiPSCs have elevated nutrient transporters, metabolic proteins, and protein and lipid synthesis machinery</title><p id="P16">To maintain a higher protein content than hEScs with a comparable cell cycle profile, hiPSCs would require higher protein synthesis capacity, which in turn requires increased access to nutrients and energy. Energy metabolism in primed pluripotent stem cells is largely dependent on glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which is sensitive to glucose uptake and lactate shuttling. Therefore, we compared the expression of the respective glucose and lactate transporters between hiPSCs and hESCs. The data showed both main glucose transporters, GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and GLUT3 (SLC2A3), had higher abundance in hiPSCs, as did the lactate transporters SLC16A1 and SLC16A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Other rate limiting enzymes, including Hexokinase 1 (HK1) and 2 (HK2) were also significantly increased within hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting increased glycolytic potential.</p><p id="P17">Nutrient uptake is mostly handled by the SLC (solute carrier), group of membrane transporters. Analysis of the 15 SLC transporters that are most upregulated in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs, showed that they mostly belonged to two categories, i.e., amino acid and mitochondrial transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Amino acids are vital to sustain high rates of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and the data showed that 11/12 amino acid transporters were significantly increased in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs, including the hyper abundant protein SLC3A2, which is present at &gt;4 million copies per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The highest fold increases, (&gt;4-fold), were seen for SLC38A1 and SLC38A2, both of which are major glutamine transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">We next examined whether the increased abundance of the glutamine transporters had phenotypic impact, i.e., whether it correlated with increased glutamine uptake within hiPSCs. To test this hypothesis, we measured the uptake of radio-labelled glutamine in both hiPSCs and hESCs (see methods). The data showed that hiPSCs had a median of &gt;90% higher uptake of glutamine, compared to hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Glutamine has been reported to be the most consumed amino acid in hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and its catabolism to be one of the vital metabolic pathways that can provide ATP and more importantly biosynthetic precursors, required to sustain growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Hence, we also explored the abundance of enzymes involved in glutaminolysis and found that vital proteins, including GLS, GLUD1, GPT2 and GOT2, were also significantly higher in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Having established that hiPSCs have increased expression of nutrient transporters and higher expression of enzymes in key metabolic pathways, compared with hESCs, we next looked at the machinery required for protein synthesis. The levels of many of the proteins involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis, including ribosomal proteins, were higher in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). The increased expression of translation machinery components, nutrient transporters and many metabolic enzymes, is consistent with the increased total protein content seen within hiPSCs.</p><p id="P20">The data also highlighted increased fatty acid (FA) and lipid droplet (LD) synthesis potential in hiPSCs, with increased abundance of the protein SREBP1 (SREBF1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), a master regulator of lipid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, as well as FASN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>) and SCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). Similarly, a crucial regulator for LD assembly, PLIN3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>), displayed &gt;2-fold increased abundance in hiPSCs. To examine the potential phenotypic impact of this increased abundance of proteins involved in LD synthesis, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses to compare hiPS and hES cells. This showed that LDs were clearly visible in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>), but not visible in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3m</xref>). We conclude that the hiPSCs have elevated levels of LDs, resulting from the increased expression of proteins involved in lipid synthesis and LD assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>hiPSCs show altered mitochondrial metabolism compared to hESCs</title><p id="P21">Our data also highlighted important changes in mitochondrial proteins, including increases in the levels of metabolic proteins that are encoded within the mitochondrial genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The latter proteins, which are translated by specialised mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes), are embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. The protein components of mitoribosomes also showed increased expression in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), along with virtually all proteins involved in the translation initiation, elongation and termination of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The analysis of transporter proteins revealed a cluster of 22/27 mitochondrial transporters that were significantly increased in hiPSCs, including the hyper abundant, (&gt;10 million copies per cell), ATP/ADP transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). A subset of 14 transporters displayed &gt;2-fold increased abundance, including the acylcarnitine transporter SLC25A20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), which is part of the carnitine shuttle in the beta oxidation pathway. Another component of the carnitine shuttle, CPT1A, displayed over 4-fold higher abundance in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), suggesting an important role. The data showed it was not just fatty acid oxidation, but also synthesis, that was affected, with proteins acting in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mFAS) pathway also increased in abundance. MCAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), MECR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) and OXSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>), all displayed ~2-fold higher abundance in hiPSCs compared to hESCs. These results have a metabolic relevance as mFAS has been reported to control the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which was also increased in hiPSCs, with subunits of all 5 ETC complexes increased in abundance in hiPSCs and with complex II and complex III showing the most prominent effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). Complex II is also part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which displayed increased abundance of the majority of proteins involved in the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>).</p><p id="P23">As the proteomic data showed clear differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the levels of mitometabolism proteins, we performed experiments to explore whether this was reflected in phenotypic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. This was tested using high-resolution respirometry (see Methods). The data showed that hiPSCs had a higher P/E control ratio to hESCs, which denotes an increased capacity of the phosphorylation system to produce ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4l</xref>). We conclude that hiPSCs have elevated levels of mitometabolism proteins relative to hESCs, resulting in higher respiratory activity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>hiPSCs upregulate secreted proteins affecting their microenvironment</title><p id="P24">Among the most upregulated proteins in hiPSCs were a subset of secreted proteins. Secreted proteins are of great importance because changes in their absolute abundance can affect the extracellular environment. These secreted proteins mostly represented 4 categories: structural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, growth factors, protease inhibitors and proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The ECM both provides physical support for cells, as well as actively participating in cell signalling by providing domains for growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The ECM can also be reshaped in tumours, thereby promoting cancer cell growth and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The current data show that both laminins and collagens were all increased in abundance in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Collagens are reported to alter the stiffness of the ECM and their synthesis is iron intensive.

Besides its role as a growth factor, TGFB1 has been shown to have important roles in the regulation of the immune response, promoting the generation of regulatory T cells, while inhibiting the generation and function of effector T cells.

A high proportion of these decreased abundance proteins affect nuclear processes. Thus, an overrepresentation analysis showed that proteins whose abundance was decreased in hiPSCs were enriched in GO terms related to DNA recombination, nucleosome positioning and chromatin silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Notably, this included four H1 histone variants, which are reported to influence nucleosomal repeat length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> and stabilise chromatin structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

The Andromeda search engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> assigns peptide intensities to a protein following a razor peptide approach, where the intensity of a peptide is assigned to only one protein, regardless of whether it is unique, or shared by two or more proteins. This makes the analysis of specific variants challenging at the protein level. Hence, we focussed on a peptide-specific approach with the MS data and found that the intensity of the peptides that were shared between these 3 H1 histone variants displayed a consistent reduction in abundance in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P31">The systematic reduction in abundance in hiPSCs seen with H1 histone variants was not seen for members of the other histone families. Evaluating either the concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), or copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>), across all histones, showed no significant differences in expression between hiPSCs and hESCs. Furthermore, for core histones, including H3 and H4, there were no significant abundance differences seen within either the proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g&amp;h</xref>), or in additional western blot analyses that were performed to validate these conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i&amp;j</xref>). However, we did detect differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the expression of histone H2 variants, with H2AFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6k</xref>), H2AFY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6l</xref>) and H2AFY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6m</xref>), all increased in abundance in hiPSCs.

Thus, we conclude that there are opposing effects for histone H1 and histone H2 variants, with the former decreased and the latter increased in abundance in hiPSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">Induced pluripotent stem cells can provide valuable models for clinical research and future therapies, which makes it vital to understand both their similarities and any specific differences, with embryo-derived human stem cells. This study provides a detailed comparison of the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from different donors. The major conclusion is that while hiPSC and hESC lines express a near identical set of proteins, with similar abundance ranks, they also display important quantitative differences. In particular, our data indicate that hiPSCs reprogrammed from skin fibroblasts display considerable differences in their cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteomes, compared to hESCs, while the nuclear proteome was very similar between the two cell types. Furthermore, additional microscopy analyses and functional assays showed that the systematic differences in the proteomes of the respective hiPSCs and hESCs had a measurable impact on cell phenotypes, most notably affecting mitochondria, metabolic activity, and nutrient transport. It would be of interest in future to analyse whether hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types, such as peripheral leukocytes, also share these differences in protein expression with hESCs, or if these specific changes are characteristic of fibroblast-derived iPS cells.</p><p id="P33">Using estimated protein copy numbers, our data show that only &lt;1% of proteins were significantly decreased in abundance in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs, including multiple H1 histones In contrast, ~ 56% of all proteins quantified were significantly increased in hiPSCs (fold change&gt;1.5 and q-value &lt;0.001), with most of these increases affecting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins and activities. The MS data show that total protein levels are higher overall in hiPSCs, as compared with hESCs, a result that was independently validated using an EZQ protein assay. This difference in total protein content was shown by FACS analysis not to result from systematic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in cell cycle progression. Instead, the increased protein levels in hiPSCs correlated with increased levels of the protein translational machinery, along with increased metabolic and mitochondrial activity and higher levels of nutrient transport.</p><p id="P34">These results highlight an important technical point relating to data normalisation and its effect on the interpretation of such data. By using a standard median normalisation (concentration-based approach), instead of the proteomic ruler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the difference in total protein content between the cell types, involving the increased abundance of thousands of proteins, is not apparent. Hence, two cell types with, for example, a 4-fold higher total protein content, could nonetheless appear to show virtually no significant differences, as long as the protein ranks and relative concentrations remained similar. This would result in an erroneous conclusion that there is little to no change in protein expression, while the orthogonal data suggest otherwise.</p><p id="P35">Having established that hiPSCs displayed higher total protein content than corresponding hESC lines, we sought to understand how this could be maintained. To maximise protein synthesis, nutrient availability and energy production are key factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The proteomic data show that vital nutrient transporters, known to be important for growth and protein production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> were significantly increased in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs. In particular, the 3 glutamine transporters, SLC1A5, SLC38A1 and SLC38A2, were all significantly increased in abundance, with additional functional assays showing that this correlated with higher levels of glutamine uptake measured in hiPSCs. Glutamine has been previously shown to fuel growth and proliferation in rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and could be sustaining higher rates in hiPSCs.</p><p id="P36">Nutrients provide the fuel, but it is the metabolic proteins that are the engines that convert them to energy. Here, our data showed that proteins involved in both glycolysis and glutaminolysis were significantly increased in abundance in hiPSCs. When cells preferentially use the glycolytic pathway, e.g., stem cells and cancer cells, there is increased demand for biosynthetic precursors and NADPH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These precursors can be supplied via glutaminolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> linked to the TCA, both important mitochondrial processes and both with significantly increased protein levels in hiPSCs, along with other proteins involved in the electron transport chain. One caveat is that an uneven distribution of biological sex between donors of the respective hESC and hiPSCs lines, could mean there is a potential for sex-specific differences to explain at least some of these effects, however in previous a large-scale proteomic study of male and female hiPSCs no changes in proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation were detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Differences in the mitochondria between hiPSCs and hESCs have been previously reported, but whether they originate from the reprogramming process, or are induced by the increased nutrient uptake, remains unknown and is a point of interest for future studies.</p><p id="P37">Secreted proteins, such as growth factors and ECM proteins, are a category of great interest, because their absolute abundance can affect the surrounding cellular microenvironment. hiPSCs were found here to show increased expression levels of growth factors that are linked to cancer and immunosuppression. For example FGF2, an important growth factor for primed pluripotent stem cells, has been shown that to promote ERK activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, stimulating protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, the increased abundance of FGF2 could generate a feedforward loop, further driving/sustaining growth in hiPSCs, however that growth potential is also linked to breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and gastric cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, as well as gliomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Another important growth factor that is increased in abundance in hiPSCs is TGFB1, a known potent inhibitor of T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. We note that the immunogenicity of pluripotent stem cells has important consequences for cell therapy applications. Our data suggest that hiPSCs might have a higher immune evasion potential, via multiple mechanisms. They display increased abundance of secreted T cell inhibitors, including TGFB1 and ARG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, along with inhibitory ligands, such as CD276, CD200 and CD47. An increased inhibitory capacity, combined with the tumorigenic potential of hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, raises some concerns about the suitability of using reprogrammed hiPSCs for certain types of therapeutic applications. Based upon our current data, we recommend that potential phenotypic consequences resulting from the observed differences in iPS and ESC proteomes should be studied further to determine whether the immunosuppressive properties of these cells vary significantly.</p><p id="P38">In summary, our data show that hiPSCs and hESCs, despite their clear similarities, are not identical at both the protein and phenotypic levels.

The analysis was performed in an oxygraphic chamber with thermostat set to 37¬∞C with continuous stirring (Oxygraph-2 k, Oroboros instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Cells were collected with trypsin, pelleted, and then placed in MiR05 respiration medium (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH at 30¬∞C, and 1 g/l BSA, essentially fatty acid free). Substrate-Uncoupler-Inhibitor titration protocol number 2 (SUIT-002)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> was used to determine respiratory rates. Briefly, after residual oxygen consumption in absence of endogenous fuel substrates (ROX, in presence of 2.5 mM ADP), was measured, fatty acid oxidation pathway state (F) was evaluated by adding malate (0.1 mM) and octanoyl carnitine (0.2 mM) (OctM<sub>P</sub>). Membrane integrity was tested by adding cytochrome c (10 ŒºM) (OctMc<sub>P</sub>). Subsequently, the NADH electron transfer-pathway state (FN) was studied by adding a high concentration of malate (2 mM, OctM<sub>P</sub>), pyruvate (5 mM, OctPM<sub>P</sub>), and glutamate (10 mM, OctPGM<sub>P</sub>). Then succinate (10 mM, OctPGMS<sub>P</sub>) was added to stimulate the S pathway (FNS), followed by glycerophosphate (10 mM, OctPGMSGp<sub>P</sub>) to reach convergent electron flow in the FNSGp-pathway to the Q-junction. Uncoupled respiration was next measured by performing a titration with CCCP (OctPGMSGp<sub>E</sub>), followed by inhibition of complex I (SGp<sub>E</sub>) with rotenone (0.5 ŒºM, SGp<sub>E</sub>). Finally, residual oxygen consumption (ROX) was measured by adding Antimycin A (2.5 ŒºM). ROX was then subtracted from all respiratory states, to obtain mitochondrial respiration. Results are expressed in pmol ¬∑ s<sup>-1</sup> ¬∑ 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells. The P/E control ratio, which reflects the control by coupling and limitation by the phosphorylation system, was subsequently calculated by dividing the OctPGMSGp<sub>P</sub> value by the OctPGMSGp<sub>E</sub> value.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Radiolabelled glutamine uptake (protocol was adapted from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>)</title><p id="P53">Two hiPSC lines (wibj_2 and oaqd_3) with 3 technical replicates each were compared to two hESC lines (SA121 and SA181) with 3 technical replicates of each.
