<p id="P1">Repeated emergence of highly contagious and potentially immune-evading variant SARS-CoV-2 is posing global health and socioeconomical threats. For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice <italic>in vitro</italic>. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets and aerosols that are derived from saliva of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic infected persons, although bronchial and laryngeal aerosols may also be involved in the viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Saliva containing the virus is scattered by speaking, coughing and sneezing from the oral cavity to environment and form the droplets and aerosols that could reach nasal and oral mucosa of nearby persons to cause infection. We considered that inactivation of virus in saliva may result in attenuation of viral spread among people, and explored various food ingredients that inactivate the SARS-CoV-2. We reported that tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea significantly reduced infectivity of conventional SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. We also found that (-) epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), a tea catechin contained in tea leaves and green tea at high concentrations, rapidly and powerfully inactivated the virus, while stronger effects were exerted by black tea ingredients, theaflavins (TFs) with (a) 3 and/or 3’ galloyl moiety(ies) (theaflavin-3-gallate (TF3G), theaflavin-3’-gallate (TF3’G), and theaflavin-3,3’-O-digallate (TFDG)) and theasinensin A (TSA) that are produced from catechins by enzymatic oxidization during manufacturing of black tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p>
<p id="P3">More recently, variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are highly contagious and may evade immunity have emerged and spread worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. But it has not been clarified whether tea ingredients also inactivate these variants.</p>
<p id="P4">Meanwhile, more than 70% of tea is manufactured into black tea that is consumed all over the world. People in some countries/areas consume larger amounts of black tea <italic>per capita</italic> than those in other countries/areas, but any epidemiological analysis have not demonstrated a significant negative correlation between black tea consumption and infected population. Black tea is often consumed with sugar, milk, lemon juice, honey, jam, cinnamon, etc. These ingredients could potentially influence the activity of black tea to block the virus infection.</p>
<p id="P5">In this study we examined whether black tea inactivated the variants of the SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also assessed whether an addition of sugar, milk, or lemon juice influenced the anti-virus effect of black tea.</p>

<title>Black Tea Inactivated Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Kappa Variants of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P6">Conventional and variants of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) were treated with black tea, and the titers of the viruses were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The alpha and gamma variants were as remarkably inactivated by black tea as conventional SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similar results were also obtained with delta and kappa variants (data not shown).</p>
<p id="P7">Effects of TF and its gallate esters on SARS-CoV-2 were examined. The black tea that we used in the experiments contains approximately 60 μM TF, 75 μM TF3G, 35 μM TF3’G, and 60 μM TFDG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. These concentrations of TFs were tested for the inhibitory activity against delta and kappa variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Another aliquot of virus was treated with a cocktail of these TFs. As shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d</xref>, non-galloylated TF at 60 μM failed to reduce the virus titers, whereas both viruses were remarkably inactivated by 75 μM TF3G. The virus titers more remarkably fell after treatment with 60 μM TFDG, and to a similar extent, with the cocktail of TFs. We previously compared effects of the same concentration of these four TFs, and found that TFDG most strongly inhibited conventional SARS-CoV-2, while TF3G and TF3’G showed lower activities, and any significant inhibitory effect was not exhibited by non-galloylated TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. TFDG also inactivated the alpha and gamma variants (data not shown). The present data on the delta and kappa variants are consistent with the previous findings on conventional virus, and TFDG most principally contributed to the anti-virus effect of black tea among the TFs tested.</p>

<title>Black Tea Inactivated the Delta Variant that Were Diluted in Human Saliva</title>
<p id="P8">To estimate the possibility that tea consumption by infected persons results in inactivation of the virus in saliva, the delta variant virus was diluted in saliva from four healthy donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>), and the mixture was treated with black tea at 1:1 (vol:vol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). After infection, viral RNA replication in the cells was evaluated by real time RT-PCR analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, viral RNA was significantly fewer in the cells infected with black tea-treated virus than in the cells infected with non-treated virus. We also quantified viral RNA in the culture supernatant to evaluate secondary virus released from the infected cells. It was revealed that the treatment of the virus with black tea resulted in a significantly lower degree of secondary virus production from the infected cells.</p>

<title>Milk Casein Prevented Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Black Tea</title>
<p id="P9">We supplemented black tea with sugar, milk and/or lemon juice at ratios comparable to ordinary beverages (6 g sugar, 40 mL milk, and 2 mL lemon juice per 160 mL of tea), and examined whether the supplementation influenced the ability of black tea to inactivate the alpha and delta variants diluted in human saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Although black tea significantly inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 variants, the anti-virus activity of the black tea was totally hampered by an addition of milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). Neither sugar nor lemon juice significantly affected the titers of the virus.</p>
<p id="P10">What is the active component in milk that inhibits the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of black tea? Some previous literatures reported that caseins form a complex with tea catechins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Because theaflavins with (a) gallate ester(s) are derived from, and share common structures with, catechins, we examined possible involvement of casein in the inhibitory activity of milk. We prepared a casein solution at a concentration of 2.7% (w/v) that is comparable to a standard concentration of casein in ordinary cow’s milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For an example, an addition of 25% (vol) of this casein solution to black tea (thus, 250 μL casein solution was added into 1 mL of tea) simulates an addition of 25 mL of milk to 100 mL of black tea, resulting in an approximate casein concentration of 0.54% (w/v). As results, casein dose-dependently prevented black tea from reducing the virus titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P11">In this study we demonstrated that black tea and its constituent galloylated TFs inactivate variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses including the delta variant <italic>in vitro</italic>. The inactivation effect was counteracted by an addition of milk casein into the black tea.</p>
<p id="P12">Bovine milk contains 32-37 g/L of proteins, and caseins account for about 80% of the whole milk proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Caseins consist of four polypeptides, i.e., alpha<sub>S1<sup>-</sup>
</sub>, alpha<sub>S2<sup>-</sup>
</sub>, beta<sub>-</sub> and kappa-caseins, and form large colloidal particles, the casein micelles, that are dispersed in milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Caseins are involved in transport of calcium and phosphorus. Previous reports demonstrated that caseins bound to catechins including EGCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], leading to a significant decrease in antioxidant activity of catechins and non-galloylated TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Addition of milk also blocked the vascular protection effect of black tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Our results suggest that galloylated TFs may also bind to caseins resulting in a loss of anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of black tea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Polyphenols including TFs are involved in flavor, bitter taste and astringency of tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Addition of milk reduces the bitterness and astringency of tea, probably due to the binding of caseins to catechins and TFs.</p>
<p id="P14">Tea drinkers add various amount of milk to their black tea infusions. In our study, additions of 6.25% and 3.31% (vol) of 2.7% casein solution into black tea totally blocked the inactivation effect against alpha and delta variants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b and c</xref>). This means that approximately 4 and 8 mL of milk completely block the anti-virus effect of a cup of tea (assuming its volume to be 125 mL) against delta and alpha variants, respectively. A smaller volume of milk partially reduced the anti-virus activities. But the relationship between the ratios of milk vs. tea infusions and degrees of counteraction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect may differ depending on the types of tea and milk.</p>
<p id="P15">The alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants of SARS-CoV-2 have N501Y, N501Y plus E484K, L452R, L452R plus E484Q mutations, respectively, in the viral Spike proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. These amino acid substitutions may be associated with the high contagiousness and/or immune escape of the variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. We previously showed that TFDG may bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The present data suggest that the amino acid substitutions in these variant viruses may not crucially affect the interaction between galloylated TFs to RBD.</p>
<p id="P16">The present findings that black tea inactivates SARS-CoV-2 only in the absence of milk may partly explain the reason why the infected population in a country/area is not negatively correlated with black tea consumption in the country/area. Various other factors including geographical, genetical, cultural, and social ones also influence the degree of virus spread among particular population.</p>
<p id="P17">Ingestion of tea at appropriate occasions may potentially attenuate viral spread to nearby persons, as we previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and black tea without milk may be applicable to this purpose. Besides, repetitive ingestion of milk-free black tea shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentially bring a beneficial effect on disease progression in infected persons, because viral amplification in the oral cavity at the earlies stages of infection may play important roles in subsequent viral infection in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Clinical studies are required to investigate these possibilities.</p>

<title>Black tea inactivated delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 diluted in human saliva.</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in saliva from four healthy donors (Numbers 1-4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) or in distilled water (DW) as a control, and treated with x1 black tea or DW as described in the Materials and Methods. One min later the mixture was added to the cells for 1 h, followed by replacement of the supernatant by fresh culture medium and subsequent culture for 8 h. RNA was extracted from the cells and the culture supernatants, and real time-RT-PCR was performed to evaluate viral N gene RNA levels. Scheme of experiments (a) and means ± S.D. of RNA levels (N = 3) (b and c) are shown. * p &lt; 0.05, between groups.</p>
