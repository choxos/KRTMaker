<abstract>
<p id="P1">Coronavirus disease 2019 is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Evidence on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating rapidly. In addition to structural proteins such as Spike and Envelope, the functional roles of non-structural and accessory proteins in regulating viral life cycle and host immune responses remain to be understood. Here, we show that open reading frame 8 (ORF8) acts as messenger for inter-cellular communication between alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanistically, ORF8 is a secretory protein that can be secreted by infected epithelial cells via both conventional and unconventional secretory pathways. The unconventionally secreted ORF8 recognizes the IL17RA receptor of macrophages and induces cytokine release. However, conventionally secreted ORF8 cannot bind to IL17RA due to N-linked glycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Yip1 interacting factor homolog B (YIF1B) is a channel protein that translocates unglycosylated ORF8 into vesicles for unconventional secretion. Blocking the unconventional secretion of ORF8 via a YIF1B knockout in hACE2 mice attenuates inflammation and yields delayed mortality following SARS-CoV-2 challenge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is continuing to spread around the world with nearly 256 million confirmed cases and more than 5.1 million deaths. According to clinical case reports, critically ill patients with COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms behind the cytokine storm and how SARS-CoV-2 affects cytokine release is still limited.</p>
<p id="P3">Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and it is one of the most rapidly evolving β-coronaviruses proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). A 29 nucleotide deletion in ORF8 is the most obvious genetic change in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS or SARS-CoV-1) during its host-jump from bats to humans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The Δ382 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which eliminates ORF8 transcription, seems to be associated with milder infection and less systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In a previous study, we demonstrated that ORF8 contributes to the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Specifically, we found ORF8 to interact with the IL17RA receptor, leading to excessive activation of IL-17 signaling and downstream NF-κB pathway. However, it remains unclear how the virus exposes ORF8 to enable access to the extracellular domain of IL17RA.</p>
<p id="P4">In eukaryotes, secretory proteins usually contain a signal peptide that triggers translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Following this translocation to the ER, cargoes will be exported through ER-Golgi trafficking for further processing and modification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This process is termed conventional secretion. Besides, many cytosolic proteins without signal peptides, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 and yeast Acb1, can be released through an unconventional protein secretion pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Recently, Zhang et al. identified TMED10 as a protein channel for vesicle entry and secretion of interleukin 1 family members(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Evidently, viral proteins can hijack this secretion pathway to become secreted. For example, the HIV-1 Nef protein can be released from infected cells via an exosomal pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, very little is known about whether and how SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins are secreted during infection.</p>
<p id="P5">Glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification, it involves the addition of glycans to macromolecules and is considered essential for the correct folding and functional performance of proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It is also not uncommon for proteins from pathogens to be glycosylated by the host. The co-evolution of N-linked glycosylation sites in influenza viruses affects the host specificity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The glycosylation of viral envelope proteins has a wide range of functions, including regulating cell tropism, protein stability and immune evasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has 22 N-linked glycosylation sites and 17 O-linked glycosylation sites, which may influence viral infectivity and pathogenicity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In contrast to the situation for the Spike protein, glycosylation and its functional role in accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported.</p>
<p id="P6">Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 as a secretory protein that can be secreted via conventional and unconventional secretory pathways at the same time. We found that unglycosylated ORF8 secreted via an unconventional pathway is responsible for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by binding the IL17RA receptor. By contrast, conventionally secreted ORF8 is incapable of binding to IL17RA due to the N-linked glycosylation at Asn78 site. Further, we identified Yip1 interacting factor homolog B (YIF1B) as a channel protein that recognizes and translocates unglycosylated ORF8 into vesicles, thus enabling unconventional secretion. Our findings present an important contribution to the understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 promotes the onset of cytokine storm, and provide a promising strategy for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a secretory protein that is associated with cytokine release</title>
<p id="P7">In order to investigate the secretion of ORF8 protein, we infected Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 that was generated using a reverse genetic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cell culture supernatant was collected and presence of ORF8 was determined by ELISA and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We found that ORF8 protein can be secreted into cell culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To further validate these results, we used the non-secretory SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase (M pro, also known as 3CL pro) non-secreted control, and the well-known Nef secretory protein of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) as a secreted protein control. We found that Jurkat cells secreted Nef protein following HIV-1 infection, and Calu-3 cells secreted ORF8 protein after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). By contrast, the structural protein 3CL pro was not secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we tested the time-dependency of ORF8 secretion in Calu-3 epithelial cells. After 12 hours of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell culture medium was replaced and ORF8 protein in the supernatant was detected every 2 hours. Using 3CL pro as a negative control, we found that the secretion of ORF8 continued for at least 12 hours after replacing the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a secretory protein.</p>
<p id="P8">Our previous study has shown that ORF8 protein contributes to the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells through binding to ACE2 receptors, however monocytes/macrophages play a critical role in the secretion and regulation of cytokines. Next, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 variant with an ORF8 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), and constructed an epithelial cell-macrophage co-culture system using a Transwell setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), to answer the question that whether ORF8 is a key factor in modulating the transmission process of infection signals from epithelial cells to monocytes/macrophages. In this system, the release of pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages infected with either wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or ORF8-deletion variant was increased, probably due to a small amount of ACE2 receptor expressed on the surface of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, H</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the amount of pro-inflammatory factors in the co-culture system was much higher than that measured in individual epithelial cells or macrophages infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). However, this synergistic pro-inflammatory effect between epithelial cells and macrophages was not observed in the ORF8-deletion virus infected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Considering that ACE2 is responsible for virus entry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), and IL17RA is the receptor of ORF8(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), we generated ACE2-deficient epithelial cells (Calu-3 <italic>Ace2</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup>) based on Calu-3 cell line, and IL17RA-deficient macrophages [THP-1-derived macrophages (THP-1 DM) <italic>Il17ra<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic>] based on THP-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). By using these two ways to disrupt cellular communication between epithelial cells and macrophages, preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry by ACE2 deletion in Calu-3 <italic>Ace2<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> cells, or interrupting ORF8 reception by IL17RA deletion in THP-1 DM <italic>Il17ra<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> cells, a significant downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors was observed in the co-culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). These results implied that inter-cellular communication between epithelial cells and monocytes/macrophages is important for the cytokine release during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P9">It is known that secretory proteins, such as Nef, can be secreted in absence of viral infection in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We therefore tested whether ORF8 protein can be secreted by human embryonic kidney (HEK-293FT) cells transfected with an ORF8-Flag plasmid. The results showed that Flag-tagged ORF8 was secreted in absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). Furthermore, the supernatant of cells transfected with ORF8-Flag was collected and added to the culture medium of THP-1 DM cells for stimulation. In this setup, the release of pro-inflammatory factors in THP-1 DM cells stimulated with ORF8-Flag transfection supernatant was significantly increased compared to cells treated with control supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a secretory protein, and that extracellular ORF8 protein is of greatly promoting cytokine release.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 has an unconventional secretory pathway</title>
<p id="P10">In order to understand the secretion pattern of ORF8, we used an online tool, Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de</ext-link>), to analyze structural domains of the ORF8 protein. We found a hydrophobic central domain (similar to the conserved signal peptide of eukaryotes) to be located at its N-terminus. We defined this domain as the signal peptide of ORF8 protein. Signal peptide-deficient mutant (ΔSignal-SARS-CoV-2 ORF8) was constructed and transfected into Calu-3 epithelial cells and HEK-293FT cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The result showed that the secretion ability of ORF8 was substantially impaired by signal peptide deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). Interestingly, an appreciable quantity of signal peptide-deficient ORF8 was observed in both the supernatant of Calu-3 and HEK-293FT cells. This result strongly suggested that the secretion of ORF8 is not completely blocked by the signal peptide deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). This data implied that secretion of ORF8 might not completely depend on the presence of the signal peptide.</p>
<p id="P11">Proteins secreted through the conventional secretory pathway contain an N-terminal signal peptide, which is recognized by the signal recognition particles and transported into the ER, followed by signal peptide cleavage and trafficking to the Golgi apparatus and the subsequent endomembrane system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). To verify the existence of an unconventional secretory pathway for ORF8, Brefeldin A(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) or Monensin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) was used to inhibit the Golgi-related vesicle transportation. Consistent with our previous result, secretion of ORF8 was still observed when the conventional secretory pathway was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">To understand whether the secretion pattern of ORF8 is evolutionary conserved, we analyzed the homologous ORF8 of SARS and found the SARS ORF8a isoform to contain an N-terminal signal peptide. We then constructed a ΔSignal-SARS ORF8a mutant and transfected it into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). While the intact SARS ORF8a was secreted normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), the ΔSignal-SARS ORF8a lost the secretory ability completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). This finding stands in interesting contrast to our results showing that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is secreted in absence of the signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). This finding was further supported by inhibition of the Golgi-related vesicle transport using Brefeldin A or Monensin in Calu-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>) and HEK-293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). The results obtained here show that SARS ORF8a can only be secreted under the guidance of signal peptide through the conventional secretory pathway.</p>
<p id="P13">Considering that the signal peptides of these two different ORF8 proteins share distinct sequences, we asked whether the different secretion patterns of ORF8 is due to the different types of signal peptide. To examine this hypothesis, we exchanged the ORF8 signal peptides between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). As a result, exchange of signal peptides did not change the secretory patterns observed for the two viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 carrying the SARS ORF8a signal peptide was still secreted when the Golgi-dependent secretory pathway was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is likely to have an unconventional secretion pattern that does not depend on the presence of a signal peptide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Unconventional secretion of ORF8 is required for cytokine storm</title>
<p id="P14">Next, we studied whether the different secretion patterns of ORF8 are associated with the release of pro-inflammatory factors. Calu-3 epithelial cells were pretreated with Brefeldin A or Monensin to block the conventional secretory pathway, then cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and culture supernatant was collected to stimulate THP-1 DM cells. After 12 hours, pro-inflammatory factors secreted by macrophages were examined by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, although the amount of secreted ORF8 was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), the release of pro-inflammatory factors was barely affected by Brefeldin A or Monensin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In order to rule out the possibility of mutual influence between macrophages themselves, we tested pro-inflammatory factors released by THP-1 DM cells stimulated with supernatant at different time intervals. The result showed that there were no significant differences in the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by macrophages within 0-12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Further, we used exogenously expressed Flag-tagged ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), instead of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to validate this finding. Consistent with previous results, we observed almost equal expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors induced by ORF8-Flag regardless of the Golgi-dependent secretory pathway blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2B</xref>). These results implied that the unconventionally, instead of the conventionally secreted ORF8 is responsible for the cytokines release.</p>
<p id="P15">The current data point to a potential possibility that ORF8 secreted via different pathways might undertake different responsibilities. Interestingly, in our western blots, a smear band shifted to a higher molecular mass compared to ORF8 was regularly observed, this smear however disappeared when the conventional secretory pathway was inhibited by signal peptide deletion or Golgi apparatus damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, D, E</xref>). Increasing the acrylamide concentration of the SDS-PAGE gel and prolonging the electrophoresis time, we were finally able to distinguish a second band of secreted SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). The Golgi apparatus is known to be the workshop for protein trafficking and processing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), the most common form of protein processing in Golgi apparatus is glycosylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). With this in mind, we asked whether ORF8 is glycosylated during the conventional secretory pathway, which might be responsible for the band shift. Using PNGase F or O-Glycosidase + α2-3, 6, 8, 9 Neuraminidase A, we tested the glycosylation status of ORF8 protein secreted from Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found that PNGase F treatment, which hydrolyzes most of the N-linked glycans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), was leading to the formation of a single ORF8 protein band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Digesting SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 with O-linked glycan hydrolase O-Glycosidase and α2-3, 6, 8, 9 Neuraminidase A did not change the type of bands compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). These data suggested that part of the secreted SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein was N-glycosylated, and that this is likely a result of conventional secretion through the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, SARS ORF8a did not respond to glycoside hydrolases at all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2C</xref>), which means that conventional pathway secreted SARS ORF8a is not glycosylated.</p>
<p id="P16">Next, we asked whether the glycosylation status of ORF8 is associated with the release of pro-inflammatory factors. Calu-3 epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and tunicamycin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) or PNGase F was used to oppose the N-linked glycosylation, respectively. Then purified ORF8 protein was added into the culture medium of THP-1 DM cells for stimulation. The results showed that macrophages stimulated with non-glycosylated ORF8 showed an elevated level of cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Furthermore, we used plasmid transfection instead of SARS-CoV-2 infection to validate this result. In line with previous results, a similar upregulation in cytokine release was observed in the tunicamycin and PNGase F treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). In contrast, the pro-inflammatory factor expression of Calu-3 cells transfected with SARS ORF8a-Flag plasmid did not change upon tunicamycin or PNGase F treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that glycosylation state of ORF8 is closely associated with the release of pro-inflammatory factors.</p>

<title>N-linked glycosylation at Asn78 impedes ORF8 binding to IL17RA</title>
<p id="P17">In order to determine the specific glycosylation site of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, we collected the supernatant of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 epithelial cells and performed high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for N-glycosylation site mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). According to the identification by MS, we found the Asparagine 78 (Asn78 or N78) of ORF8 protein to be glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We further investigated the glycosylation site by creating a SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the ORF8 N78Q mutation. Following infection with a SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-N78Q mutant, Calu-3 epithelial cells secreted a single form of unglycosylated ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This finding was also validated by transfection of exogenously expressed Flag-tagged N78Q ORF8 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Further, we treated THP-1 DM cells with supernatant enriched from Calu-3 cells infected with wild-type or the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-N78Q mutant, respectively. In this context, more pronounced cytokine release was observed in macrophages stimulated with the ORF8-N78Q mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This result was further validated by exogenous expression of wild-type ORF8 and N78Q mutants. Consistent with previous results, transfection of N78Q mutant led to the excessive expression of pro-inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). These data show that unglycosylated ORF8, instead of glycosylated ORF8, is involved in the inflammation response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P18">In our previous studies, we found that the interaction between ORF8 and host IL17RA contributes to the formation of a cytokine storm(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Here, we tested the effect of ORF8 glycosylation on the activation of the IL-17 pathway. We found that ORF8 protein secreted from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-N78Q variant or Flag-tagged ORF8-N78Q mutant, which could not be N-glycosylated at N78, exhibited stronger binding to the IL17RA receptor compared to a wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Further, the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and IL17RA was significantly increased when PNGase F was used to remove glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). However, ORF8-N78Q showed consistently strong binding to IL17RA regardless of PNGase F treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). We also tested the activation of NF-κB signaling downstream of the IL-17 pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Consistently, the activation of NF-κB signaling was positively correlated with the binding affinity between ORF8 and IL17RA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A, B</xref>). Data collected from plasmid transfection of Flag-tagged ORF8 mutant further validated this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3C</xref>). To further confirm that the N-linked glycosylated ORF8 was secreted via a conventional pathway, Brefeldin A or Monensin was used to pretreat Calu-3 epithelial cells to block conventional secretory transport. As a result, inhibition of Golgi-dependent vesicle transport decreased the interaction between ORF8 and IL17RA in N78Q groups, because less ORF8 was secreted when ER-Golgi trafficking was blocked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3D, E</xref>); however, this inhibition did not affect the interaction between ORF8 and IL17RA in control groups, mainly due to conventionally secreted ORF8 was glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I, J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3F, G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Further, we prepared N-glycosylated ORF8 protein (ORF8-N-Glyc) <italic>in vitro</italic> and stimulated THP-1 DM cells directly. The results showed that glycosylated ORF8 could not bind the IL17RA receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), and that secretion of pro-inflammatory factors was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data indicated that glycosylation-deficient ORF8 is capable of binding to IL17RA and subsequent activation of the IL-17 pathway, thus promoting the cytokine storm. In order to further verify the contribution of ORF8 glycosylation to cytokine release during SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we treated humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice with aerosols of synthetic ORF8 or ORF8-N-Glyc. Compared with control group, the survival time of mice exposed to ORF8-N-Glyc was significantly prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). We also observed very little inflammation in the lungs from mice treated with ORF8-N-Glyc, while the lung lesions in unglycosylated ORF8-exposed mice were much more severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Additionally, mice treated with ORF8-N-Glyc secreted decreased levels of cytokines and chemokines in lungs and livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that the N78 glycosylation of ORF8 participates in the regulation of inflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<title>YIF1B is essential for the unconventional secretion of ORF8</title>
<p id="P20">A substantial number of secreted eukaryotic proteins lacking classical signal peptides (called leaderless cargoes) are released through unconventional secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). It has been reported that channel proteins located on the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) might mediate translocation of leaderless cargoes into transport vesicles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). However, the driving factors of initial vesicle formation have not yet been fully elucidated. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy contributes to the formation of unconventional secretory vesicles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether the unconventional secretion of ORF8 is regulated by autophagy. Calu-3 epithelial cells were pretreated with Brefeldin A to block the conventional secretory pathway, and then infected with SARS-CoV-2. Under the stimulation of starvation or Rapamycin (an autophagy activator), the secretion of ORF8 increased significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4A</xref>). Autophagy inhibitor 3- Methyladenine (3-MA) or Wortmannin (Wtm) could counteract the starvation-induced ORF8 secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4B</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of autophagy-related genes, such as <italic>Atg5, Atg2a</italic> or <italic>Atg2b</italic>, also inhibited the release of ORF8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4C</xref>). Additionally, we observed co-localization of ORF8 and ERGIC-53, indicating the possibility of ORF8 translocation into ERGIC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4D</xref>). The proteinase K protection test also provided evidence of vesicle-mediated ORF8 transportation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4E</xref>). These data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 likely features an unconventional secretion pattern similar to eukaryotic leaderless cargoes.</p>
<p id="P21">To further determine the channel protein that guides the translocation of ORF8 into an unconventional secretion pattern, we performed mass spectrometry analysis to identify proteins that interact with unglycosylated ORF8. To enrich as many potential channel proteins on ORF8 transport vesicles as possible, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-tagged ORF8 was transfected into HEK-293FT cells pretreated with aminopterin and Brefeldin A/Monensin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4F</xref>). Of the 156 potential interacting proteins, seven channel proteins appeared to be related to cargo transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4G</xref>). We then screened the seven candidates using knockdown strategy by siRNAs, and found that YIF1B was associated with the unconventional secretion of ORF8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">Next, we verified the interaction between ORF8 and YIF1B by immunoprecipitation. Flag-tagged ORF8 was transfected into HEK-293FT cells and an interaction between ORF8 and YIF1B was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The co-localization of exogenously expressed HA-tagged YIF1B and Flag-tagged ORF8 was detected in HEK-293FT cells by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) and the Duolink proximity ligation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Further, endogenous YIF1B and virus-derived ORF8 were able to form a complex in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Then we generated YIF1B-deficient cells (YIF1B-KO) based on the Calu-3 cell line, and found that unconventional secretion of ORF8 disappeared in absence of YIF1B; however, exogenous supplementation of YIF1B by plasmid transfection rescued the secretion of ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E, F</xref>). Moreover, cytokine release assays further proved that YIF1B overexpression reconstituted the function of ORF8 protein in YIF1B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). Likewise, ORF8 secretion and cytokine release data collected from ORF8-Flag plasmid transfection further confirmed above findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H-J</xref>). These results indicated that the unconventional secretion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 requires host YIF1B.</p>

<title>The α4 helix of YIF1B recognizes the β8 sheet of ORF8 for interaction</title>
<p id="P24">The structural domain of ORF8 protein, which is eight β-pleated sheets consisted by 165 amino acid chain, has been reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). We constructed ORF8 Δβ1-Δβ8 deletion mutants, respectively. The results of co-immunoprecipitation showed that an ORF8 mutant lacking the β8 sheet could not bind to YIF1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similarly, we observed that β8 sheet-deleted ORF8 could not be secreted when the conventional secretion pathway was blocked by Brefeldin A pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C, D</xref>). Likewise, the cytokine release by THP-1 DM cells stimulated with supernatant proved that β8 sheet domain was closely associated with the unconventional secretory pathway of ORF8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">In order to understand how YIF1B mediates the recognition and secretion of leadless cargoes, we constructed deletion mutants of five α helixes located on the transmembrane domains of YIF1B according to the structural predication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q5BJH7">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q5BJH7</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that a α4 helix deletion impaired the interaction between YIF1B and ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref>). Next, we transfected exogenous YIF1B mutants into wild-type epithelial Calu-3 cells. We found that the unconventional secretion of ORF8 increased significantly in YIF1B mutants groups; this however was not observed in the Δα4 mutant group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H-J</xref>). Further, after transfection of YIF1B mutants into YIF1B-KO cells, the unconventional secretion of ORF8 was rescued by all YIF1B mutants, except the Δα4 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7K-M</xref>). These data implied that the unconventional secretion of ORF8 relies on the α4 helix of YIF1B and depends on its presence in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H-J</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Next, we asked whether YIF1B-guided unconventional secretion of leaderless ORF8 is driven by direct recognition of the β8 sheet. To answer this question, we constructed a 3CL pro mutant with a β8 sheet fused to the C-terminus. Interestingly, an interaction between 3CL pro-β8 fusion and YIF1B was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7N</xref>), and secreted 3CL pro could be collected from culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7O</xref>). Collectively, these evidences indicated that unconventional secretion of ORF8 is mediated by host YIF1B through recognition and interaction between the β8 sheet and α4 helix domain.</p>

<title>YIF1B directly promotes the translocation of ORF8</title>
<p id="P27">Since the interaction between ORF8 and YIF1B is important for the unconventional secretion pattern of ORF8, we first looked for intracellular co-localization of ORF8 and YIF1B during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunofluorescence results showed that full-length ORF8 and YIF1B did co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). However, neither an ORF8 β8 sheet-deleted mutant nor a YIF1B α4 helix-deficient mutant co-localized with their respective partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B, C</xref>). Next, a proteinase K protection test was performed to examine whether ORF8 transportation into vesicles relies on ORF8-YIF1B interaction.</p>
<p id="P28">Full-length ORF8-Flag or YIF1B truncations were transfected into YIF1B-KO cells as indicated, the membrane pellets were collected by centrifugation and treated with proteinase K or Triton X-100. The results showed that in YIF1B-deficient cells, ORF8 was not transported into vesicles, leading to its degradation by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>). On the contrary, ORF8 was able to resist the degradation by proteinase K when YIF1B truncation was counteracted by transfection of YIF1B plasmids, except in case of the Δα4 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">Furthermore, we constructed an <italic>in vitro</italic> ORF8 transport system as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In this system, synthesized ORF8 was mixed with assembled proteoliposomes, and HEK-293FT cell lysate without endomembrane was used as the reaction buffer to promote the transport of ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>). A proteinase K protection test showed that YIF1B mediated the transport of ORF8 into proteoliposomes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P30">We also established a GFP fluorescence complementation system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) to validate if ORF8 resides in the same vesicle that also harbors YIF1B.

When the amount of transfected ORF8 or YIF1B increased, an elevation in fluorescence intensity was observed, suggesting that the binding rate of ORF8-YIF1B complex increased in a concentration depended manner(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8H, I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">Collectively, these data clarified that YIF1B directly promotes the translocation of ORF8 into vesicles for unconventional secretion.</p>

<title>YIF1B regulates cytokine storm upon SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P32">YIF1B regulates the translocation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 into vesicles, and thereby promotes the unconventional secretion of unglycosylated ORF8 protein, which is required for the downstream IL-17 signaling activation and release of pro-inflammatory. To ascertain the biologic significance of our findings, we generated YIF1B-deficient (<italic>Yif1b<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic>) mice in a hACE2 background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A-C</xref>). After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the interaction between ORF8 and YIF1B disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>), and ORF8 secretion was significantly decreased in alveolar epithelial cells collected from these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). In line with our expectations, supplementation of exogenous YIF1B restored the secretion of ORF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Further, epithelial cells obtained from <italic>Yif1b</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice only secreted N-glycosylated ORF8, indicating a deficiency of the unconventional secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>). Consistently, ORF8 secreted from <italic>Yif1b<sup>-/-</sup>
</italic> epithelial cells neither bound the IL17RA receptor nor did it trigger the downstream NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D, E</xref>). These data again illustrated that the unconventional secretory pathway mediated by YIF1B allows ORF8 to escape host cell glycosylation, thus enabling activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway.</p>
<p id="P33">To further characterize the functional role of host YIF1B in the development of a cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection, <italic>Yif1b</italic>

These results emphasize both the functional role of YIF1B in the unconventional secretion of ORF8 and the mechanistic role of unconventional ORF8 protein secretion in the development of a cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P34">Overall, we found that after invading host epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can be secreted through both conventional and conventional secretory pathways. In the conventional secretory pathway, ORF8 is N-glycosylated during the ER-Golgi trafficking, consequently, extracellular ORF8 lost the ability to recognize the IL17RA receptor of macrophages, likely due to steric hindrances imposed by N-glycosylation at the Asn78 site. By contrast, ORF8 is recognized and then translocated into vesicles directly by host YIF1B in an unconventional secretory pathway. Without experiencing the conventional ER-Golgi trafficking, ORF8 protein does not become glycosylated. Hence, extracellular ORF8 can be distributed through body fluid circulation and to get in contact with macrophages, where unglycosylated ORF8 binds the IL17RA receptor and activates the IL17 pathway and downstream NF-κB signaling facilitating the onset of a cytokine storm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P35">Understanding the specific functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is pivotal for us to perceive the mechanisms which contribute to its high infectivity, fitness, and virulence. Numerous studies unravelling the differential functions of structural proteins have appeared recently(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). However, it is worth noting that non-structural and accessory proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 likewise play significant roles in the regulation of the viral life cycle and also affect the immune response of the host. For example, ORF3a has been reported to induce apoptosis and promote lysosomal exocytosis-mediated viral egress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), while ORF6 protein of SARS-CoV-2 hampers the induction of host interferon signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p>
<p id="P36">ORF8, a non-conserved accessory protein, is likely to be associated with the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. According to clinical reports, ORF8 is highly immunogenic, anti-ORF8 antibodies are formed in the early stage of infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) and a significant T-cell response to ORF8 is observed in recovered patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). It is further reported that an ORF8-deficient SARS-CoV-2 strain (Δ382) in Singapore displays a significant reduction in virulence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In a recent study, Zhang et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 interacts with MHC-I, a marker protein located on the cell surface, and activates the lysosomal degradation pathway, thus achieving escape from immune surveillance by decreasing the expression of MHC I(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). These data indicate the specific role of ORF8 in infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P37">Our previous work showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 could interact with the IL17RA receptor, thereby leading to IL-17 pathway activation and an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Considering that IL17RA is a transmembrane protein and ORF8 binds to the extracellular domain of IL17RA, as well as combining with the existing evidences, we proposed that ORF8 might be a secretory protein that is secreted into extracellular compartments. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein can be secreted by infected epithelial cells, which is supporting the role of ORF8 as a cellular messenger between alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in the occurrence and development of a cytokine storm. Interestingly, we discovered that ORF8 can be secreted through both a conventional and an unconventional secretory pathway, and that ORF8 secreted via different pathways has different mechanistic functions in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, conventionally secreted ORF8 is N-glycosylated and loses the ability of binding the IL17RA receptor.</p>
<p id="P38">Unconventionally secreted ORF8 is undergoing the conventional ER-Golgi trafficking pathway and consequently does not become glycosylated. Therefore, it is able to bind the IL17RA receptor and activate IL-17 signaling induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. The existence of this unique indirect cellular communication mechanism, instead of virion release, during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection can at least partly explain why viral loads in patients are not directly proportional to the severity of disease symptoms in COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p>
<p id="P39">In this study, we found that SARS ORF8a is also a secretory protein. Unlike SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, SARS ORF8a could only be secreted through the conventional secretory pathway. Notably, the conventionally secreted SARS ORF8a is not glycosylated and is able to induce the release of pro-inflammatory factors. These differences might be due to the fact that ORF8 is the only SARS-CoV-2 protein with as low as approximate 20% homology to SARS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). In this context, the very different secretory pattern and functional role of ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 can partly explain why the disease spectrum of COVID-19 is different from that of SARS. Based on our data, we propose a potential competition between host and guest regarding the ORF8 protein: Primitive SARS invades host cells and secretes ORF8 through the conventional ER-Golgi trafficking pathway. ORF8 is not glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus and can induce the release of pro-inflammatory factors. However, the host does not just surrender to viral infection. During the evolutionary process, the host blocks the induction of IL-17 signaling though ORF8 glycosylation to maintain homeostasis. However, life finds a way; an evolved coronavirus develops a new pathway to bypass the glycosylation modification and secrete unglycosylated ORF8 protein, thus regaining an advantageous position in this competition for the moment. Nevertheless, this storyline needs to be validated by further studies.</p>
<p id="P40">In the current work, we identified YIF1B, a five-transmembrane protein, as a key molecule that mediates transport of cargo into vesicles to facilitate the unconventional secretion pattern of ORF8. Knockout of YIF1B in epithelial cells prevents the unconventional secretion of ORF8, and exogenous supplementation of YIF1B rescues the secretion of ORF8 even when Golgi apparatus is destructed by Brefeldin A. The <italic>in vitro</italic> translocation assay proved that YIF1B promotes the translocation of ORF8 into vesicles directly. Generally, the translocation process of leaderless cargoes into vesicles depends on chaperones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). For example, leaderless cargoes bind to chaperone HSP90A that likely recognizes and unfolds the cargoes in the TMED10-channeled unconventional protein secretion pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Whether the translocation of leaderless ORF8 into vesicles needs chaperones in addition to the YIF1B channel is not yet known. Notably, the proteinase K protection assays shows that ORF8 cannot be translocated into vesicles without the supplementation of cell lysates containing non-inner membranes. This result does suggest the necessity of chaperones in the translocation of leaderless ORF8. It would be interesting to further investigate the specific role of chaperones in the unconventional secretion of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8.</p>

<title>N-linked glycosylation identification by HPLC-MS/MS</title>
<p id="P48">N-linked glycosylation identification of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein was performed as previously described with slight modifications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Firstly, Calu-3 epithelial cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with/without Brefeldin A or Monensin pretreatment. The supernatant was collected and concentrated through a 10 kDa Amicon-Ultra centrifugal tube (Millipore). Then, the N-glycopeptides were enriched with Zic-HILIC (Fresh Bioscience), eluted and dried for deglycosylation. Enriched N-glycopeptides were digested using PNGase F dissolved in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> for 2 hours at 37 °C to remove N-linked glycosylation. Finally, deglycosylated peptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA for tandem mass spectrum analysis. MS1 was analyzed at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 using a scan range (m/z) of 800 to 2000 (N-glycopeptides before and after enrichment), or 350 to 1550 (deglycosylated peptides). The RF lens, AGC target, maximum injection time, and exclusion duration were 30%, 2.0 e<sup>4</sup>, 100 ms and 15 s, respectively. MS2 was analyzed with an isolation window (m/z) of 2 at an Orbitrap resolution of 15,000. The AGC target, maximum injection time, and the HCD type were standard, 250 ms, and 30%, respectively.</p>

<sec id="S21">
<title>Deglycosylation assays</title>
<p id="P49">Tunicamycin (12819, Cell Signaling Technology, 2μg/mL) was added into epithelial cells to prevent N-linked glycosylation. PNGase F (P0704, NEB, 1,000 units/μg protein) was used to remove the N-linked glycosylation in purified ORF8 protein. 1 μg glycoprotein, 2 μL GlycoBuffer 2 (10×), 2 μL PNGase F and H<sub>2</sub>O were mixed to form a 20 μL mixture. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 8 hours, followed by western blotting analysis. To remove O-linked glycosylation, purified proteins were directly digested by O-glycosidase (P0733, NEB, 4,000 units/μg protein) and α2-3, 6, 8, 9 Neuraminidase A (P0722, NEB, 4 units/μg protein). 10 μg glycoprotein, 1 μL 10× Glycoprotein Denaturing Buffer and H<sub>2</sub>O were combined to make a 10 μL mixture. The glycoprotein was denatured by heating the mixture at 100°C for 10 min. Then, 2 μL 10× GlycoBuffer 2, 2 μL 10% NP40, 2 μL α2-3, 6, 8, 9 Neuraminidase A, 1 μL O-Glycosidase and H<sub>2</sub>O were mixed to form a total volume of 20 μL and incubated at 37°C for 4 hours, followed by western blotting analysis.</p>

<title>Duolink PLA assay</title>
<p id="P52">Duolink PLA assay was performed according to the kit manual (Duolink In Situ Detection Reagents Red, DUO92008, Sigma). In brief, Flag-tagged ORF8 and HA-tagged YIF1B were co-transfected into HEK-293FT cells. After 12 hours, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100.

<p id="P53">Purified YIF1B proteins (NCBI accession number: NP_001034761.1) was synthesized by MembraneMax™ cell-free protein synthesis system according to the manufacturers’ protocol (A10633, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified ORF8 protein was expressed in baculovirus expression vector system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, ORF8 protein-coding sequence without signal peptide was optimized according to the insect cell codon preference, and synthesized by Sangon Biotech. The Asparagine 78 was mutated to Glutarnine to prevent glycosylation. Then, synthesized ORF8 sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted into a pFastBac HT A plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Recombinant pFastBac-ORF8 plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac-competent cells to obtain Bacmid-ORF8, which was transfected into Sf9 cells to produce ORF8 protein. Total lipids were extracted from HEK-293FT cells as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Purified YIF1B and lipids were reconstituted into proteolioposomes. To be specific, lipids were repeatedly frozen and thawed in a 42°C water bath for 10 times. Triton X-100 was used to dilute lipids to a final concentration of 0.05%, and the lipid solution was rotated at 4°C for 30 min. Then, the purified YIF1B protein was added into the lipid solution and rotated for 1 hour, followed by incubation with Biobeads SM2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) to absorb the detergent. After centrifugation to remove the beads, a membrane flotation procedure was performed to collect top fractions containing proteolioposomes. Next, proteolioposomes were mixed with ORF8 protein in HEK-293FT lysates (whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min and the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000×g for 40 min to remove endomembrane) for 1 hour. The mixture was centrifuged, aliquoted into three parts, and collected for proteinase K protection test.</p>

Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed in HB1 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 400 mM sucrose, and 1 mM EDTA) with 0.3 mM DTT and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000×g for 40 min to collect the total membrane pellet, followed by membrane flotation assay. The membrane fraction floating on the top was collected and divided into three parts (without proteinase K, with proteinase K, or with proteinase K and 0.5% Triton X-100). The reactions were performed on ice and stopped by adding PMSF and SDS loading buffer. The samples were immediately heated at 98°C for 5 min, followed by SDS-PAGE. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and a vesicle trafficking protein, SEC22 Homolog B (SEC22B), were used as the positive and negative control, respectively.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can be secreted by epithelial cells</title>
<p>(A) Schematic diagram of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cDNA clone generated by a reverse genetic system. The cDNA fragments F1-F7 were synthesized and assembled into full-length SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, and RNA transcription, electroporation, and virus production were carried out in Vero E6 cells.</p>
<p>(B) Schematic diagram of SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Calu-3 epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 12 hours at a dosage of 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. Cell culture supernatant was centrifuged and divided into two parts for western blotting and ELISA, respectively.</p>
