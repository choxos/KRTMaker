In-plane membrane tension and cortical tension both influence many cellular processes, including cell migration, division, and endocytosis. However, while actomyosin tension is regulated by substrate stiffness, how membrane tension responds to mechanical substrate properties is currently poorly understood. Here, we probed the effective membrane tension of neurons and fibroblasts cultured on glass and polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffness using optical tweezers. In contrast to actomyosin-based traction forces, both peak forces and steady state tether forces of cells cultured on hydrogels were independent of substrate stiffness and did not change after blocking myosin II activity using blebbistatin, indicating that tether and traction forces are not directly linked. Peak forces in fibroblasts on hydrogels were about twice as high as those in neurons, indicating stronger membrane-cortex adhesion in fibroblasts. Steady state tether forces were generally higher in cells cultured on hydrogels than on glass, which we explain by a mechanical model. Our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of effective membrane tension and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the biological processes it instructs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The cell membrane is supported by the underlying actomyosin cortex, and molecular linkers form tight connections between the two layers. Osmotic pressure resulting from ion gradients across the membrane and interactions of the membrane with the force-generating actomyosin cytoskeleton contribute to a tension across the membrane. This membrane tension regulates many cellular processes, such as cell migration, division, stem cell fate choice, and endo- and exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Despite its biological importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, membrane tension is still difficult to quantify. In-plane membrane tension is defined as the force per unit length acting tangentially on the plasma membrane. Because of the membrane’s coupling to cytoskeletal elements, measurements of the ‘effective’ membrane tension usually contain contributions of the underlying actomyosin cortex and other force-generating elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The actomyosin cortex is coupled to the extracellular environment through transmembrane proteins such as integrins and cadherins, which transmit tensile forces generated by acto-myosin interaction to the environment. The resulting traction forces, and hence cytoskeletal tension, increase with substrate stiffness for most cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that the measured effective membrane tension should also increase on stiffer substrates. However, the regulation of membrane tension by substrate mechanics is yet to be probed experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">Here, we used optical tweezers (OT) to probe membrane properties of cells cultured on polyacrylamide substrates of different stiffnesses as well as on glass. Using a membrane-adherent bead held in an optical trap, we pulled membrane tethers from cells, and the resulting tether forces served as an indicator for effective membrane tension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, Video S1). Throughout a pull, the force on the tether can be continuously monitored, resulting in a characteristic force-time curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The force rises quickly after initiation of the pull and reaches a peak before decreasing sharply. In agreement with Sheetz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we attribute this peak force (PF) to the initial local detachment of plasma membrane from the actomyosin cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), although it may also be influenced by measurement parameters such as the adhesion area between the bead and the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Subsequently, the tether is pulled until it reaches a set length. During this elongation process, the plasma membrane slides over the actin cortex while bonds between the membrane and the lipid-binding proteins located in or at the cortex are broken and quickly re-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. At the same time, membrane proteins may accumulate at the base of the tether and influence the pulling force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Overall, the measured forces then decrease during the elongation phase. Afterwards, the bead is held in a stable position and the steady-state force (SSF) is measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The SSF is thought to reflect a combination of the in-plane plasma membrane tension and the cortical tension, with the strength of the membrane-cortex adhesion determining the coupling between these two elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. As such, the SSF depends in a non-linear manner on the number of cortex-plasma membrane linkers such a ERM proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To test the effect of substrate mechanics and cortical tension on effective membrane tension, we performed tether pulls in fibroblasts, which possess a dense actomyosin cortex, and in neuronal axons, whose sub-membranous cytoskeleton is characterized by actin rings spaced by spectrin tetramers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Cells were cultured on glass as well as on hydrogels fabricated within a stiffness range adjusted to match their natural environment. For fibroblasts, hydrogel stiffnesses ranged from 100Pa (very soft; similar to subcutaneous adipose tissue), to 10kPa (stiff; already in the stiffness range of many fibrotic tissues)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. For neurons, the highest substrate stiffness used was 1kPa, corresponding to the highest stiffness experienced by this type of neuron <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Peak forces (PFs) measured in fibroblasts were about twice as high as those measured in neuronal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, f</xref>). Within each cell type, PFs were similar across all tested hydrogel substrates. Steady state forces (SSFs), which were comparable between fibroblasts and neurons, were also similar across all polyacrylamide substrate stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, g</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In contrast, actomyosin-based traction forces, i.e., contractile cellular forces exerted on the substrate, are known to scale with substrate stiffnesses for both neurons and fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We measured these forces in our culture conditions using traction force microscopy (TFM), where cells are cultured on soft, elastic hydrogels with embedded fluorescent nanoparticles (see Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

These data indicated that traction forces and net forces assessed by 2D traction force microscopy and tether forces measured by OT are not tightly coupled.</p><p id="P11">In order to further examine the interplay between cortical tension and effective membrane tension, we measured tether forces in fibroblasts cultured on 10 kPa hydrogels, where we would expect the highest cytoskeletal tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, following treatment with the myosin II (and thus contractility) inhibitor blebbistatin. Blebbistatin treatment had no significant effect on either PFs or SSFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that there is indeed no strong coupling between actomyosin-based cortical tension and average effective membrane tension in cells cultured on hydrogels.</p><p id="P12">As numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies use glass-bottomed culture dishes, and the surface properties of glass differ considerably from those of hydrogels, we also cultured fibroblasts and neurons on glass to test whether effective membrane tension is comparable in both culture environments.</p><p id="P13">In neurons, PFs measured in axons cultured on glass were indeed like those observed on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). However, PFs for fibroblasts cultured on glass were significantly lower than those for fibroblasts grown on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Similarly, SSFs were significantly lower for fibroblasts and neurons cultured on glass compared to those cultured on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, g</xref>).

In contrast, actomyosin-based traction and net forces increased on stiffer substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, h</xref>), as shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, suggesting that the effective membrane tension measured by OT dorsolaterally to adhesion sites is not directly linked to cellular contractility on hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In line with this interpretation, the application of the myosin II blocker, blebbistatin, did not alter the effective membrane tension of fibroblasts cultured on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Alternatively, membrane tension might be influenced by cortical tension on short time scales but is then actively regulated to resume original values quickly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that traction forces and membrane tension are coupled also on longer time scales but traction forces transmitted from focal adhesions and ventral stress fibres to the actin cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> dissipate with increasing distance from the stress fibres. Thus, on hydrogels enhanced cortical tension might be limited to ventral areas of the cell surface not accessible by OT. This would be in line with a recent study suggesting that cortical tension in dorsolateral parts of the cell are largely independent of traction forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">If cortical and membrane tension are coupled, membrane tension would then only change locally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> near focal adhesions and stress fibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which would not be seen when probed further away. Such local membrane tension heterogeneities would explain, for example, why the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1, which is thought to be activated by membrane tension, is activated only near focal adhesion sites despite being distributed across the whole cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">The effective membrane tension was higher in cells cultured on hydrogels than in those cultured on glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Fibroblasts developed much stronger stress fibres on glass than on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, indicating considerably larger traction forces. The strong contraction of stress fibres and the embedding actin cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> on glass could propagate further within the actin cortex than on hydrogels. The concomitant decrease in cortex area could cause the membrane to relax also in areas assessed by OT in cells cultured on glass, as schematically indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, explaining why tether forces were lower on glass than on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">This could not only explain why SSFs in fibroblasts were lower on glass than on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) but also why blebbistatin treatment, which relaxes both stress fibres, led to a significant increase in SSFs on glass but not on hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c-d</xref>). The tension exerted by growth cones on the distal axon, which increased on stiffer substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>), could similarly lead to membrane relaxation in neurons cultured on glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Alternatively, or additionally, differences in physical and chemical properties between glass and hydrogels could also activate different signalling pathways involved in the regulation of membrane tension homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">The PF, which is the initial force required to detach the membrane from the cortex, is related to membrane-cortex adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (in analogy to attempting to open Velcro from the middle). Fibroblasts have a dense actomyosin cortex, and proteins such as ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM proteins) can link the membrane to the cortex across the cell surface. Neuronal axons, on the other hand, have a periodic actin-spectrin network underneath their membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and much less area for ERM proteins to connect the membrane to actin rings. This morphological difference may lead to lower membrane-cortex adhesion in axons compared to fibroblasts, explaining why PFs are about twice as high in fibroblasts compared to axons cultured on physiologically stiff hydrogels. A low membrane-cortex coupling could also explain why tethers pulled from axons can freely “slide” along the axon as observed in a previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and the current study (video S2). To our knowledge, tether sliding has not been reported in fibroblasts.</p><p id="P21">Our results confirm that membrane tension measurements need to be interpreted carefully. Effective membrane tension dorsolaterally of adhesion sites did not depend on substrate stiffness within a physiological stiffness range, yet it varied between hydrogels and glass, and between cell types.

For Xenopus experiments, Xenopus medium was exchanged with RT imaging medium ~15 minutes prior to imaging.</p><p id="P38">In each OT experiment, 2 μl functionalised beads (see above) were added to the culture media and a bead captured in the trap. To reduce variations in the contact area between bead and cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, all relevant measurement parameters were tightly controlled. Beads of one size (2.16 μm) were used, ConA coated beads were prepared freshly for each experiment under temperature-controlled conditions, and the beads were attached by bringing them into contact with the cells for the same amount of time (5 seconds, see below).</p><p id="P39">During the entire process, the position of the bead relative to the laser trap was recorded in order to measure the force produced by the tether pull. Before attaching the bead to the cell, a short recording of the Brownian motion of the trapped bead was taken. The mean force from each recording was used to define the point of zero force in the subsequent analysis of each respective pull. Afterwards, the bead was carefully brought into contact with the cell membrane. The image of the bead was monitored for a change in the interference pattern around the bead, indicating contact between the bead and membrane. At this point the beads was held stationary for 5 s. Then it was moved approximately 0.25 μm away from the cell while monitoring the particle tracking system to see if the mean displacement of the bead from the trap centre was reduced, which signified that the bead was attached to the membrane.</p><p id="P40">Beads were then moved away from the cell at 0.1 μm s<sup>-1</sup> in the case of 3T3 fibroblasts and 0.5 μm s<sup>-1</sup> in the case of neurons, leading to the formation of a membrane tether between the cell and the bead. After reaching the end of the pull, 10 μm for 3T3 fibroblasts and 20 μm for neurons, the bead was held stationary for 30 s. The protocol for pulling tethers from neurons was based on previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Due to high rate of tether loss during preliminary pulls with fibroblasts, to the pulling velocity was reduced, leading to a subsequent decrease in the pull distance to avoid reducing experimental throughput. Pontes et al. showed that varying the velocities for tether pulls in 3T3 fibroblasts within the range of 0.07 μm/s to 1μm/s, did not affect the force results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore do not expect this velocity change to affect our observations. For each pull, the peak force was defined as the maximum force value reached, and the steady state force was determined as the mean of the 30 s period at the end of the pull during which the bead was held stationary. Analysis was performed using custom analysis scripts written in python 3.6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Hydrogels for fibroblasts</title><p id="P41">Deformable hydroxy-polyacryamide substrates for fibroblast cultures were prepared as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Briefly, for each gel a top coverslip and a glass-bottomed culture dishe (MatTek P35G-0.20-C and Ibidi 81158 were used for OT and TFM, respectively) were prepared. Both coverslips were first washed in 70% ethanol and distilled water, and then dried. Bottom coverslips were wiped with a cotton bud soaked in 1M NaOH, dried, and then incubated in (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS, Sigma Aldrich, 281778) for 3 min. APTMS was washed off thoroughly in ddH20 and coverslips were then incubated in a 0.5% solution of glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, G6257) for 30 min and then rinsed 3x with distilled water. Top coverslips were treated for 10 min with Rain-X (Shell Car Care International). Acrylamide (AA, Sigma Aldrich, A4058) stock solution was made by mixing 500 μL of 40% Acrylamide + 65 μL of 100% Hydroxyacrylamide (Sigma Aldrich, 697931).
