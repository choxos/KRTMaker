<abstract>
<p id="P1">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans, has a broad host range, and is able to infect domestic and wild animal species. Notably, white-tailed deer (WTD, <italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>), the most widely distributed cervid species in the Americas, were shown to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in challenge studies and reported natural infection rates approaching 40% in free-ranging WTD in the U.S. Thus, understanding the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD is critical to prevent future zoonotic transmission to humans and for implementation of effective disease control measures. Here, we demonstrated that following intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, WTD fawns shed infectious virus up to day 5 postinoculation (pi), with high viral loads shed in nasal and oral secretions. This resulted in efficient deer-to-deer transmission on day 3 pi. Consistent a with lack of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding after day 5 pi, no transmission was observed to contact animals added on days 6 and 9 pi. We have also investigated the tropism and sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication in adult WTD. Infectious virus was recovered from respiratory-, lymphoid-, and central nervous system tissues, indicating broad tissue tropism and multiple sites of virus replication. The study provides important insights on the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD, a wild animal species that is highly susceptible to infection and with the potential to become a reservoir for the virus in the field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has incurred over 260 million human cases and more than 5.2 million deaths around the world (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, single stranded RNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus, within the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, of the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Genome sequence analysis determined that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other sarbecoviruses identified in horseshoe bats in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Thus, this animal species is currently considered the most likely source of the ancestral virus from which SARS-CoV-2 originated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, given the genetic differences between SARS-like bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, it has been proposed that another, as yet unidentified, animal species may have played a role as an intermediate host prior to zoonotic spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="P3">Infection with SARS-CoV-2 involves binding of the viral spike (S) protein to its host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Comparison of the human ACE2 protein demonstrated a high degree of homology between the human ACE2 protein and its orthologues in multiple animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Among the species that the ACE2 protein shares a high degree of homology with human ACE2, are three species of deer, including Père David’s deer (<italic>Elaphurus davidianus</italic>), reindeer (<italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic>), and white-tailed deer - WTD (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>), suggesting potential susceptibility of these species to the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Notably, a pioneer study by our group demonstrated that WTD are indeed highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and shed high viral titers in the respiratory secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The relevance of our findings demonstrating the susceptibility of WTD to SARS-CoV-2 has been recently highlighted by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in wild WTD sampled in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, and Texas which showed a seroprevalence of ~40% in the sampled populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, two independent studies in Iowa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and Ohio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tissues and respiratory secretions collected from WTD, suggesting actual infections in free-ranging WTD. The high susceptibility of the species combined with the prevalence observed in free-ranging herds raise concerns about the possibility of WTD becoming a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. Although current evidence suggests circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in wild WTD, several questions remain unanswered regarding the potential role of this species as a reservoir for the virus, including whether sustained transmission that would allow maintenance of the virus in the field occurs in free ranging WTD populations.</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we expanded on our original work demonstrating the susceptibility of WTD to SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the transmission dynamics of the virus between contact animals over time and assessed the viral evolution as it replicated and transmitted between WTD. Additionally, we dissected the patterns of virus shedding, tissue tropism, and identified the main sites of viral replication during infection.</p>

<title>Subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection in WTD results in high viral shedding in respiratory and oral secretions</title>
<p id="P5">We have recently shown that WTD are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In this study, we assessed replication, shedding patterns and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD. For this, fifteen 8-month-old fawns (n = 15) were maintained in a biosafety level 3 (Agriculture) (BSL-3Ag) facility at the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) and randomly allocated to six experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Three fawns (n = 3) were maintained in room A as a control group (uninoculated), while six fawns (n = 6) were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (human isolate NYI67-20, 5 x 10<sup>6.38</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>.ml<sup>−1</sup>) and maintained in a separate room (room B or C) during the 22-day experimental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Six contact animals were allocated to three experimental groups that were maintained in pairs (n = 2) in separate rooms (rooms D, E and F). The contact and inoculated animals were moved into a clean room (room G or H) at three different time points post-inoculation (pi) (days 3 [n = 2], 6 [n = 2], and 9 [n = 2] pi), maintained in contact with the inoculated fawns for 48 h and were then moved back to their respective rooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). All fawns in the study (controls and inoculated animals) were monitored daily for clinical signs and body temperature. No clinical signs were observed in any of the animals during the experimental period. A slight and transient increase in body temperature was noted in 5 out of 6 inoculated fawns on day 1 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), and in 1 out of 6 inoculated fawns on day 2 pi. Throughout the rest of the daily monitoring period (11 days pi) the body temperatures remained within normal physiological range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">To monitor the infection and replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD, virus shedding was assessed following inoculation. Nasal and oral secretions and feces were collected using nasal (NS), oral (OS) and rectal swabs (RS) on days 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 22 pi, from inoculated and control fawns. The samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR), and by virus isolation and titrations. All control fawns (uninoculated) remained negative through the experimental period. Viral RNA was detected between days 2 and 22 pi in nasal and oral secretions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) in the inoculated animals, with higher viral RNA loads detected between days 2 and 7 pi and decreasing thereafter through day 22 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Shedding of viral RNA in feces were markedly lower compared to respiratory and oral secretions and was characterized by intermittent detection of low amounts of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). The dynamics and duration of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding was also assessed in nasal and oral secretions and in feces. While no infectious virus was recovered from feces, high viral loads were detected in nasal and oral secretions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). All inoculated animals shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 between days 2-5 pi, with viral titers ranging from 2.0 to 5.3 and 2.0 to 3.8 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.ml<sup>−1</sup>, in nasal and oral samples, respectively. No infectious SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from samples collected after day 6 pi from any of the inoculated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between WTD occurs shortly after infection</title>
<p id="P7">The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 between WTD was assessed by adding contact animals on days 3, 6 and 9 pi. SARS-CoV-2 transmission was only observed in fawns added on day 3 pi, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and infectious virus in oronasal secretions from contact animals on days 2 and 3 pc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A and B</xref>). Whereas contact animals added on days 6 and 9 pc did not become infected as evidence by the lack of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A and B</xref>). Notably, the two contact fawns added on day 3 pi shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in oronasal samples on days 2 and 3 pc with titers ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.ml<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Together these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 productively infected and could be detected in the upper respiratory tract of contact fawns.</p>
<p id="P8">Successful transmission and infection of SARS-CoV-2 to day 3 contact fawns was also confirmed by rRT-PCR performed in tissues including nasal turbinate, palatine tonsil, and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes collected from these animals on day 21 pc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Importantly, viral RNA loads in these tissues were comparable to those observed in inoculated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). All tissues collected from contact animals added on days 6 and 9 of the experiment tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Additionally, serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 (assessed by virus neutralization [VN] assay on day 21 pc) confirmed infection of day 3 contact animals. The two fawns added on day 3 seroconverted by day 21 pc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>), presenting neutralizing titers comparable to those observed in inoculated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). Contact fawns added on days 6 and 9 pi, and all the controls animals, remained seronegative throughout the experiment.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Low genetic diversity observed following SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission in WTD</title>
<p id="P9">To investigate potential changes in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 following replication in WTD, genome sequence analysis was performed after infection and transmission to contact animals. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained directly from nasal secretions from all the 6 inoculated fawns collected on days 3, 5, 7 and/or 9 pi and from oronasal secretions from the day 3 contact animals (n = 2) collected on days 2 and 3 pc. Whole genome sequence analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequences recovered from all inoculated and contact fawns revealed no amino acid differences in the consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome in comparison to the genome sequence of the inoculum virus, a human SARS-CoV-2 isolate NYI67-20 of the B1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Only minor variant viral populations with frequencies below 40% were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Only four of these changes resulted in amino acid changes with one leading to truncation of ORF7 (Table S1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in adult WTD is similar to that observed in WTD fawns</title>
<p id="P10">To gain insights into the sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication during acute infection, we conducted a second study in adult WTD. For this, eight deer (3-4 years of age; n = 8) were used and kept in the BSL-3Ag facility at the NADC. Two animals were maintained as controls (uninoculated) in room A, while six animals were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (human isolate NYI67-20, 5 x 10<sup>6.38</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>.ml<sup>−1</sup> − same virus stock used in the transmission dynamics study) and housed in a separate room (room B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Following inoculation, all animals were monitored daily for clinical signs and body temperature was recorded daily until the day of euthanasia of each animal. No clinical signs were observed in any of the animals during the experimental period. Similar to inoculated fawns, a slight and transient increase in body temperature was noted in 4 of 6 inoculated deer on day 1 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). To assess viral tissue distribution and sites of virus replication, two inoculated deer were euthanized on day 2 and two on day 5 pi. The other two inoculated animals and two controls were euthanized on day 20 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Viral RNA was detected until day 20 pi, or until the day of euthanasia (day 2 or 5 pi) in nasal secretions, and only sporadically in feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C-E</xref>). Similar to results obtained in fawns inoculated, high viral loads were detected in nasal secretions with titers ranging from 1.8 to 6.3 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.ml<sup>−1</sup> in the early phase of infection (day 2 to 6 pi), while no infectious virus was detected in feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5F-H</xref>). These results demonstrate similar clinical outcome, infection dynamics and shedding patters of SARS-CoV-2 in fawns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A and B</xref>) and adult deer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B-H</xref>).</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 presents a broad tissue tropism and replication sites during acute infection in WTD</title>
<p id="P11">To assess SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism and replication sites, twenty-four tissues were collected and processed for rRT-PCR and infectious virus quantification. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was consistently detected in 17 out of 24 tissues sampled from both deer euthanized on day 2 pi, with the highest viral RNA loads detected in the nasal turbinate and palatine tonsil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly, from the tissues collected on day 5 pi, several tested positive by rRT-PCR, confirming a broad tissue distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As observed on day 2 pi, nasal turbinate and palatine tonsil were the tissues in which the highest viral RNA loads were detected on day 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). By day 20 pi, viral RNA loads decreased when compared to early times pi, and viral RNA was more consistently detected in lymphoid tissues such as palatine and pharyngeal tonsil, as well as medial retropharyngeal- and mandibular lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). All tissues from the controls animals (uninoculated) tested negative by rRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Replication of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in rRT-PCR positive tissues by viral titrations. Notably, infectious virus was consistently detected in a broad range of tissues on days 2 and 5 pi including nasal turbinate, tonsil (palatine and pharyngeal), lymph nodes (medial retropharyngeal, mandibular and tracheobronchial) and/or in the low respiratory tract tissues (trachea, bronchus and lung). Interestingly, infectious virus was also detected in olfactory lobe, caudate nucleus of brain, cerebrum, and cerebellum in both deer euthanized on day 2 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). On day 2 pi, viral titers ranged from 1.5 to 6.5 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>), with the highest viral loads detected in the nasal turbinate of the two animals euthanized on day 2 pi (6.3 and 6.5 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). On day 5 pi, infectious virus was detected in 8 out of 24 tissues in both euthanized animals, with viral titers ranging between 1.0 to 4.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). Infectious virus was still detected in nasal turbinate (titers of 3.3 and 4.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup>) and in the olfactory lobes (titers 1.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup>) in the two deer euthanized on day 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in tissues collected from inoculated animals euthanized on day 20 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">The replication of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues was confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Nasal turbinate, palatine tonsil, medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and lung from inoculated deer euthanized on days 2 and 5 pi were examined by ISH using the RNAscope ZZ technology and positive and negative sense RNA probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and by IHC using a nucleoprotein (NP) specific mAb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Moderate to abundant staining of viral RNA and NP was observed in nasal turbinate on days 2 and 5 pi; however, viral staining was less intense on day 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Viral staining was most pronounced in cells within the mucosal epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Epithelial cells with contact to turbinate lumens were most often virus positive. Some cells in the middle and basilar portions of the epithelium were also sporadically stained. Additionally, moderate punctate staining of cells within the submucosal interstitial stroma, as well as cells associated with submucosal glandular or vascular elements were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>). Viral RNA and antigen distribution in nasal turbinate epithelial cells was consistent with detection of high levels of expression of the virus receptor ACE2 and the TMPRSS2 protease in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9A-C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Numerous tonsillar follicles and overlying epithelium presented virus specific RNA and NP staining on day 2 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Within the tonsillar crypt, virus positive epithelial cells were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Viral staining in lymphoid follicles was pronounced in the lymphocyte-rich cap and mantle regions of the tonsil, between tightly packed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). On day 5 pi SARS-CoV-2 RNA- and NP staining in crypt epithelial cells, tonsillar reticular epithelium and lymphoid follicles was similar to that observed on day 2 pi. However, in addition to staining of the follicular cap and mantle regions, virus positive cells were also noted in portions of the central germinal centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Notably, high levels of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were detected in crypt epithelial cells and in germinal centers in the tonsil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9C</xref>), two areas in which active virus replication was detected as demonstrated by antisense viral RNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). By day 20 pi, viral RNA staining was limited to germinal centers as was observed on days 2 and 5 pi (data not shown).</p>
<p id="P15">Viral staining in the mandibular and/or retropharyngeal lymph nodes was observed on days 2 and 5 pi, with the interfollicular and paracortical regions of these lymph nodes containing large foci of virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>). Additionally, a lower number of positive cells with less intense staining was observed in the germinal center mantle and central regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>). On day 20 pi, viral RNA staining within the medial retropharyngeal lymph node was characterized by low to moderate numbers of single positive cells within germinal centers (data not shown). Importantly, no evidence of viral replication (virus isolation) was observed in any of the tissues collected on day 20 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">In the lung, moderate to abundant staining of bronchial epithelial cells was observed in both animals on day 2 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and in only one animal euthanized on day 5 pi. Large foci of virus positive cells (indicative of replication) were scattered throughout bronchial epithelium with infrequent staining of individual cells within the submucosa. Staining was absent in bronchioles, alveoli, or interstitial regions. Viral staining was also observed in tracheal epithelial cells of one animal on day 2 pi, with foci of intense virus staining observed in the ciliated epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>). In general, virus-specific staining was more broadly distributed and more intense on day 2 pi with a noticeable decrease in the number of positive cells and staining intensity being observed on day 5 pi. Together these results demonstrate active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and lymphoid organs of WTD. Detection of higher viral loads in URT are consistent with higher expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal turbinate, when compared to tonsil and lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9A-C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">Here, we characterized the window in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through contact in WTD and defined important aspects of the infection dynamics and pathogenesis of the virus in this species, including its tissue tropism and sites of replication during acute infection.</p>
<p id="P19">The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is a major factor that contributed to the establishment of the virus in the human population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In WTD, we and others have shown efficient transmission of the virus to non-contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] or contact animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the patterns and dynamics of virus shedding and transmission to contact animals and demonstrated that infectious SARS-CoV-2 is shed mainly in respiratory and oral secretions during the first 5 days pi. Consistent with this, efficient transmission of the virus to contact animals only occurred during the period in which the animals were shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by productive infection of day 3 contact animals, but not of animals added on days 6 and 9 pi. Interestingly, no infectious virus was recovered from feces collected from inoculated animals between days 2 to 22 pi. These observations are relevant when considered in the context of recent studies demonstrating infection and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in wild WTD in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Our findings suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD is likely to occur mainly through respiratory or oral secretions, and the fact that no infectious virus was recovered from feces further suggests that efficient transmission of the virus would require close contact between infected and susceptible animals. Should WTD be confirmed a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, the need for close contact and the short infectious period would limit potential opportunities for transmission of the virus to other susceptible wild animal species (e.g. raccoons, and deer mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]) and to humans.</p>
<p id="P20">To better understand host selective pressures on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we analyzed whole genome sequences obtained from inoculated and contact WTD following replication and transmission of the virus over the course of the 22-day experiment. Notably, no amino acid changes were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus genome throughout the experimental period, suggesting low host-selective pressure(s) on the virus in WTD. Similar observations were reported in SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from free ranging WTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], which revealed the circulation of closely related viruses, with all sequences recovered from WTD being identical to sequences from SARS-CoV-2 obtained from humans in the same geographic region(s). This contrasts with what has been described in other animal species (e.g. tigers, lions, mink, cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets) naturally and/or experimentally infected with the virus, in which characteristic mutations mainly in the S protein have been observed shortly after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The findings in WTD can be partially explained by the high degree of homology of the human and deer ACE2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] − the entry receptor for the virus − which may favor interaction of the S protein with the cellular receptor and result in lower selective pressure for virus entry and spread to target cells in secondary sites of replication. Importantly, when we analyzed the viral subpopulations recovered from WTD, we observed the presence of low frequency (&lt;40%) variant viruses containing mutations at different loci dispersed throughout the genome. These variants, however, did not become established over the course of the experiment. The possibility, however, that beneficial viral mutations become fixed and variant strains emerge in this animal species, cannot be formally excluded.</p>
<p id="P21">Other important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and pathogenesis that were investigated in our study are its tissue tropism and sites of replication during acute infection. Our results demonstrate a broad tissue tropism of the virus, with active replication taking place in respiratory (nasal turbinate, trachea, bronchus and lung), lymphoid (palatine and pharyngeal tonsil, retropharyngeal, mandibular and tracheobronchial lymph nodes and thymus) and central nervous tissues (olfactory lobes, cerebrum, caudate nucleus of brain and cerebellum). High viral loads were observed in nasal turbinates and lymphoid tissues associated with the oral cavity (tonsils, retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes) or respiratory system (tracheobronchial lymph nodes) on days 2 and 5 pi. The high amounts of infectious virus recovered from nasal turbinate and tonsils (viral titers ranged from 3.3 to 6.5 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>.g<sup>−1</sup>) are consistent with intense viral RNA and N protein staining observed <italic>in situ</italic> and with the viral load and shedding patterns detected in respiratory secretions. This indicates that nasal turbinate and tonsil are likely the primary sites of viral replication during infection in WTD, which is similar to observations in other animal species and in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Following infection and replication in these sites, the virus likely disseminates to draining lymph nodes, the lower respiratory (trachea and lung) tract and the CNS. Efferent lymphatics from the palatine tonsil, for example, drain directly to the medial retrophayrngeal lymph nodes, which would explain the consistent involvement of that lymph node in the current study. Notably, higher viral loads and replication levels observed in nasal turbinate and tonsil, when compared to the levels observed in the lung for example, are consistent with distribution and higher expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in upper respiratory tissues.</p>
<p id="P22">Consistent with lack of virus shedding in feces, no viral RNA was detected in any of the gastrointestinal (GI) tissues collected in our study, indicating that the GI tract is not a major target of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD. An interesting finding of our study was the ability to isolate SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS of inoculated animals and may be suggestive of replicating virus in these tissues. A similar tropism has been described in transgenic hACE2 expressing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], and deer mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], in which neural invasion has been attributed to the olfactory nerve. Importantly, neurological signs following SARS-CoV-2 have also been described in humans suggesting neuroinvasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], however, WTD in our study did not present clinical signs of neurological infection. Together our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to reach and replicate in several tissues in WTD, remarkably in the nasal turbinate, tonsil and lymph nodes associated with the oral cavity and respiratory tract. The results presented here provide a detailed overview of the tissue tropism and replication sites of the virus in this highly susceptible animal species.</p>
<p id="P23">Our study extends the knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in WTD, an animal species with the potential to serve as a reservoir for the virus in the field. We defined that SARS-CoV-2 has a short window of infectivity and transmissibility in WTD, which is similar to what has been described in humans and other animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], and demonstrated that the virus presents a broad tissue tropism and multiple replication sites in this species. This information is critical to assess the relevance of natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in WTD populations and the potential risk of zoonotic spillback into humans. In our initial study demonstrating the susceptibility of WTD to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we suggested that deer and other cervids should be considered in investigations conducted to identify the origin and potential intermediate host species that may have served as the link host reservoir to humans. We had also highlighted that the high susceptibility of this species to SARS-CoV-2 combined with the constant interactions with humans could lead to opportunities for human-WTD transmission. This possibility has been recently confirmed by studies demonstrating natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in free-ranging WTD in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Several questions regarding these findings remain unanswered, perhaps the most important ones are: 1) Can WTD maintain the virus in the wild?; and 2) Can infected WTD transmit the virus back to humans? Our findings provide significant insights into the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD. Such information is critical to design appropriate epidemiological studies to help answering important questions regarding the role and potential impact of WTD in the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, and most importantly to confirm or rule out the potential role of this species as a reservoir for the virus in the field.</p>

Real-time RT-PCR amplifications were performed in 20-μl reactions, with 5 μl of RNA, 10 μl of TaqMan® RT-PCR mix (TaqMan® RNA-to-CtTM 1-Step Kit, Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of TaqMan® RT-Enzyme Mix, 1 μl of the mixture of primers and probe (PrimeTime qPCR probe assays, Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.), and 3.5 μl of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Amplification and detection were performed using CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) under following conditions: 15 min at 48 °C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 1 min at 60 °C for annealing and extension. The measurement of gene expression was performed by using the relative quantitation method (Wong, M. L., and J. F. Medrano. 2005. Real-time PCR for mRNA quantitation. Biotechniques39:75-85). Relative genome copy numbers were calculated based on the standard curve determined for each gene within CFX MaestroTM software (Bio-Rad), and expression levels of the genes tested were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. (The amount of relative mRNA detected in each sample was expressed as log2 genome copy number). Statistical analysis was performed by 2way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons and by unpaired t-test. Statistical analysis and data plotting were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (Version 9.0.1).</p>
<p id="P35">To assess ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels, nasal turbinate and palatine tonsil from controls (uninoculated) WTD were sectioned at 5 μm and subjected to IFA. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through a series of graded alcohol solutions. Antigen unmasking was performed using Tris-based antigen unmasking solution pH 9.0 (Vector Laboratories ref # H-3301) by boiling the slides in the unmasking solution for 20 min. After 10 min at 0.2% Triton X-100 (in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at room temperature (rt), and 30 min blocking using a goat normal serum (0.2% in PBS) at rt, tissues subjected to IFA. Then, were incubated for 45 min at rt using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) anti-ACE2 (Abcan ref # ab15348) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-TMPRSS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. ref # sc-515727). Followed by 30 min incubation at rt with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor® 594) and a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor® 488). Nuclear counterstain was performed with 4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) (10 min at rt) and visualized under a confocal microscopy (LSM710 Confocal - Zeiss).</p>

<p>The high susceptibility of white-tailed deer (WTD) to SARS-CoV-2, their ability to transmit the virus to other deer, and the recent findings suggesting widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild WTD populations in the U.S. underscore the need for a better understanding of the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in this potential reservoir species. Here we investigated the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over time and defined the major sites of virus replication during the acute phase of infection. Additionally, we assessed the evolution of the virus as it replicated and transmitted between animals. The work provides important information on the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD, an animal species that - if confirmed as a new reservoir of infection - may provide many opportunities for exposure and potential zoonotic transmission of the virus back to humans.</p>

<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental design of infection/transmission study in WTD fawns. Fawns were kept in separate rooms in a biosafety level 3 (agriculture) (BSL-3Ag) facility. Three fawns were maintained as control (non-inoculated) in room A, and six fawns were inoculated intranasally with 5 x 10<sup>6.38</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 isolate NYI67-20 (lineage B1) and housed in room B or C for 22 days post-inoculation (d pi). To assess viral transmission dynamics, on day 3 pi two fawns (day 3 contact [pair 1]) were moved into a clean room (room C) where the inoculated fawns were also introduced. After 48 hours, day 3 contact fawns were transferred to a separate clean room (room D), where they were mainatined until euthanized and examined on 21 days post-contact (d pc). This process was performed with two additional fawns on day 6 pi (day 6 contact [pair 2]) and two fawns on day 9 pi (day 9 contact [pair 3]), which were housed in the separate rooms E and F, respectively. Respiratory nasal secretion, feces and serum were collected on the days indicated in the figure. <bold>B</bold>) Inoculated and control fawns were microchipped subcutaneously with temperature chips prior to the experiment, and monitored daily for body temperature starting on day 1 before inoculation until day 11 pi. Additionally, daily clinical observations were performed. Body temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. Rectangle highlights normal physiological body temperature range.
