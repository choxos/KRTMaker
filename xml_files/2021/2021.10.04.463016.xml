Here, we investigated whether trans-epithelial migration across primary human airway epithelial cells (AECs) is sufficient and necessary for neutrophil activation during RSV infection. Using flow cytometry, we identified three populations of neutrophils in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model; those in suspension in basolateral and apical compartments and those that migrated and adhered to AECs. After 1h incubation, the number of adherent neutrophils was significantly greater following RSV infection compared to mock infected. We found that, when migration occurred, neutrophil expression of CD11b, CD62L, CD64, NE and MPO increased in all compartments. However, this did not occur when neutrophils were prevented from migrating. This suggests that the heightened neutrophil activation we detected in the basolateral compartment may be due to reverse migrating neutrophils, as has been suggested by clinical observations. Using live-cell fluorescent microscopy, we then profiled the early temporal and spatial movement and adherence of human neutrophils during migration. Our findings suggest three main phases of early neutrophil recruitment and behaviour in the airways during RSV infection, with neutrophil recruitment, activation and adherence to RSV infected AECs, with clustering, occurring within the first 20 minutes. This work and the model we developed could provide new insight into how neutrophil activation and a dysregulated neutrophil response to RSV mediates disease severity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract Legend</label><caption><p id="P4">Building on previous work of neutrophil function we propose 3 main phases of early neutrophil recruitment and behaviour in the airways during RSV infection. <bold>Phase 1</bold>.

Following infection, most children develop an illness which is confined to upper respiratory tract symptoms, however 1-3% of infected infants will develop a severe illness requiring hospitalisation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). There is no licensed vaccine for RSV and treatment is currently limited to supportive care. In resource-limited countries, RSV is a major cause of infant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Although risk factors have been identified, it is still not clear why RSV infected infants, with no apparent risk factors, require hospitalisation and respiratory support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). One suggestion is that neutrophils, which form around 80% of all cells recovered from the airways of infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis by bronchoalveolar lavage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and their associated cytokines contribute to disease severity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Neutrophil mediated factors such as CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL10 (IP-10) and neutrophil elastase are also present in substantial amounts in airway secretions of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Neutrophils are the predominant immune cell type in the systemic circulation and are the first cell recruited from the bloodstream through the airway epithelium during infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Here they are thought to employ largely non-specific mechanisms of pathogen destruction including phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation and release of toxic granule products such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Neutrophil trans-epithelial migration is facilitated by neutrophil receptors including integrins (i.e. CD11b) and selectins (such as CD62L) that bind to molecules on airway epithelial cells such as ICAM-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Neutrophils also interact with other immune complexes using Fc receptors such as CD64; upregulation of CD64 has been evaluated as a biomarker for neonatal sepsis in infants(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Our previous work has shown that neutrophils migrate across primary differentiated RSV infected AECs resulting in increased epithelial damage and a reduced viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). We observed that neutrophils adhere to RSV infected AECs in a clustering pattern, which was not seen in uninfected AECs. This pattern of neutrophil chemotaxis and migration has been reported using intravital microscopy, referred to as ‘neutrophil swarming’ due to a resemblance with the swarming behaviour of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We also showed that migrated neutrophils have greater cell surface expression of CD11B and MPO compared to neutrophils that had not migrated<sup>21</sup>. What remains unclear is whether migrated neutrophils with (i.e. higher CD11b) are selected for trans-epithelial migration or whether they become activated due to migration <italic>per se.</italic> Although RSV is not known establish infection outside the respiratory tract or cause a viraemia, clinical studies have shown that a high proportion of neutrophils from the systemic circulation of infants with RSV bronchiolitis contain RSV mRNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This raises the possibility that activated neutrophils, recruited to the airway during RSV infection, may be able to migrate in the reverse direction, back to the systemic circulation.</p><p id="P9">This study investigates the behaviour and function of neutrophils as they move across the airway epithelial cell layer during RSV infection. We studied this migration using a human model of primary airway epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface for 7 days. This model facilitated the higher-resolution z-stack microscopy needed for 4D (XYZT) tracking of neutrophil migration for the first time. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

We measured the concentration of these products in the compartments of our model after neutrophil migration.

Overall, transepithelial migration did not affect neutrophil viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The total counts of viable neutrophils per well, i.e. combined basolateral, apically and adherent neutrophils, is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The numbers of viable neutrophils adherent to AEC cultures infected with RSV for 24h (791.1 ± 106.8 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) or 72h (711.1 ± 74.3 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) were significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014) greater than the respective mock infected AEC cultures (449.8 ± 81.82 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) or (486.6 ± 61.5 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">However, at 72h post infection, significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006) fewer neutrophils remained adherent to mock infected AECs exposed to RSV infected AEC supernatant (462.7 ± 43.3 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), in comparison to the RSV infected AECs (711.1 ± 74.3 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This implies that neutrophil adherence is facilitated by RSV infected epithelial cells, rather than soluble, secreted factors released by RSV infected AECs alone. This was supported by our finding that RSV infection did not lead to an increase in the number of apical neutrophils (those that migrate and detach from the epithelial cells), with an average (mean ± SEM) of 22,876 ± 12,713 neutrophils/well, compared to the mock infected AEC cultures (19,184 ± 10,806) at 24h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).

To determine whether the ability of a neutrophil to migrate and adhere to epithelial cells is associated with the expression of specific cellular markers associated with neutrophil activation and migration (i.e., CD11b, CD64, CD62L, NE, MPO), we analysed neutrophils recovered from basolateral, adherent, and apical compartments using flow cytometry. We chose the 72-hour timepoint following AEC infection, and 1h timepoint after neutrophil migration for these experiments as these were the conditions that resulted in the greatest number of adherent neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>) to allow effective comparisons.</p><p id="P16">Firstly, as a control, we determined whether naïve neutrophils altered their expression of CD11b, CD64, CD62L, NE, MPO following exposure to apical supernatants recovered from mock or RSV infected AECs, but in the absence of AECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> see “NoAEC”). Here, we found a significantly greater expression of CD11b on neutrophils incubated with RSV infected AEC supernatant (4,078.3 ± 109.8) compared to neutrophils incubated with media alone (1,583.7 ± 34.3) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) or mock infected AEC supernatant (2,751 ± 37.5) (<italic>p</italic>=0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we found no significant difference in CD62L, CD64, NE or MPO expression on neutrophils incubated with supernatants from mock and RSV infected AECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3BCD&amp;E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Introducing neutrophils to our AEC model led to a significant increase in expression of CD11b and CD64 <italic>(p = 0.0002, p = 0.005)</italic> in neutrophils recovered from basolateral, adherent, apical compartments of RSV infected AEC models compared to neutrophils exposed to media alone (non-AEC control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3ABC</xref>) (comparison not directly shown on graph). Interestingly, we detected a significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0076) 24 and 30-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in CD11b expression on neutrophils recovered from the <italic>basolateral</italic> compartments of both mock (36,708 ± 3,563) and RSV infected AECs (54,389 ± 3,863) compared to neutrophils exposed to media alone (non-AEC control) (1,583.7 ± 34.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3ABC</xref>). To determine whether this was due to factors secreted into the basolateral compartment by the AECs, and therefore independent of migration, AECs were grown on membranes with a 0.4μm pore size. This smaller pore size does not permit neutrophils to move across the membrane and have contact with AECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) but will allow for passive diffusion of secreted factors. Using this system, we found that the expression of CD11b, CD64, CD62L and MPO on basolateral neutrophils exposed to AECs grown on inserts with a 0.4μm pore size did not increase and, in fact, was no different to the values obtained in the absence of AECs. Compared to neutrophils recovered from the basolateral side of the RSV infected AEC cultures grown on 0.4μm inserts, demonstrated CD11b, CD64, CD62L, NE and MPO levels that were at least 30x lower compared to those incubated on AECs grown on inserts with 3μm pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This reduction in neutrophil activation was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) across all groups tested (mock and RSV infected) suggesting the increased expression of these markers in the basolateral and adhered neutrophils is a result of direct contact with the AECs rather than infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Following trans-epithelial migration, we found that RSV infection was associated with a further 1.5-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021) in CD11b expression on apical (104,145 ± 6,631) neutrophils compared to neutrophils recovered from the respective compartments of mock infected cultures (61,466 ± 4,876) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We also measured the duration of neutrophil tracks during trans-epithelial migration (i.e., the length of time each neutrophil interacts with epithelium). Here we found that neutrophils interacted with RSV infected AECs (368μm ± 49.9) for longer than mock infected AECS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found no significant difference in linearity, or ‘track straightness’ between neutrophils observed migrating through RSV infected AECs or the mock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure</xref>).

This pattern of clustering bears resemblance to previous <italic>in vivo</italic> work which described this observation as neutrophil swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Previous in vitro assays with bacteria have indicated that dying neutrophils precede the swarm-like formation of neutrophil clusters(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). To determine probable source of the nucleation point in our model, we segmented a region of interest immediately adjacent the cluster nucleus (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) and tracked the neutrophils in the preceding 0-20 minutes. This data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5GH</xref>) shows that the timing of the death (loss of viability stain) of a single neutrophil (labelled #1 in Figure 6GH) correlated to the amplified recruitment of the neutrophil population at 20 min, that was directed towards the unviable neutrophil (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 4</xref>). This indicates that neutrophil death may serve as a catalyst for swarming during RSV infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">This study has, for the first time, performed spatial, temporal and functional analysis on migrating neutrophils in response to RSV infection of primary human airway epithelial cells.

</p><p id="P31">Firstly, we found that RSV infection led to greater, but slower, net movement of neutrophils across RSV infected AECs in comparison to mock infected AECs. This contradicted with our findings that, in the absence of AECs, neutrophils moved faster towards RSV infected supernatants (that contained elevated levels of the potent neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL8 (IL-8) and CXCL10 (IP-10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), compared to neutrophils exposed to mock infected AEC supernatants. This suggests that an airway epithelial cell factor is responsible for slowing down the migration of neutrophils in the RSV infected AEC model. This could be due to the interaction of epithelial ICAM-1 to neutrophil integrin LFA-1, as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Alternatively, cell syncytia formation, a known histopathological characteristic of RSV infection, could increase epithelial impedance by reducing the availability of accessible cell-cell junctions through which migration may occur(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This may not only slow down the initial neutrophil response to RSV infection, but also prolong its duration and slow its resolution, contributing to a heightened period of inflammation.</p><p id="P32">Secondly, we found that trans-epithelial migration led to apical (but not basolateral) secretion of soluble neutrophil granular factors including MMP9, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and neutrophil elastase (NE) that correlated to epithelial damage. Migration also led to greater expression of neutrophil activation markers CD11b, CD64, CD62L, NE and MPO, with highest expression recorded on neutrophils recovered from the apical compartment of RSV infected AECs. Interestingly, neutrophils recovered from <italic>basolateral</italic> compartments of the AEC model also increased expression of CD11b, CD64, CD62L and MPO, but not NE, compared to the no-AEC control. This is supported by clinical studies of children hospitalised with RSV bronchiolitis, which showed that neutrophils with upregulated CD11b were recoverable both from the airways by bronchiolar lavage and from peripheral circulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophils recovered from peripheral circulation of infants with RSV bronchiolitis have been shown to contain RSV mRNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Viraemia due to RSV has not, to our knowledge, been observed clinically, which suggests that the virus causes symptoms because of its effects on the respiratory tract. This poses an important question: are activated neutrophils preferentially selected for migration or does the process of trans-epithelial migration increase expression of neutrophils activation markers? To address this, we cultured our AECs on membrane inserts with a smaller pore size (0.4μm), that prevented neutrophil migration. Here, following RSV infection, we did not find any difference in CD11b, CD64, CD62L and MPO expression on basolateral neutrophils compared to neutrophils exposed to media alone (no AECs). This suggests that neutrophils increase their expression of CD11b, CD64, CD62L and MPO during or following migration, rather than an existing sub-population of activated neutrophils being selected for migration. This was different for NE. Here we detected a decrease in NE expression when neutrophils were exposed to basolateral side of RSV infected AECs, compared to mock infected. as a similar pattern in NE expression is seen when comparing neutrophils exposed to the no-AEC mock and RSV supernatants, suggesting that secreted factors may drive this change. Therefore, the presence of these ‘activated’ neutrophils on the <italic>basolateral</italic> side of the AECs following migration, may suggest that neutrophils, which are ‘activated’ by the apical environment, reverse migrate to the basolateral side of AECs (see Graphical Abstract). To investigate this further, we analysed the Z-tracks of neutrophils migrating across RSV infected AECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). This showed that neutrophils can move bidirectionally across the AECs, quickly migrating to the apical side of RSV infected airway epithelium and returning to the basolateral compartment, as soon as 15 minutes after migration.</p><p id="P33">Next, we found that RSV infection led to greater numbers of neutrophils remaining adherent to RSV infected AECs. This may be due to increased expression of host cell receptors including ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), which we (and others) have previously shown to be upregulated <italic>in vitro</italic> airway models of RSV infection, and mediate neutrophil adherence to RSV infected AECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In support of this, we found that fewer neutrophils remained adherent to mock infected AECs exposed to RSV infected supernatant placed apically (in comparison to RSV infected AECs). This suggests that properties of the epithelial cells, rather than the apical milieu of the RSV infected epithelium <italic>per se,</italic> are responsible for neutrophil adherence. Interestingly, neutrophils were observed to adhere in clusters to the apical surface of RSV infected AECs. Neutrophil clustering has been shown as a vital mechanism for host defence against pathogens(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, large clusters have been associated with inflammatory disease in both human and murine models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). In models of RSV infection, increased neutrophil adherence and clustering has been associated with greater AEC damage (21,22,32,33).</p><p id="P34">To examine the formation of these clusters in more detail, we used higher-resolution time-lapse microscopy to image the early movement of neutrophils moving across RSV infected AECs. This showed that clusters can result from the coordinated convergence of neutrophils, which resembled reports of neutrophil swarming in response to infection and sterile injury in <italic>in vivo</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This pattern of neutrophil movement is thought to be initiated by the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from neutrophils, which induce a transcriptional switch in their neighbours and coordinate a collective movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). LTB4 is a leukotriene DAMP, released by dying neutrophils and has been shown to mediate this directed leukocyte movement previously (24,30,35,36). We also showed that neutrophil death, or loss of cell viability, may serve as a catalyst for swarming during RSV infection. Here, we speculate that the formation of clusters of neutrophils, seen in our model, is not mediated by the RSV infected AECs, but instead due to neutrophils themselves triggering and maintaining clustering behaviour. The ability of neutrophils to affect others around them is an emerging area of research, and neutrophil quorum signalling has been shown to coordinate neutrophil collective responses to wound healing(23,24,37). Whether this response is a natural protective mechanism in countering an RSV infection or an aberrant response remains to be fully explained, but focal damage to AECs <italic>in vivo</italic> may allow increased neutrophil migration.</p><p id="P35">In summary, neutrophil activation has been shown as a key precursor to the development of severe respiratory symptoms in children with RSV bronchiolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Here we have shown that contact of neutrophils with AECs and/or trans-epithelial migration through RSV infected AECs is essential for upregulation of neutrophil activation markers, including CD11b expression. We describe distinct, measurable patterns of neutrophil movement, including the formation of neutrophil clusters on RSV infected AECs. We present evidence of the bidirectional movement of neutrophils across AECs during RSV infection and return of activated neutrophils to the basolateral side of infected AECs. This could explain how neutrophils with upregulated CD11b and presence of viral products were recoverable in blood neutrophils of babies with RSV bronchiolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>),(23,34,37) and could have important systemic implications for severe disease sequalae. This is a critical area for discovery and the model that we have developed here could be used to unravel important disease mechanisms, including the key question of how RSV accesses extra-pulmonary sites during infection. Future work should include the identification of new biomarkers of specific neutrophils sub-populations responsible for driving severe disease outcomes; screening anti-inflammatory drugs; and determining new mechanisms that may aid disease resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P36">Peripheral blood and airway epithelial cells were obtained from healthy adult donors at UCL GOS Institute of Child Health.

AECs cells were cultured on porous PET inserts (Greiner) with pore size of 3μm to allow migration or 0.4μm to prohibit it. AEC cultures were infected with RSV 24 or 72 hours prior to the addition of neutrophils. Mock infected AECs with RSV infected AEC supernatant were used as a control (RSV Sup), as were mock infected AECs with n-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) 100nM placed apically as a positive control for neutrophil chemotaxis. 400μl of supernatant was added underneath the membrane insert for each experimental group, Mock, RSV, RSV supernatants only and fMLP control. Excess supernatant prior to neutrophil migration was stored at -20 for use in chemotaxis and activation experiments. Neutrophils were then added to the basolateral side of all membrane inserts, then left to incubate for 1 or 4 hours. After migration, neutrophils were collected from the apical side of the epithelial cells for quantification. Supernatants were collected and membrane inserts were fixed and stained.

Graphs indicate neutrophils recovered from the basolateral, adherent, and apical (migrated) compartments within the assay. Neutrophils incubated with fMLP and RSV MOI 1 (virus) in media without AEC were also used as controls. Bars indicate standard error of the mean. A linear model of mixed effects was used to compare interactions between infection and location groups and control for intra-donor variability.

Here, after 1h incubation with RSV infected AECs, neutrophils on the basolateral side 1) and 2) were shown to express the same level of CD11b markers, indicating that neutrophil contact with AECs and starting to move through the AECs is key process for increasing expression of these activation markers.
