Yet little is known about electric-field effects on protein function. Here we use phototriggered charge injection from a site-specifically attached ruthenium photosensitizer to directly demonstrate the effects of charge redistribution within a protein. We find that binding of an antibody to phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is increased two folds under illumination. Remarkably, illumination is found to suppress the enzymatic activity of PGK by a factor as large as three. These responses are sensitive to the photosensitizer position on the protein. Surprisingly, left (but not right) circularly polarized light elicits these responses, indicating that the electrons involved in the observed dynamics are spin polarized, due to spin filtration by protein chiral structures. Our results directly establish the contribution of electrical polarization as an allosteric signal within proteins. Future experiments with phototriggered charge injection will allow delineation of charge rearrangement pathways within proteins and will further depict their effects on protein function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Biomolecules within the living cell are subject to extensive electrical fields, particularly next to membranes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Indeed, a role for bioelectricity has been well established at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). While the importance of electrostatics in protein functions such as protein-protein association and enzymatic activity has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), very little is known on how biomolecules respond to external electric fields, or in other words, what may be the potential contribution of polarizability to protein function. Multiple protein activities involve electrostatic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). For example, it is recognized that the association kinetics of proteins can be accelerated by charged residues positioned close to the interaction sites on their surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Recent work on enzyme catalysis has given rise to a picture of pre-organized charges at catalytic sites, directly influencing substrate molecules and lowering enzymatic reaction barriers in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). These mechanisms for charge influence on protein function invoke essentially fixed charge distributions, and do not take into account the potential role of charge regulation and reorganization due to external electric fields(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Yet, it is important to appreciate that any interaction between two proteins, as well as between a protein and other molecular species, involves the formation of an effective electric field that results from the difference in electrochemical potentials of the two interacting bodies.</p><p id="P4">Since proteins have low dielectric interiors, variations in charge positions and electric fields that result from interactions, may have relatively long-range effects. Due to their internal conformational dynamics, as well as the presence of titratable side chains, proteins may possess significant polarizability values. Recent simulations from Takano and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and experimental work from our labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) have indeed hinted at a role for charge reorganization as an allosteric signal in proteins. Here we decisively establish this role by studying the effect of phototriggered charge injection on both protein-protein association kinetics and enzyme kinetics. We find a rich spectrum of responses that depends on the position of the photoexcited group as well as on the spin polarization of the rearranging charges. The spin dependence is likely associated with the chiral induced spin selectivity effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Modulating protein-protein association</title><p id="P5">We site-specifically labeled phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a 415-residue protein, with the photosensitizer ([Ru(2,2’-bipyridine)2(5-iodoacetamido 1,10-phenanthroline)]<sup>2+</sup> (Ru) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In particular, we created the mutant C97S/Q9C, in which the native cysteine at position 97 was changed to a serine, and a cysteine residue was inserted at position 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Ru can inject either an electron or a hole into the protein, potentially modulating the charge distribution (i.e., the electric polarization) within the protein. We first studied the binding of an anti-His antibody to a polyhistidine tag at the C terminus of PGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). The Ru-PGK construct was attached to a gold surface to facilitate uniform illumination and readout of antibody-antigen interaction. The antibody molecules were labeled with the dye Alexa 647, which allowed counting individual events of protein-protein association at the surface at different times, following the addition of the antibody to the solution. The experiment was performed either under illumination with a linearly polarized (LP) 470 nm laser or in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B-E</xref>). The kinetics traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> demonstrate that under illumination association was significantly enhanced at early times. In particular, at 2 s, illumination increased the association rate by a factor of 2.25±0.05. At longer times the difference between the two sets decreased, reaching a similar value at 8 s, due to saturation of the binding of antibody molecules to the surface. In the rest of the article, we will therefore report only rate differences at 2 s. The experiment was repeated with PGK molecules that were not labeled with Ru, and no effect of illumination was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). We further repeated the same experiment on glass to rule out any potential contribution of the gold surface, and the results were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P6">As it is known that electron transport through a protein may be spin selective, due to the chirality of the protein and its secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), we asked whether illumination with circularly polarized light can modulate the observed effect. The experiment on the gold surface was therefore repeated with either right or left circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized light is likely to generate excitations with one spin state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), so that the injected charge into the protein (either positive or negative) would be spin polarized. Remarkably, the enhancement of the association kinetics was observed only with left circularly polarized (LCP) light, and not with right circularly polarized (RCP) light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). These results indicate, within the experimental uncertainty, that the whole photoinduced effect an outcome of essentially a single spin polarization, suggesting in turn that the charge reorganization within the protein is spin selective.</p><p id="P7">To test the position dependence of the charge reorganization effect on association kinetics, the Ru complex was moved to residue 290, using the mutant C97S/S290C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). At this position, the photosensitizer is much further away from the His-tag at the C terminus compared to the previous position; the distance from residue 290 to the C terminus, residue 415, is 55 Å, based on the crystal structure 3PGK, while from residue 9 it is only ~10 Å. Repeating the same experiment, it was found that illumination (either LP, LCP or RCP) had only a minor effect on the association reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>), pointing to a significant position dependence of the effect.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Controlling enzymatic activity</title><p id="P8">We then turned to measure the effect of photosensitization on the catalytic reaction of PGK. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), producing ADP and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To observe a robust reaction on a surface, the His-tag at the C terminus of PGK was used to attach protein molecules to a supported lipid bilayer formed on a glass substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The turnover of surface-bound enzyme molecules was measured using a coupled assay, and the kinetics were gauged through a change in NADH absorbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Based on the slopes of the kinetics curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-E</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Table 2</xref>), and assuming a surface density of PGK molecules of ~5·10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> (somewhat lower than expected for a close-packed layer of the protein), we calculated a turnover rate of ~200 s<sup>-1</sup> for Q9C PGK and S290C PGK in the dark. This turnover rate is quite close to the value measured in solution with C97S PGK (226.9±7.3 s<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p id="P9">Remarkably, with Ru at position 290, the enzymatic rate decreased under illumination by a factor of 3.3±0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). As above, this rate reduction was induced by either LP or LCP illumination, but not under RCP illumination. The effect could be observed in a single experiment: when light was turned off, the slope of the kinetics curve increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the absence of Ru, no effect of illumination was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1A</xref>). When the Ru complex was moved to position 9, an illumination effect was still observed, but it was significantly reduced to a factor of only 1.8±0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>); as above, the slope increased when light was turned off, and no illumination effect was observed in the absence of Ru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P10">When a protein interacts with a charged molecule/protein, charge rearrangement occurs within the protein, which may affect the interaction between the protein and the other species. The extent of charge rearrangement depends on the polarizability of the protein, and therefore polarizability may affect both interaction between proteins and enzymatic activity. Upon excitation of a photosensitizer, charge can be injected into the protein, hence affecting its polarizability, thereby modulating the effect discussed above. Charge injection can involve either an electron or a hole, and might potentially be only partial, leading in either way to an effect on the charge distribution within the protein. However, since the protein is chiral, any charge injection would be spin dependent due to the chiral induced spin selective (CISS) effect, as shown by Naaman and coworkers in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Exciting the dye with circularly polarized light causes one spin to be preferentially excited. Due to the CISS effect, one specific spin can be injected more efficiently into the protein. Therefore, one circular polarization is more effective than the other. Excitation with the ‘correct’ circular polarization would lead to charge injection into the protein and to a charge-separated species that would typically have a much longer lifetime than the usual excitation lifetime of the molecule. On the other hand, excitation of the ‘wrong’ circular polarization would not lead to charge injection, and the excited state would relax quickly, either radiatively or non-radiatively.</p><p id="P11">Our results indeed indicate a significant effect of charge injection from the photosensitizer Ru into the protein both on association with an antibody and on its enzymatic reaction. Notably, the effects we measure depend on the polarization of light and in particular, respond to only one circular polarization. Our findings strongly support the notion that charge reorganization is involved, as it has been established that the motion of charge through a chiral potential is spin selective and is affected by the protein secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This spin dependence is due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Importantly, it has been shown previously that spin polarization enables long range charge transfer through chiral systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Specifically for our systems, we can only speculate on the exact effect of charge injection and in which direction charge is transferred. In the case of the antibody-protein interaction, since the antibody is directed to the His-tag, we observe the C-terminal region of the protein (where the His-tag is connected) and find that it is in general more negative. Clearly, the protein-protein association reaction would benefit from this region being even more negative, meaning that an electron would likely be injected from the photosensitizer. In the case of the enzymatic reaction, charge reorganization may affect substrate binding by making the active site more negatively charged and changing its interaction with the negatively charged substrate molecules. Additionally, charge reorganization may affect the catalytic mechanism itself. We cannot be more specific about this aspect at this moment of time. In any case, since charge reorganization is found to be sensitive to circularly polarized light, it is likely that α-helical structures of the protein are involved, as α-helices have been implicated as good spin filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The photoinduced charge injection effect we observe here depends on the distance from the active site involved, rather than on the sequence separation. Thus, for protein-protein association at the C terminus of PGK, Ru at position 9 had a strong effect, while Ru at position 290 had no effect. A similar picture arose also for the enzymatic activity of PGK, though now Ru at position 290 (close to the ATP binding site) showed double the effect of Ru at position 9.</p><p id="P14">The findings here, combined with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), point to a new role of charge reorganization, or of polarizability, in modulating protein activities. Surprisingly, not much is known about the involvement of polarizability in protein function, though the development of polarizable force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules in recent years may change this situation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The role of charged protein residues in enzymatic catalysis has been discussed extensively by Warshel and coworkers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), who emphasized the contribution of charges that are pre-organized to reduce the free energy of the transition state. Recent work from the Boxer lab has experimentally demonstrated that charges at the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase exert an electric field that contributes significantly to the catalytic effect(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, these charges are considered to be static. We suggest instead that the electric field at the active site of an enzyme may be modulated through the binding of charged groups at distant sites or by the presence of bioelectric fields.</p><p id="P15">Indeed, our current results indicate that this is the case. The excitation of the Ru moiety likely leads to a propagation of a polarization signal through the protein, reaching and affecting the active site. A significant effect is demonstrated here on both the binding of an antibody to the His-tag of PGK and, most remarkably, on its enzymatic activity. The effect on the activity of PGK might be due either to modulation of the binding of substrates or to an effect on the catalytic step itself- this remains to be determined. In any case, these findings point to a so-far unappreciated role of electric fields in the regulation of biological activity at the molecular level. Within the cellular environment, electric fields abound particularly near membranes, and it is possible that membrane proteins and also proteins that interact with membranes are susceptible to control mediated by charge reorganization. This discovery also suggests a novel method for generating photo-controlled enzymes and sensors, based on photoexcitation of an attached group. Currently, all proposed methods to photo-control bioactivity have relied on various conformational changes induced by photoexcitation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Photo-controlling bioactivity through charge injection might be easier to implement. Future work will allow us to optimize the location of the photosensitizer and enhance the effect of light on activity even further and will teach us more about pathways of charge rearrangement in relation to protein function. For that purpose, we plan to identify biological systems that might be particularly susceptible to this type of activity regulation in proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P16">Yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) DNA was cloned into a pET28b vector, fused to a C-terminal 6xHis tag.

The enzymatic activity of PGK variants was measured at 25 °C by monitoring the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm using the coupled assay described by Reddy et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>): <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ATP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>PG</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟶</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>M</mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PGK</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:munderover></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>ADP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>BPG</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NADH</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>BPG</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟶</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>GAPDH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>GAP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Pi</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>NA</mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P27">For the activity assay, 100 μl of a solution containing ATP (Adenosine 5’-triphosphate disodium salt hydrate, A2383, Sigma), 3-PG (D-(−)-3-Phosphoglyceric acid disodium salt, P8877, Sigma), EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, BioPrep), NADH (β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced dipotassium salt, N4505, Sigma) and GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle, G2267, Sigma) were added above His-PGK attached to the lipid bilayer on the glass bottom Petri dish. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution. Final concentrations of the reagents were 5 mM ATP, 10 mM 3-PG, 1 mM EDTA, 200-600 μM NADH, 10 units/ml GAPDH and 6 mM MgCl2. Aliquots were taken at specific time intervals and the decrease of NADH absorption was measured as a function of time. From the ratio of slope of the plot of NADH absorption vs. time for different reaction conditions (e.g. in absence or presence of illumination with linearly or circularly polarized light), we determined the change of enzyme activity with respect to reaction condition. The turnover number was calculated from the slope of the change of NADH concentration vs. time.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Optical setup for excitation of sample with linear or circularly polarized light</title><p id="P28">A 470 nm diode laser (Picoquant) was relayed through achromatic lenses to expand and collimate the beam to a diameter of 1 cm. A polarizer cube was used to modulate the polarization to excite the sample with linearly polarized light. In case of excitation with circular polarization, a quarter wave plate was introduced at the appropriate angle just before the sample chamber. We verified that at the sample light was circularly polarized to within ~10% by rotating a polarizer and measuring the power. The laser intensity (~5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the sample was kept constant for linear as well as circular polarization by tuning the laser power at the source. While the relatively low laser intensity implies a low efficiency of excitation, potentially long charge recombination times are likely to lead to a significant fraction of charge-separated protein molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS151088-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was partially supported by a grant to G.H. from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 742637, SMALLOSTERY), a grant from the Israel Science Foundation (no. 1250/19) and a grant from the Weizmann SABRA - Yeda-Sela – WRC program.

enzyme kinetics, is well documented. Here we go beyond this static picture and show that charge motions can exert significant effects on protein function. Injecting charge from a photosensitizer, we demonstrate a three-fold decrease in enzymatic activity and a two-fold increase of antibody-antigen binding. These effects depend on the specific position of the photosensitizer on the protein. Our results point to charge reorganization as a form of allostery that complements known allosteric mechanisms such as conformational changes and dynamics.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A.</bold> Structure of Phosphoglycerate kinase (3PGK): Red line represents the 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the protein.

PGK molecules were attached to a lipid layer supported on a glass surface through their His-tags. The enzymatic reaction of PGK is depicted in the cartoon. Enzymatic activity was measured at 25 °C using a coupled assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) and the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm was monitored. <bold>B.</bold> A strong reduction in enzyme kinetics was observed upon either LP or LCP illumination of PGK modified with Ru at position 290, but not under RCP illumination, as compared to no light (NL). <bold>C.</bold> The slope of reaction progression changed when the initial LP illumination was stopped after 5 min (full symbols). In the absence of Ru, no effect of light was observed (empty symbols). <bold>D.</bold> The effect of light was smaller when Ru was at position 9. As in B, the effect was observed under LP or LCP illumination, but not under RCP illumination. <bold>E.</bold> As in C, but with Ru at position 9.
