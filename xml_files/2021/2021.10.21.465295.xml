The growing community generated a broad spectrum of applications, linker types, acquisition strategies and specialized data analysis tools, which makes it challenging, especially for newcomers, to decide for an appropriate analysis workflow. Therefore, we here present a large and flexible synthetic peptide library as reliable instrument to benchmark crosslinkers with different reactive sites as well as acquisition techniques and data analysis algorithms. Additionally, we provide a tool, IMP-X-FDR, that calculates the real, experimentally validated, FDR, compares results across search engine platforms and analyses crosslink properties in an automated manner. The library was used with the reagents DSSO, DSBU, CDI, ADH, DHSO and azide-a-DSBSO and data were analysed using the algorithms MeroX, MS Annika, XlinkX, pLink 2, MaxLynx and xiSearch. We thereby show that the correct algorithm and search setting choice is highly important to improve ID rate and FDR in combination with software and sample-complexity specific score cut-offs. When analysing DSSO data with MS Annika, we reach high identification rates of up to ~70 % of the theoretical maximum (i.e. 700 unique lysine-lysine cross-links) while maintaining a low real FDR of &lt; 3 % at cross-link level and with high reproducibility, representatively showing that our test system delivers valuable and statistically solid results.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F9" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS144274-f009"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Crosslinking</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>synthetic peptide library</kwd><kwd>FDR control</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The field of cross-linking mass spectrometry has matured and now represents a frequently used technique for the investigation of protein structures as well as to freeze (transient) protein-protein interactions and uncover whole interactomes on a system wide level. Numerous reviews already summarized successful applications but also limitations of this technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> The growing community also participated in the generation of a wide variety of cross-linker reagents bearing chemical reactivities mainly towards lysine (e.g. via N-Hydroxysuccinimide esters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>) but also towards acidic amino acids (e.g. by amide formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>or hydrazines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>), cysteine (e.g. via maleimides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>) or even without any specificity (e.g. via diazirine groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>). With a focus on proteome wide studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> cross linking, MS-cleavable linkers, like DSSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> or DSBU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, are facilitating data analysis by generating characteristic doublet ions and became commonly used. Aiming to dig deeper in the interactome of complex samples, reagents bearing an affinity tag for selective enrichment of cross-linked peptides were further developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> The optimization of cross-linker specific acquisition strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and most recently the implementation of ion-mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or FAIMS filtering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> as additional separation technique further boosted the number of possible crosslink (XL) identifications.</p><p id="P4">The broad spectrum of applications, linker types and acquisition strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> led to the development of lots of specialized data analysis tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> which makes it challenging, especially for newcomers, to decide for an appropriate analysis workflow.</p><p id="P5">Therefore, a synthetic peptide library as previously published by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> is a valuable tool for standardization and can be used as a basis to decide for the optimal analysis tool in dependency of the used crosslinker and acquisition strategy. The previous peptide library was based on 95 synthetic peptides of the protein Cas9.</p><p id="P6">In this study we present a significantly improved and extended peptide library that now contains a total of 141 peptides from 38 different proteins of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal complex. This enables finding inter- and intra-protein cross-links in our results. Furthermore, the number of theoretical correct cross-link combinations is increased from 426 in the previously published version to up to 1018 in this library. In conclusion a more reliable and, if supported by the data analysis tool, separate inter/intra false discovery rate (FDR) calculation can be performed. In contrast to our previously published library system of Cas9, the peptides were now combined to 3 different libraries designed to be compatible not only with lysine but also with aspartic- and glutamic-acid reactive cross-linkers as well as for crosslinkers bearing an azide as affinity tag, respectively.</p><p id="P7">With the here reported peptide library, we mimic a real protein complex and a system that is appropriate to find optimal settings for real biological samples as well as to benchmark different crosslinker types and data analysis tools.</p><p id="P8">To increase the usability of that library, we additionally created a tool, IMP-X-FDR, that is capable to check the target-decoy based FDR estimation given by search engines and instead outputs the "real", experimentally validated, FDR. Additionally, the tool can correct the number of cross-link IDs to a real FDR of 1 or 5% by applying a score-cutoff as well as to compare the results obtained from several search engines or cross-linkers in Venn Diagrams. IMP-X-FDR completes this task in an automated manner and includes an easy-to-use graphical user interface, which broadens the potential user group. IMP-X-FDR is free to use and can be downloaded from Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fstanek/imp-x-fdr">https://github.com/fstanek/imp-x-fdr</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P9">We synthesized 141 peptides based on sequences from 38 proteins of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). They are designed to contain exactly one crosslink-able position. Peptides are grouped to 6 - 10 peptides and crosslinked groupwise. After that, all groups are pooled to obtain the crosslinked library were links between peptides of different groups or to not synthesized peptides are known false positives. The main library consists of 100 peptides containing exactly one crosslink-able lysine residue. All peptides start with the sequence WGGGGR- and their n-termini are protected by an acetate group to hinder any crosslink reaction at this position. Tryptophan thereby facilitates photometric quantitation of peptides after synthesis. C-terminal lysine residues are modified to an azide (instead of an amine) to again block the crosslink reaction. During sample processing the protected n-terminal sequence part is removed by tryptic digestion and azide modified lysine's are reduced to amines yielding ordinary tryptic peptides with a known crosslink position for MS/MS analysis. We additionally compiled a library not containing any azide protected lysine residue but instead exclusively those 64 peptides of the main library ending with arginine. This "enrichable library" is compatible with azide-based affinity enrichment as done with the reagent azide-tagged acid-cleavable disuccinimidylbissulfoxide, (DSBSO). Finally, a third library, made from 43 peptides, is designed to contain exactly one reactive aspartic-acid or glutamic-acid for use with crosslinker reagents reactive to carboxylic acids. In this "acidic library" the c-terminal peptide part is amide protected and all sequences end as GGGG after a K or R which will again release ordinary tryptic peptides after digestion.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Benchmarking crosslink search engines with linkers targeting lysine</title><p id="P10">To benchmark commonly used crosslink search-algorithms we applied the MS cleavable linker reagents disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), ureido-4,4'-dibutyric acid bis(hydroxysuccinimide) ester (DSBU) and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to the main library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). As representatively shown on the data generated with DSSO the benchmarked search engines all output higher experimentally validated FDRs than the estimated 1% on crosslink level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). For this dataset MS Annika<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and MaxLynx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> perform best, both by means of correct FDR estimation as well as by means of unique ID numbers. We additionally applied post-score-cutoffs to correct the experimentally validated FDR to ≤ 1%. The obtained results are in line with minimal scores recommended by the software developers (i.e. scores &gt;100 are considered as good for MeroX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, 50 is default and 75 seems reliable from our data; 40 is default for XlinkX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, 41 seems reliable from our data). Although using a score-cutoff is an effective strategy to correct for acceptable FDR, our data also shows, that built in (usually target-decoy based) FDR estimations are not sufficient yet. Especially when using pLink 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we had the impression that (score-based) separation of correct and incorrect IDs does not work properly meaning that the majority of crosslink IDs is lost upon applying our FDR correction. Of note, pLink 2 was initially designed to work with non-MS-cleavable linker reagents and is not optimized for HCD data in combination with cleavable linkers, which might explain its weak performance in this dataset compared to all other tested algorithms.</p><p id="P11">Instead of using score cutoff values, the comparison of identified crosslinks with more than one search engine can significantly contribute to improve the confidence in results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using our in house-developed tool IMP-X-FDR we visualized the overlap of search results obtained from MS Annika and a second search engine and calculated the FDR in an automated manner (Examples of output Figures automatically created by IMP-X-FDR are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5 and 6</xref>). The fraction of commonly identified unique crosslinks contains up to 629 entries (Annika + MeroX) and within this fraction the experimentally validated FDR is ≤ 1.4 % in all cases and therefore very close to the accepted 1%. On the contrary those crosslinks exclusively identified by only one search engine contain most false positives yielding to FDR rates of up to 31%. A similar effect is also observed for replicate measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of 425 unique crosslinks commonly found in three replicates only 2 (0.5 %) were incorrect. While using crosslinks commonly found across replicate measurements seems to yield highly confident results, the accumulation of IDs from several replicate measurements to boost link numbers is prone to also ac-cumulate wrong hits and should therefore be avoided. We further investigated those two crosslinks that were incorrectly assigned in all three replicates using Annika (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>): The first one is a homeotypic link of the peptide MAKLTK that does not exist in the library (but in the database used to search the files). A peptide with the sequence MAKTIK of the same mass is however part of our library and was therefore very likely generating the wrongly annotated spectra. The second one connects two existing peptides (LSYDTEASIAKAK- VAVIKAVR) that are however within different groups.</p><p id="P12">In a next step we benchmarked the reagents DSSO, DSBU and CDI on the main library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A and B</xref>). Expectedly, the performance of DSSO and DSBU is on a similar level, since both have comparable spacer lengths of 10.1 and 12.5 A respectively and the same reactive site. The two linkers bear different reactive groups for MS based fragmentation which might lead to the assumption that differences in spectra quality explain the slight difference in unique link numbers. Notably this effect is software specific. Annika performs very well with DSSO and scores DSSO crosslinks better than DSBU links (average score 279 for all DSSO links vs 269 for all DSBU links from our main library). In contrast MeroX performs very well with DSBU and scores those links slightly better (average score 131 for all DSSO links vs 133 for all DSBU links from our main library). In conclusion, when comparing MeroX results, DSBU (767 links on average) outperforms DSSO (658 links on average) in terms of unique crosslinks (data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The zero length crosslinker CDI yielded in ≤ 80 unique crosslinks identified with all tested algorithms. This low number might be reasoned by no "real" interaction sites within the peptide library that relies on crosslink connections formed between freely moving peptides in solution. Therefore, the likelihood of two peptides being connected by a crosslinker with a very short spacer is lowered compared to those linkers with a 10 – 12 Å spacer. A full list of unique link numbers and experimentally validated FDRs using all tested algorithms can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 2</xref>.</p><p id="P14">Next, we compared detectability of DSSO vs DSBSO using the enrichable peptide library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 C and D</xref>). In this artificial system any potential steric hindrance of the azide tag of DSBSO can be neglected, hence we assume that differences in observed crosslinks are reasoned mainly by the ionizability of the resulting connected peptides. As illustrated in the Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 D</xref>, the overlap of identified crosslinks is indeed very high and could not be distinguished to an overlap of replicate measurements from the same linker (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 B</xref>). DSSO only slightly, though significantly, outperforms DSBSO by means of crosslink numbers indicating a slightly increased reactivity or ionizability.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Benchmarking crosslink search engines with carboxylic acid reactive linkers</title><p id="P15">Next, we investigated two reagents targeting acidic amino acids: The non-cleavable adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) and the cleavable dihydrazide sulfoxide (DHSO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These linkers were applied to a smaller peptide library with a reduced number of only 280 theoretically possible crosslinks formed, however, less than 40 % of this number was identified in all cases. This indicates a lowered reaction efficiency compared to the more established NHS ester-based linkers, where more than 60 % of the theoretical crosslink number was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For the non-cleavable ADH linker, pLink 2 and MaxLynX seem to perform significantly better, both by means of reliability and ID numbers, than their competitors. However, calculated experimentally validated FDR values seem extraordinarily high for both reagents and every software tested on the acidic library. A proper FDR calculation might be hindered by the relatively small number of crosslinks available in this system.</p><p id="P17">Of note, 4-methylmorpholinium chloride (DMTMM), that was used as coupling reagent for ADH and DHSO, could form zero-length connections between amines and carboxylic acids. However, only two synthetic peptides of the acidic library contain any lysine residue except for those that are terminal after tryptic cleavage. We investigated the presence of DMTMM crosslinked (undigested) peptides and found no evidence for such a side reaction. The low number of crosslink identifications in the acidic library might be reasoned by a slow reaction kinetics and the fact that two steps (activation of carboxylic acids by DMTMM followed by nucleophilic attack of the hydrazine group) are required instead of only one as is the case for NHS based reagents. To boost the number of crosslink IDs we further tested DHSO on a pool of all 41 peptides of the acidic library. This increases the number to possible crosslink combinations from 280 to 946 and therefore close to the value of the main library. The number of identified crosslinks maintained low at ~20% of the theoretical maximum when using Annika (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To better understand the reaction chemistry of these hydrazine-based linkers, we analyzed the results obtained for DHSO using our in house developed tool IMP-X-FDR to investigate the distribution of amino acids in detected crosslink-sequence-matches (CSMs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4 A and B</xref>). We thereby compared the average frequency of specific amino acids in proximity to the crosslinked aspartic- or glutamic-acid in identified CSMs to the theoretically expected distribution. The theoretical distribution was calculated from all, in silico generated, crosslinks that can exist within the acidic library (either cross-linked in separate groups or within one pooled group) under the assumption that every crosslink combination led to exactly one CSM. By that, missing or predominant combinations can be visualized. For both DHSO based datasets (pooled and separate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 C</xref>) similar dependencies popped up: Histidine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and glutamine seem to reproducibly hinder the formation or identification of a crosslink from the acidic library. The frequency of amino acids within identified linear peptide sequence matches of the (non-crosslinked) acidic library was compared to the theoretical amino acid distribution under the assumption of equimolar peptide quantities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4 C</xref>) in an additional experiment. Thereby the same MS method as for crosslink samples was used, meaning that exclusively ions with a charge ≥3 were selected for fragmentation. With this we bias the method to detect longer and higher charged peptides while not recording the majority of linear peptides. This alters the expected amino-acid distribution as peptides with amino acids carrying a positive charge are preferentially detected, enabling a fair comparison to the amino acid-distribution seen in our cross-linked samples. We indeed found fewer peptides containing isoleucine than expected, but clearly more peptides than expected containing histidine. All other amino acids that seemed to have a negative impact on crosslink formation were found in relative frequencies as expected. Except for isoleucine this data strengthens the hypothesis that those amino acids negatively influence the reactivity of DHSO. Especially the basic histidine might cross-react with the activated carboxylic acid to form an intrapeptidal link, therefore impeding the reaction to DHSO.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Testing the influence of separate FDR calculation and minimal peptide length</title><p id="P19">Apart from MeroX, all tested search engines allow their users to decide on performing a separate inter-/ intra-crosslink FDR calculation. MeroX calculates FDR of intra- and inter-protein crosslinks as well as dead-end-links in separate groups by default. A separated target-decoy based FDR calculation is considered useful as the group of interprotein (heteromeric) connections is much larger compared to the theoretical intra-protein crosslinks that can form. This might lead to an underestimated error for the group of heteromeric crosslinks if the FDR is estimated on the total set of CSMs. Lenz et al. showed that by calculating the target-decoy based FDR separately, the final FDR of their DSSO dataset was lowered from 36 % to 15 %.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> This is in line with findings from others that found most wrong identifications in the group of interprotein connections especially when using large databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. They estimated the error rate to be in the range of 20 – 25 % false positives within a dataset of 2 % overall FDR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> In contrast to our previously published peptide library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> consisting of peptides from only one protein, the main library of this study contains 842 theoretical inter-protein crosslinks, 100 intra-protein crosslinks and 100 homeotypic crosslinks (link between peptides of the same sequence). The distribution of inter and intra links nicely represent the theoretical distribution of a real protein mix sample (i.e. <italic>E.coli</italic> ribosome). In conclusion we were wondering if the FDR calculation in separate groups does also influence our results using the peptide library. In line with our expectations, all tools suffered from a higher error rate within the group of inter crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>). Interestingly, xiSearch does not show any difference in inter links but a lower FDR for intra links when selecting "ignore groups" (=separate FDR set to off) in xiFDR. Using pLink 2 or MaxLynx the number of crosslinks but also FDR slightly increases when disabling separate FDR calculation. XlinkX predominantly adds wrong crosslinks to its result file upon enabling separate FDR calculation. Enabling or disabling this option does however not influence the result when using Annika. In contrast to our expectations, the separate FDR calculation did not significantly improve overall FDR or ID numbers independently of the search tool used. This might still be reasoned by the nature of our artificial library system that was searched against a database of 171 ribosomal proteins. Hence, peptides of 133 proteins contained in the database are not existent in the sample, leading to a disproportional large number of theoretical vs existing inter-protein crosslinks. Furthermore, the actual number of identified interprotein connections was higher than those of intra-protein links. This corresponds to the expected theoretical distribution but differs from actual real proteome-wide searches where intra-protein links are more abundant. Aiming to further investigate a more complex system we spiked the peptide library into a non-crosslinked background of tryptic HEK peptides (1:5 mass ratio) and analyzed the resulting data again with or without a separate FDR calculation set in each search algorithm. This however led to a very similar result with little to no effect on the final crosslink IDs. Only with XlinkX we now identify 348 instead of 259 correct interprotein links while maintaining the error rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>)</p><p id="P20">Next, we tested the influence of the peptide length of the shorter peptide within a linked pair on result quality. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 B</xref> clearly illustrates that shorter peptides are more prone for wrongly annotated spectra. This fits our expectations as (too) short peptides will generate fewer fragments and therefore yield in less confident identifications. In a large database the chance of sequences from different protein overlapping by chance is furthermore increased with decreased peptide length potentially leading to ambiguous identifications. Based on our data a minimal peptide length of 6 or even 7 seems beneficial, although &gt;100 unique crosslinks are lost when excluding results containing peptides of 6 amino acids length. Of note, our library contains no peptide that has a sequence length of only 5, which is why that group contains exclusively wrong hits.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Influence of increased sample complexity and crosslink enrichment</title><p id="P21">To mimic more realistic conditions – where non-crosslinked linear peptides are way more abundant – we spiked the main library into a tryptic digest of linear HEK peptides at a mass ratio of 1:5. The resulting mixture was analyzed by means of LC-MS/MS and crosslink searches were performed against databases of different sizes, starting with the ribosomal database (171 proteins) that was also used for all other searches and ending with proteome wide searches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 A</xref>). Annika, pLink 2, MaxLynx and xiSearch maintain FDR at levels below 10 % but loose up to 50 % or more of their identifications upon increasing the database size to a proteome wide search. Notably, xiSearch maintained high numbers of unique links for all database sizes at quite low FDR rates. XiSearch therefore clearly outperforms all tested search engines by means of ID numbers and FDR in case of proteome-wide searches. On the downside it consumes high computational power, which is why analysis of more than one raw-file at once did not work out for proteome-wide searches on our computer (IntelXenon CPU@ 2.6 GHz, 128 GB RAM). In contrast, MeroX and XlinkX maintain their identification numbers at a high level at cost of data reliability, leading to very high FDR values of up to 26 %. The database size furthermore influences the minimal score (maximal for pLink 2) accepted as more decoy hits can be found (e.g. Annika increases its accepted minimal score from 120 to 214). As described by Weisbrod and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, the number of redundant sequences within the database increases with increasing size leading to ambiguous crosslink IDs. This cannot be visualized with our peptide library system as a correctly annotated crosslinked peptide is still correct in case its sequence is contained several times in the database. Within our CSMs at 1% target-decoy FDR we did not obtain any protein ID for any database size that was ambiguous. We representatively checked on this issue in Annika without any FDR filter and found a maximum of 6.3 % of all CSMs contained at least one redundant sequence. However, in real samples that need biological interpretation such redundant sequences impede proper annotation of CSMs to the respective protein-protein interaction. When enriching the spiked library by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) we were able to (re-)boost identifications to the level seen without spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 B</xref>) and obtaining the same trends with regards to FDR. We additionally applied post-score cutoffs to the results using the largest database based on the scores that yielded in 1 % experimentally validated FDR in our initial non-spiked measurements (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and that are more stringent than those cutoff values recommended by the authors of the respective search engines. This improves the experimentally validated FDR, that is however still ranging from 2.1 % for pLink 2 to 10.5 % for MeroX in the spiked samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2 A and B</xref>). The database size dependent effects we observed within our spiked samples are furthermore reproducible when analyzing the non-spiked library with the same set of databases, as representatively analyzed with Annika and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2 C</xref>. Our results suggest that the choice of a properly sized database is of high importance for the reliability of the results as well as that post-score cutoffs to minimize effects of improper FDR estimation need to be empirically determined in dependence of used software and complexity of the sample.</p><p id="P22">To check for the performance of affinity-enrichment using the azide tagged linker DSBSO we also spiked the enrichable library, containing no azide-protected lysines, with linear tryptic HEK peptides in mass ratios of 1:10 or 1:100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Enrichment was performed by clicking crosslinked peptides to beads functionalized with dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup></p><p id="P23">The total amount of peptides subjected to MS analysis was kept constant at 1 µg for all injections as this seemed maximal for our LC-MS setting. This means that the 1:100 control sample contains 10 ng cross-linked peptides. For enrichment 20 µg crosslinked peptides were spiked with 200 µg or 2 mg HEK peptides resulting in 1.3 µg total peptides on average, and independent of the spike ratio, in the enriched fraction. Although quite some input material was lost during enrichment, the theoretical input can be freely upscaled to compensate. The resulting enriched samples were of high purity, enabling the injection of close to 1 ug cross-linked material even in samples with high amounts of background (instead of only 10 ng, as in the 1:100 spiked control) and therefore maintaining constantly high crosslink numbers and low FDR values independently of the sample complexity prior to enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Influence of additional FAIMS separation on resulting crosslink identification numbers and properties</title><p id="P24">High-field asymmetric-waveform ion-mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) adds another separation dimension and therefore decreases spectrum complexity and reduces noise. Both effects were reported beneficial for the identification of crosslinked peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> We probed the effect of FAIMS on the here presented synthetic peptide system using DSSO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). In line with the results of Schnirch and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we observe a maximum number of unique crosslinks when using compensation voltages (CV) in the range of -50 to -60V. Furthermore, we observed very high reproducibility when using FAIMS and a trend to lower FDR values upon lowered CV. The combination of 3 CVs within one run boosted our overall identification number to 700 which is a 10 % increase compared to our measurements without FAIMS (numbers from analysis using Annika at 1 % estimated FDR).</p><p id="P25">Next, we investigated if lower injection amounts are sufficient for identification of crosslinks thanks to the improved signal to noise ratios when using FAIMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Without FAIMS, on the HFX 1000 ng were injected for all samples, which was stepwise lowered down to 10 ng on the Exploris with and without FAIMS. Judged from ID numbers, 100 ng, only 1/8 of the maximal amount used, was sufficient to still identify close to 500 unique crosslinks with FAIMS which is ~90% of the identified links using 800 ng input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 A</xref>). Further lowered amounts lead to a drastic decrease of crosslinks. In a direct comparison of data acquired with/without the FAIMS device attached, we see a clear advantage of FAIMS especially for lowered injection amounts based on the number of identified crosslinks. Upon injection of higher peptide input the effect seems to diminish but the number of CSMs found per unique crosslink is still increased by using FAIMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Since our data with FAIMS outperforms those without we focused further investigations on FAIMS data: When comparing retention times of crosslinked peptides IDs, we observed a slight shift towards higher retention times with higher peptide amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 B</xref>). This effect is not reasoned by an overloaded column as the retention time of individual CSMs did not change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8B</xref>), but rather by identifying additional CSMs. When looking into the physicochemical properties of the additionally identified CSMs, a shift in hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 C</xref>) as well as an increase of molecular weights and m/z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 D</xref>) can be observed, which might explain shifted retention times upon increasing input amounts. Furthermore, the relative charge distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 E</xref>) depends on the input amount. The fraction of high charged z = 5 ions is increased, while the fraction of z = 4 charged ions is lowered with higher input. This observation is in line with the seen dependency of molecular weight to input amount as larger peptides are more likely highly charged in an acidic environment. When comparing this charge distribution to those observed without FAIMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 F</xref>) a clear shift from more dominant z = 3 charged ions without FAIMS to predominant z = 4 charged ions with FAIMS can be observed, which is beneficial for the detection of predominantly higher charged crosslinked ions over linear peptides. Of note this effect seems to be dependent on the used instrument type as well, since the relative fraction of +3 charged CSMs is biggest in our data from the HFX. Those results without FAIMS obtained from 25 – 50 ng input contain only a total of 24 and 6 CSMs respectively, which is why the relative results seem not to fit to those results with higher ID numbers. With only 10 ng of input no CSMs were identified at 1% FDR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Benchmarking acquisition strategies</title><p id="P27">We finally investigated the FDR of crosslinks using different MSn acquisition strategies on an Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data analysis was performed using XlinkX at 1 % FDR on CSM and residue pair level.

Therefore, MS3 (acquired as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>) was compared to an MS2-MS2 method (acquired as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>) and our standard stepped HCD acquisition method for the main library crosslinked using DSSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

We however observed a slight increase in FDR (8.5% vs 7.6 and 7.2% for MS3 and MS2-MS2 respectively). Surprisingly, the experimentally validated FDR for MS3 is higher with lower unique residue pair numbers than for the MS2-MS2 method which contrasts with the literature. Although MS3 and MS2-MS2 methods are thought to give advantage for crosslink identification, stepped HCD performed better in our hands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The here presented peptide libraries represent a new and highly flexible standard to benchmark crosslinker reagents of different chemical reactivity as well as for comparison of search engines or acquisition strategies. Thanks to peptide sequences originating from 38 different proteins, the library represents a realistic digest from the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal protein complex, allowing for in-depth analysis of search-engine specific FDR calculation. Our in house developed tool IMP-X-FDR comes with an easy-to-use user interface and allows FDR calculation, comparison of crosslink results across software platforms and investigation of crosslink-properties in an automated manner also for non-bioinformaticians.</p><p id="P29">Our results suggests that additional and empirical score cutoffs are a valuable instrument to correct the actual FDR. The height of this cutoff value is not only software specific but also dependent on database size and sample complexity. Our library helps to find such specific score-cut-off values but also showed that built-in target-decoy based FDR estimation overestimates correct results in case of all tested search engines. Of note, not all tested tools allow to perform their target-decoy based FDR estimation on unique crosslink or even protein-protein interaction level. To give an example, MeroX and pLink 2 do their FDR estimation on spectrum level, leading to false hits propagating during grouping to the final unique crosslinks and higher than expected final experimentally validated FDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We believe, machine learning approaches as well as the inclusion of additional parameters like retention time or ion mobility to (re-)score identifications might improve crosslink numbers and validity of FDR in future algorithms.</p><p id="P30">The most challenging part of data analysis seems to find a good compromise in the trade between high identification numbers and low FDR. In our data, MS Annika and MaxLynx seem to find this optimum best for cleavable crosslinkers, while pLink 2 seems to perform very well for the tested non-cleavable linker. The performance of xiSearch was stable for non-cleavable and cleavable crosslinkers as well as for database sizes up to 5000 proteins and is therefore an allrounder within the crosslink search engines. We however faced troubles in software stability for proteome-wide searches. We further observed that some search engines fit better to specific linker reagents than others leading to an additional linker dependent performance difference that is not caused by the crosslinker chemistry itself but by technical reasons as an altered spectrum complexity for MS cleavable vs non-cleavable reagents. This is even reflected in issues to properly define specific new linker reagents. To give an example, sulfoxy based linkers as DSSO or DSBSO were reported to generate characteristic doublet peaks of two different delta masses upon MS fragmentation thanks to water elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Upon the tested algorithms, MaxLynx and pLink 2 do not allow a definition of more than two fragments and their results might be further improved upon implementation. Another example is Thermos Proteome Discoverer 2.5, were the definition of a fragment mass 0 is impossible but needed for the zero-length linker CDI. As a workaround a very low mass ≥1E<sup>-5</sup>must be defined. This affects search engines as XlinkX or Annika when running as a node within Proteome Discoverer. In line with these observations, it seems that the developers of search engines focus on specific linker types for optimization of their algorithms and this yields in boosted results and better score-based separation of target vs decoy hits for linkers of the exact same chemistry.</p><p id="P31">Many studies aim to minimize error rate and maximize confidence in crosslink results with alternative approaches: The Rappsilber laboratory investigated this issue by separately crosslinking fractions after size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and accepting only those protein-protein interactions as confident that are between proteins of the same SEC fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Another common way to validate crosslink data is by comparison to 3D structures of representative protein complexes in the dataset. Yugandhar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> showed that this approach can lead to a significant underestimation of the actual error rate by implementing additional quality criteria, including the validation of interactions by orthogonal techniques, by known interactions or by adding the proteome of unrelated organisms to the search and checking for misidentifications. In line with our results their results further show, that applying minimal score-cutoffs can drastically reduce error rate and might therefore be highly beneficial to obtain interpretable and confident results. The Bruce lab estimates the error rate for large scale studies by determining the theoretical maximal number of inter- and intra-protein crosslinks based on available 3D structures. They demonstrate that those inter-protein crosslink fractions greater than the theoretical maximum value are most likely occurring from false positive IDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">Complementing these studies, a synthetic library system serves as ground truth model to experimentally validate observed FDR. We believe that a gold standard in the field of crosslinking MS must be established in the future for robust data analysis. Further software updates or novel algorithms will improve the reliability of the results and increase the coverage of crosslink identification.</p><p id="P33">Our data will therefore provide valuable input to benchmark new or updated search engines. The freely available IMP-X-FDR can be easily adopted for automated FDR calculation with any novel crosslink search engine thanks to the open-source code.
