<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) induces strong antibody and T cell responses. Although considered to be localized in the cytosol, we readily detect N on the surface of live cells. N released by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells or N-expressing transfected cells binds to neighboring cells by electrostatic high-affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not other sulfated glycosaminoglycans. N binds with high affinity to 11 human chemokines, including CXCL12β, whose chemotaxis of leukocytes is inhibited by N from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS CoV. Anti-N Abs bound to the surface of N expressing cells activate Fc receptor-expressing cells. Our findings indicate that cell surface N manipulates innate immunity by sequestering chemokines and can be targeted by Fc expressing innate immune cells. This, in combination with its conserved antigenicity among human CoVs, advances its candidacy for vaccines that induce cross-reactive B and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human CoVs, including novel zoonotic strains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Despite the unprecedented expeditious development and deployment of highly effective vaccines, the rapid selection of SARS Coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S) antibody (Ab) escape mutants threatens to delay the return to pre-pandemic conditions. To broaden vaccination and reduce SARS-CoV-2 related acute and chronic disease, it is crucial to improve our knowledge of innate and adaptive immunity to CoVs.</p>
<p id="P3">CoVs encode four major structural proteins. S, membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are localized in the viral surface envelope. N binds to viral RNA through electrostatic interactions, forming cytoplasmic helical nucleocapsids that associate with M to enable virus budding into early secretory compartments. As the most abundantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 protein, N induces strong Ab and T<sub>CD8+</sub> immune responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Although CoV N is widely considered to be strictly localized in the cytoplasm, cell surface expression of RNA viruses N is more the rule than the exception. Early studies with monoclonal Abs (mAbs) reported surface expression of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus N <sup>

<sec id="S3">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 N is robustly expressed on the infected cell surface</title>
<p id="P5">We examined cell surface expression of SARS-CoV-2 N by imaging Vero cells 24 h post-infection (hpi) with wild-type (wt) or a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing eGFP (SARS-CoV-2_eGFP). To exclusively detect cell surface N, we incubated live cells with primary and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies at 4°C prior to fixation and mounting for confocal imaging. This releveled clear surface N staining over mock-infected (mock) background levels, using S or eGFP as markers of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, maximum intensity projection images of z-stack). We similarly found N on the surface of BHK-21_humanACE2(hACE2), Caco-2, Calu-3, CHO-K1_hACE2, and HEK293-FT_hACE2 cells infected with wt or eGFP SARS-CoV-2 at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>). Depending on the cell type, we observed a variable degree of colocalization between N and S, particularly remarkable in Vero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), Calu-3, CHO-K1_hACE2, and HEK293-FT_hACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). We noted a dramatic syncytia formation in hACE2 overexpressing BHK-21_hACE2 and HEK293-FT_hACE2 cells as reported 11</p>
<p id="P6">To measure N surface expression more quantitatively, we performed flow cytometry analyses of live infected cells 24 hpi. Surface N was detected on a subpopulation of S or eGFP expressing cells for each of the seven cell types examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>). N was also detected on the surface of live cells infected with Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Via flow cytometry, we determined the kinetics of N expression on the surface of Vero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c–d</xref>), BHK-21_hACE2, and A549_hACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). As early as 8 hpi, we observed a significant surface signal for N protein in live Vero and BHK-21_hACE2 infected cells, while it took slightly longer (12 hpi) for A549_hACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Notably, depending on cell type and marker of infection (S vs. eGFP) we detected cells expressing N but not S or eGFP on a fraction of cells, ranging from less than 1% to 43% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>). This is consistent with several mechanisms acting alone or in combination: differential expression of SARS-CoV-2 gene products in individual cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, complete retention of S in the secretory pathway <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, and transfer of N from infected to non-infected cells.</p>
<p id="P7">To determine whether N cell surface expression requires other SARS-CoV-2 gene products, we transfected cells with an expression plasmid encoding N. Staining of live BHK-21, CHO-K1 or HEK293-FT cells transfectants revealed up to 7-fold more N mAb binding over background levels obtained with cells transfected with a control plasmid expressing eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). N-surface expression increased between 24 and 72 h post-transfection, providing further evidence for the specificity of staining, and demonstrating that cell surface expression is an intrinsic property of biosynthesized N.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Exogenous N binds to cells</title>
<p id="P8">To examine whether N surface expression requires its synthesis in the cell, we incubated BHK-21, CHO-K1, or HEK293-FT cells with exogenous purified recombinant N (rN) for 15 min at 37 C° resulted in. This resulted in strong flow cytometry staining (2-log shift) with anti-N mAbs relative to control cells incubated with an irrelevant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">N interacts with negatively charged viral RNA through highly positively charged RNA-binding domains<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. We examined charge-based N binding to the cell surface by treating rN coated cells with polybrene, a cationic polymer that neutralizes surface electrostatic charges. Flow cytometric analysis showed that polybrene decreases rN bound to live BHK-21, CHO-K1, and HEK293-FT cells to similar levels, with the magnitude of the effect proportional to the amount of bound N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">For most mammalian cells, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are the major negatively charged molecule on the plasma membrane<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. To assess the contribution of GAGs to N cell surface binding, we used a panel of GAG-deficient CHO cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Each of the GAG-deficient cell lines tested failed to bind rN over levels observed with recombinant GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The panel included cells with complete absence of GAGs (CHO-pgsA-745, HO-pgsB-618), and cells with defects in synthesizing heparan sulfate and heparin but no other GAGs (CHO-pgsD-677, CHO-pgsE-606). Consistent with these findings, treating Vero, BHK-21, CHO-K1, or HEK293-FT cells with heparinase I, II, and III in combination, to depolymerize heparan sulfate/heparin polysaccharide chains to disaccharides, cells dramatically reduced binding of exogenous rN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). We directly confirmed N binding to heparin by using biolayer interferometry (BLI), where we directly demonstrate N specific nanomolar affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not to other sulfated GAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6d, e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Together, these findings indicate that N binds to the cell surface by interacting with heparan sulfate and heparin in a charge-dependent manner.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>N is transferred from expressing to non-expressing cells</title>
<p id="P12">In SARS-CoV-2 24 hpi immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>), we observed cells expressing N but not S or GFP as early as 8 and 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>), with increasing numbers of cells over time after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). To determine whether N can be transferred from infected to non-infected cells, we added SARS-CoV-2 to a co-culture of infectable (hACE2 expressing) and non-infectable (non-hACE2 expressing) CHO-K1 cells (we confirmed that hACE2 is required for infecting CHO cells with SARS-CoV-2, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We pre-stained non-infectable cells with CellTrace™ Violet to enable unambiguous flow identification after co-culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Remarkably, co-cultured non-ACE2 expressing uninfected CHO-K1 cells (also confirmed by the absence of S expression) have a higher cell surface N signal than infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). N transfer from infected cells required GAG expression on uninfected cells, as shown by near background staining by GAG-deficient CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d, e</xref>). N is also transferred from HEK293-FT or BHK-21 cells transiently expressing N from a transgene to co-cultured un-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Based on these findings, we conclude that N protein synthesis leads to its release from cells and its robust transfer to non-synthesizing cells, where it is retained by binding heparin/heparan sulfate.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 N inhibits chemokine function but enables Ab based immune cell activation</title>
<p id="P14">The robust expression of N on the surface of infected and surrounding cells suggests a significant evolutionary function. SARS-CoV-2, like most viruses, induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by infected cells. Could N interfere with this signaling? We examined the ability of immobilized N to interact with 64 human cytokines by BLI. Remarkably N bound CCL5, CCL11, CCL21, CCL26, CCL28, CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12β, and CXCL14 chemokines with micromolar to nanomolar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). By contrast, none of the other SARS-CoV-2 immobilized structural (S, M, E) or non-structural (ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, and 10) proteins tested interacted with any of the cytokines in the panel with affinities higher than that observed for immobilized GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Kinetic curves of N binding to each chemokine were biphasic, deviating from first-order binding (1:1) and consistent with heterogeneous binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Chemokine function is based on interaction with both surface GAGs and their specific receptors located in the surface of leukocytes. We found that blocking the GAG-binding domain of chemokines by increasing concentrations of heparan sulfate (from bovine kidney) and chondroitin sulfate A and B, N binding to its subset of chemokines was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). This indicates that N binds to chemokines through their GAG-binding domain.</p>
<p id="P16">What is the functional relevance of N-chemokine interactions? Transwell chemotaxis experiments with monocyte-like cells (MonoMac-1), T lymphocyte-like cells (MOLT-4), and human healthy donor PBMCs revealed that rN blocked CXCL12β-induced chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). While rN from different vendors showed comparable results inhibiting CXCL12β-mediated induction of migration of MonoMac-1 cells, the S1 protein (subunit 1 of the S protein, containing the receptor-binding domain) had no inhibitory effect on CXCL12β-induced chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Extending these findings, rN from both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also inhibited CXCL12β induced migration of MonoMac-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">mAbs to mouse CoV N have been reported to exert anti-viral activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (with complement) and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. To examine their potential as a target for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), we used FcγRIIIa receptor-expressing Jurkat reporter cells as a surrogate for ADCC effector cell recognition of anti-N mAb coated SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Vero and BHK-21_hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infected cells activated reporter cells in an anti-N mAb concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Activation was not observed in the absence of infection or with a control human mAb with the same heavy chain.</p>
<p id="P18">Taken together, these findings indicate that N protein from each of the highly pathogenic human CoVs blocks chemokine function. This is consistent with the possibility that cell surface N blocks chemokine function <italic>in vivo</italic>, facilitating viral replication and transmission. Conversely, we also show that cell surface N is a potential target for ADCC, which potentially contributes to limiting viral replication and transmission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">Here, we show that N synthesized during SARS-CoV-2 infection or from a transfected cDNA is expressed on the surface of both N synthesizing cells and neighboring cells. N binding to the cell surface is based on specific association with heparan sulfate and heparin. The most parsimonious explanation for these findings is that N is released from cells and binds to both producing and bystander cells from liquid phase. Remarkably, based on the flow cytometry, levels of N on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells equals or exceeds cell surface S on all but one of the seven cell types examined. This, in part is due to the retention of a substantial fraction of S in the early secretory pathway but also reflects a robust amount of cell surface N, likely in the range of 10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>-10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> copies per cell.</p>
<p id="P20">The mechanism underlying N secretion remains to be established. N has two potential sites for addition of N-linked oligosaccharides in the secretory pathway that are glycosylated and readily detected when N is targeted to the ER with an artificial N-terminal signal sequence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Without a signal sequence, N is not glycosylated. This indicates that, as with other viral nucleic acid-binding proteins (<italic>e.g.,</italic> SV40 T antigen, influenza virus N), SARS-CoV-2 N is likely secreted through a non-canonical secretory pathway, possibly one of the three defined pathways that bypass insertion into the ER<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, like N, several proteins non-canonically exported to the cell surface (HIV Tat, FGF2, and tau) bind heparan sulfate, which has been shown to be involved in traversing the plasma membrane<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. It will be interesting to examine the extent to which cell surface export of N and other viral RNA binding proteins, as well as their cell surface binding, is based on heparan sulfate association.</p>
<p id="P21">N is typically the most abundantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 protein, and its transfer to non-infected cells potentially amplifies its contributions to viral fitness. The remarkable ability of cell surface N to bind chemokines and block chemotaxis of immune effector cells offers an evolutionary explanation for its cellular export and binding to infected and neighboring uninfected cells. Like N, chemokines are immobilized on source cells and their neighbors by binding to GAGs. A number of viruses are known to express chemokine-binding proteins, which modulate chemokine activity by interacting with the GAG- or receptor-binding domain of chemokines, or both <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Our findings establish SARS-CoV-2 N as the first CoV chemokine binding protein, one with a remarkably high affinity (nanomolar range) for multiple chemokines.</p>
<p id="P22">The binding of N to heparin, which limits coagulation at inflammation sites, suggests a possible role for secreted N in promoting COVID-associated clotting abnormalities. N is present in intestine and lungs from recovered and fatal COVID-19 patients, respectively, while virus-like particles are rarely detected<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, consistent with this intriguing possibility as well as a role in the chronic low level inflammation that causes “long COVID-19” symptoms.</p>
<p id="P23">The remarkable efficacy of spike only-vaccines demonstrates that antibodies to N are not required for COVID-19 protection. SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust anti-N Ab response, in part likely due to cross-reaction with memory B cells induced by seasonal CoV infections. These Abs may reduce SARS-CoV-2 disease in naïve individuals since we establish N as a potential target for antibody-mediated effector functions, including complement and NK cell-mediated lysis of infected cells. Abs, therefore may play an unexpected role in protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection afforded by immunization with N-expressing vectors presumed to function via induction of N-specific T cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. N is an attractive vaccine target due to its strong immunogenicity and much lower antigenic drift than spike. This may be particularly relevant given the remarkable capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to acquire amino changes in S as illustrated by the recent introduction of the omicron variant with over thirty non-synonymous mutations in S.</p>
<p id="P24">In summary, our findings demonstrate unexpected roles for N in innate and adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and other human CoVs that may contribute to both pathogenesis and protection, and support N as an Ab and T cell target for future “universal” vaccines that provide broad protection against both future strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other human CoVs.</p>

Migrated cells from the top chamber were detected in the lower chamber at the end of the experiment. The induction of migration shows means +/- SEM (n = 3) from one representative assay performed in triplicate out of at least three independent assays.

ADCC reporter bioassays were performed on SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero and BHK-21_hACE2 target cells (24 hpi, MOI =1) using decreasing concentrations of a human mAb against the N protein and Jurkat effector reporter cells. After overnight incubation, luciferase expression to gauge cell activation was measured. Data show mean +/- SEM (n = 3) of one representative assay out of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Dashed lines show background signal detected in the absence of Ab.</p>
