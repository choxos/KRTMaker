Introducing novel genes and alleles from wheat’s wild relatives into the wheat breeding pool via introgression lines is an important component of overcoming this low variation but is constrained by poor genomic resolution and limited understanding of the genomic impact of introgression breeding programmes. By sequencing 17 hexaploid wheat/<italic>Ambylopyrum muticum</italic> introgression lines and the parent lines, we have precisely pinpointed the borders of introgressed segments, most of which occur within genes. We report a genome assembly and annotation of <italic>Am. muticum</italic> that has facilitated the identification of <italic>Am. muticum</italic> resistance genes commonly introgressed in lines resistant to stripe rust. Our analysis has identified an abundance of structural disruption and homoeologous pairing across the introgression lines, likely caused by the suppressed <italic>Ph1</italic> locus. mRNAseq analysis of six of these introgression lines revealed that novel introgressed genes are rarely expressed and those that directly replace a wheat orthologue have a tendency towards downregulation, with no discernible compensation in the expression of homoeologous copies. This study explores the genomic impact of introgression breeding and provides a schematic that can be followed to characterise introgression lines and identify segments and candidate genes underlying the phenotype. This will facilitate more effective utilisation of introgression pre-breeding material in wheat breeding programmes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. (bread wheat) is a vital crop, providing around 20% of calories and 25% of protein consumed globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>). Improvements to wheat since the late 19th century have largely come from conventional breeding strategies, but these improvements rely on ample genetic variation in the primary gene pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hao et al., 2020</xref>). The hexaploid bread wheat grown today derives from just one or two polyploidisation events ˜10,000 years ago between the tetraploid <italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> and the diploid <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Charmet, 2011</xref>). The limited diversity stemming from this genetic bottleneck has been compounded over time by intensive breeding. Pressure on breeders to prioritise advanced breeding material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">J. Valkoun, 2001</xref>) for more rapid development of uniform, high quality varieties has limited the introduction of genetic variation from external sources. The genetic variation that does exist in modern wheat material is rapidly being exhausted, evident in plateauing yield improvements that left unchecked, will be insufficient to meet global demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ray et al., 2013</xref>). Wild relative introgression breeding will be a major component of overcoming this genetic constraint in the years to come, enabling breeders to access the secondary and tertiary gene pools of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">J. Valkoun, 2001</xref>) and incorporate novel alleles or genes into modern breeding material.</p><p id="P3">There are many examples of the successful transfer of wild relative genes into wheat since first pioneered by E.R. Sears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Doussinault et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fatih, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Friebe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klindworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sears, 1956</xref>). However, challenges associated with the high-throughput production and verification of introgression lines, in addition to the linkage drag of introgressed segments, has limited the widespread adoption of introgression breeding. Utilising recombination mutants and high-throughput marker methods, introgressing entire wild relative genomes into wheat as stably inherited, homozygous segments is now possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">King et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2017</xref>). These sets of lines provide the raw material required for the incorporation of alien variation into breeding programmes. Segments in these lines that confer phenotypes of interest can be identified. Lines with overlapping segments can then be crossed to break down large segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Khazan et al., 2020</xref>), resulting in genes of interest captured in short introgressed segments with reduced linkage drag, ready to be deployed in breeding programmes.</p><p id="P4">Identifying the introgressed content of each introgression line is important for the effective utilisation of these lines. Insufficient marker density for genotyping approaches such as Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) and low resolution of genomic <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (GISH) limits the resolution at which segments can be identified. Determining the precise size and positions of segments and refining positions of overlap between introgression lines is important when relating to phenotypic data to narrow down regions containing genes of interest. Identifying introgression boundaries at a higher resolution will allow lines with overlapping segments to be identified; these can be crossed to break down segments and capture genes of interest in smaller segments with reduced linkage drag.</p><p id="P5">Wild relative genes have undergone selection in a different environment to the agricultural setting in which elite wheat lines are selected and thus may be deleterious, or be, at the very least imperfect replacements of their wheat orthologue when deployed in field conditions. Therefore, many genes introgressed along with a gene of interest will contribute to reduced agronomic performance of a line. This reduced performance will be driven by differences both in the encoded protein and in the pattern of expression of the introgressed gene compared to the wheat orthologue it replaced. In addition to these direct changes to gene expression caused by introgression, disruptions to established regulatory networks and the resulting indirect effects on the expression of wheat genes in the genomic background will likely contribute to altered performance.</p><p id="P6">Ordinarily, hexaploid wheat behaves as a diploid during meiosis. The <italic>Pairing Homoeologous 1</italic> (<italic>Ph1</italic>) locus is largely responsible for this behaviour, restricting synapsis and crossovers to homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rey et al., 2017</xref>). A suppressed or deleted <italic>Ph1</italic> locus enables recombination between wheat chromosomes and non-homologous wild relative chromosomes and is a major tool used to transfer wild relative genes into wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martín et al., 2017</xref>). However, this also enables homoeologous chromosomes to pair and recombine leading to transmission of chromatin between the subgenomes of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koo et al., 2020</xref>) and deletions/duplications where synteny between homoeologous chromosomes breaks.</p><p id="P7">Here, we have conducted a high-resolution genomic analysis on 17 <italic>Am muticum</italic>/hexaploid wheat introgression lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">King et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2017</xref>), utilising whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the introgression lines and the parent lines and a draft genome assembly of <italic>Amblyopyrum muticum</italic> [(Boiss.) Eig.; <italic>Aegilops mutica</italic> Boiss; 2n=2X=14; genome TT], a wild relative of wheat belonging to its tertiary gene pool. Phenotypic screening of <italic>Am. muticum</italic> introgression lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fellers et al., 2020</xref>) has revealed resistances to leaf, stem and stripe rust not observed in the parental wheat lines and thus likely conferred by introgressed genes. KASP genotyping to identify segments has been conducted on many of these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grewal et al., 2021</xref>). Through this analysis, we have pinpointed introgression segment junctions to a higher resolution than previously possible, in many cases within a single pair of reads, demonstrating segments of variable size that overlap between introgression lines, which explains some differences in resistance phenotype seen between lines. These overlaps will enable these segments to be further broken down by crossing introgression lines together. Using <italic>in silico</italic> karyotyping, we have shown that large-scale structural disruption is ubiquitous across the lines, including deletions and duplications up to whole-chromosome size and homoeologous recombination likely facilitated by <italic>Ph1</italic> suppression. A genome assembly and gene annotation of <italic>Am. muticum</italic> has enabled us to identify introgressed resistance genes in stripe, stem and leaf rust resistant lines that may represent novel resistance conferred by <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes. Analysis of gene expression of six introgression lines compared to the wheat parent lines has revealed that novel introgressed genes are less likely to be expressed than introgressed genes replacing an orthologue. Introgressed genes directly replacing a wheat orthologue show a tendency to be downregulated, with no significant balancing of the homoeologous copies in the remaining subgenomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Whole genome sequencing facilitates high resolution introgression detection</title><p id="P8">To reveal <italic>Am. muticum</italic> segments within introgression lines using WGS data, we developed a workflow that utilises mapping coverage and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information from the introgression line and the wheat parents. If a wheat segment is replaced by an <italic>Am. muticum</italic> segment the mapping coverage will drop in that region due to structural variation and breaks in synteny between wheat and <italic>Am. muticum</italic>. Due to the homozygous nature of the lines, homozygous muticum-specific SNPs are indicative of the site of introgression. Reads derived from an introgressed segment that aberrantly map to a non-introgressed region will map at the same position as the wheat reads coming from that region and result in heterozygous SNP calls with muticum-specific and wheat-specific alleles found at the same position. Therefore, to locate introgressions, we searched for genomic blocks with reduced mapping coverage, homozygous <italic>Am. muticum</italic>-specific SNPs and few heterozygous <italic>Am. muticum</italic>-specific SNPs. We identified introgressions using 1Mbp genomic windows and then defined the borders to a higher resolution using 100Kbp genomic windows. This was performed on 17 double haploid (DH) or backcrossed (BC) <italic>Am. muticum</italic> introgression lines from which Illumina paired-end short reads were produced to an average depth of around 5x. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows an example of this macro-level visualisation of introgression line DH65, which has a 51.29Mbp segment on the telomere of the short arm of chr4D, and a 139.6Mbp monosomic deletion on the short arm of chr5B. Macro-level genome plots for all lines can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>.</p><p id="P9">Using this approach, we confirm the existence of 100% of segments previously identified with KASP genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grewal et al., 2021</xref>). However, we were able to resolve the locations of segment junctions to a much higher resolution than previous methods, due to the limited marker density available for KASP genotyping and the inability of GISH to resolve segments below ˜20Mbp. In addition, we were able to uncover two previously unreported segments that have been subsequently validated by KASP genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grewal et al., 2021</xref>); a 17.39Mbp on the telomere of chr7D of DH195 and a 22.68Mbp segment on the telomere of chr5D in DH121. We also identified a new 3.99Mbp segment on chr6D of DH15 that we subsequently validated using 2 KASP markers, WRC1873 and WRC1890 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). All precise segment positions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">To explore junction regions of segments in fine detail, we used the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>), an interactive browser that allows sequencing reads mapped to a genome within a specified interval to be manually interrogated. Using IGV to explore the junction regions, we were able to precisely identify 33/42 segment ends (78.6%). As some segment ends are telomere substitutions as opposed to crossovers and some segments are derived from the same initial cross, we just looked at uniquely-derived crossover junctions and found that we could identify the precise crossover point between wheat and <italic>Am. muticum</italic> in 12/17 (70.6%) cases. Of the remaining junctions, two were narrowed down to within 100kbp and three had complex structures with duplication events that prohibited precise localisation. Out of the 12 high resolution junctions, 11 (91.7%) were within 670bp upstream or downstream of a wheat gene, with 8 falling within the gene body itself, suggesting that crossovers may be localised to genes. The remaining junction was 6.75Kbp downstream from the nearest gene.</p><p id="P11">For line DH65, the pinpointed junction was validated with Oxford Nanopore long reads mapped to RefSeq v1.0 along with the Illumina paired-end short reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1B</xref>). Oxford Nanopore reads spanned the breakpoint between <italic>Am. muticum</italic> and wheat at the right-hand side of the 51.6Mbp chr4D segment, adding confidence to the identification from Illumina reads alone. We assembled these mapped Oxford Nanopore reads using wtdbg2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ruan and Li, 2020</xref>) with relaxed parameters to include reads that were clipped due to high divergence between wheat and <italic>Am. muticum</italic>, producing a contig that spans the junction. This contig spans the entire junction, including regions to which neither the Illumina reads from <italic>Am. muticum</italic> nor DH65 map. These regions appear to have elevated SNP density, explaining the gaps in mapping.</p><p id="P12">For introgression lines with KASP genotyping verification, WGS data may offer an affordable tool to aid breeders to identify precise location and size of these segments. To assess the sequencing depth requirements and locate the position and size of introgressed segments using coverage deviation alone, we downsampled the Illumina paired-end short reads from 2 lines for which we have identified very precise positions of the junction borders; DH65, and DH92, to 1x, 0.1x, 0.01x and 0.001x to choose the lowest depth at which we could still resolve segment position. 0.01x was the lowest depth that still provided comparable resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Introgression breeding process induces homoeologous pairing and large chromosomal aberrations</title><p id="P13">In addition to introgression sites, we have identified large deletions and duplications, many of which were whole arm or whole chromosome in scale, based on the deviations in mapping coverage not attributable to introgressions. Within the 17 lines examined, 12 lines (70.6%) have one or more very large chromosomal aberrations exceeding 140Mbp. These include: duplication of most of chr1A with a deletion of the homoeologous region of chr1B in DH pair DH124+DH355 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2A</xref>); deletion of the short arm of chr4A in DH86 and deletion of the long arm of chr4B in its DH pair, DH92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2B</xref>); monosomic deletion of most of the short arm of chr5D in DH121 and DH65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2C</xref>), which are not a DH pair, indicating that this event has occurred multiple times at the same position; and a monosomic deletion of chr1A in DH195 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Homoeologous translocations resulting in the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic material can be detected through mapping coverage deviation, indicated by a duplication and deletion in corresponding homoeologous regions. We can also use differences within a double haploid (DH) pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>) to infer what genetic events must have taken place to give rise to the segregation patterns we see from DH lines derived from the same BC3 line. We see evidence of homoeologous pairing both from duplicated/deleted pairs of chromosomes, such as in DH355 and DH124 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2A</xref>) and from corresponding deletions/duplications at homoeologous positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2F</xref>). In BC2F420 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2F</xref>), recombination has taken place between chr5A and chr5D and chr5B has been deleted.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genome assembly and annotation of <italic>Am. muticum</italic>:</title><p id="P15">To facilitate identification of introgressed genes both for differential expression analysis and to find candidate introgressed resistance genes, we produced a draft genome assembly for <italic>Am. muticum</italic> 2130012 comprising most of the gene space. After polishing with long and short reads and resolving haplotigs, the assembly comprised 96,256 contigs and was 2.53Gbp in length, with an N50 of 75.5Kbp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S5</xref>). We estimated the size of the <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genome through two independent methods: mapping the Oxford Nanopore reads back to the assembly and computing coverage across single-copy genes; and based on k-mer counts within the Illumina paired-end reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4</xref>). These resulted in estimates of 4.90Gbp and 4.57Gbp, respectively, compared to flow cytometry estimate of 6.174Gbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pellicer and Leitch, 2020</xref>). Although the genome spans just 53.4% of the estimated genome size (mean of our two independent estimates), BUSCO analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) revealed that 94.2% of the expected gene space was assembled unfragmented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Gene annotation using evidence from root and shoot transcriptomic data, proteomic data, and ab initio predictions resulted in 86841 gene models, 32385 of which were designated as high confidence (HC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). 28995 (89.8%) of the HC genes were assigned functional annotation.</p><p id="P16">To identify <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes not present in wheat and gene families that have undergone expansion in <italic>Am. muticum</italic>, both of which could be contributing novel variation in introgression lines, we used OrthoFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>) to construct 31616 orthogroups from the proteins encoded by the HC genes from <italic>Am. muticum</italic>, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, <italic>Triticum urartu</italic>, <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Enrichment analysis of GO Slim terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

RNA reads were mapped to a pseudo genome (ABDT) constructed by concatenating the wheat reference genome, RefSeq v1.0, with the draft <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genome assembly; this allows us to distinguish between RNA deriving from wheat genes and from <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes in the same way that we can distinguish between wheat homoeologues.</p><p id="P18">Across all six lines, 1750/4989 (35.1%) introgressed genes were expressed. Splitting the introgressed genes into those with an orthologue in wheat and those that are novel revealed that while 1627/3691 (44.1%) introgressed genes with a wheat orthologue were expressed, only 123/1298 (9.48%) novel introgressed genes were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3A</xref>). For introgressed genes that do have a wheat orthologue, those that are more diverged from the orthologue are less likely to be expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3B</xref>), ranging from 21.5% of genes with no wheat orthologue &gt;90% protein identity being expressed, to 64.8% of genes with an orthologue in wheat with &gt;= 99% protein identity being expressed.</p><p id="P19">To test whether <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes that have directly replaced a wheat orthologue are expressed differently to that orthologue, we called differential expression between each introgression line and the wheat parent lines using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Love et al., 2014</xref>) after summing the expression count of each replaced wheat gene with that of its introgressed <italic>Am. muticum</italic> orthologue. Between 13.3% and 23.1% (mean of 19.3% across all lines) of introgressed genes were called as differentially expressed (abs(log<sub>2</sub>FC) &gt;= 1 and adj. p-value &lt;= 0.05 in both parental comparisons) when compared to the expression in the parent lines of the wheat orthologue they replaced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3C</xref>). Between 54.5% and 87.8% (mean of 69.8% across the lines) of these differentially expressed introgressed genes were downregulated in the introgression line.</p><p id="P20">We hypothesised that suppression of wheat genes in an introgressed or deleted region would lead to a change in the expression of homoeologous copies of that gene in the other subgenomes to compensate for the loss of expression. The results of multiple approaches support a lack of overall rebalancing of triad expression following suppression of one of the copies, both in the 400Mbp introgressed region on chr5D of BC3F45 and in the deletion of chr7D in DH161 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4</xref>). In triads where the D homoeologue has been replaced by a <italic>Am.</italic> muticum gene or been deleted, there is an overall reduction in expression on the D homoeologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4A iii and 4B iii</xref>), though to a much lesser degree in the introgression where introgressed <italic>Am. muticum</italic> orthologues are being expressed. In the introgression, there were 74 triads with the D homoeologue introgressed and called as downregulated; none of these triads had any homoeologues called as upregulated. This was compared to 10953 control triads, where no homoeologues are introgressed or deleted and the D homoeologue is not differentially expressed, of which 17 (0.155 %) triads had the A or B homoeologue upregulated. For the deletion, out of 1294 triads with the D homoeologue deleted and therefore not expressed, just 6 triads had one or more homoeologues upregulated (0.464%); this compares to 37 (0.369%) out of 10031 control triads having the A or B homoeologue upregulated. These differences are not significant (Fisher’s exact test two-tailed p-values of 1.00 and 0.628, respectively).</p><p id="P21">To complement the above approach and consider homoeologues whose expression may have changed but not sufficiently to be called as significant by DESeq2, we looked at the log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) in DESeq2 normalised expression counts. Plotting the log<sub>2</sub>FC of DESeq2 normalised expression counts in 10Mbp windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4A i and 4B i</xref>) across the chromosomes illustrates the overall stability of expression in homoeologous regions of introgressions and deletions. For the introgression and the deletion, we compared the log<sub>2</sub>FC of the A and B homoeologues of triads where the D homoeologue had been introgressed or deleted with the log<sub>2</sub> FC of the A and B homoeologues of a control set of triads defined as above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Between 0.181% and 2.40% (106-1261 genes; mean of 0.860% across lines) of these wheat genes were differentially expressed compared to the wheat parents. To assess whether any specific gene functions were enriched in the differentially expressed genes we looked for enriched GO Terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8</xref>). We found some terms to be enriched, suggesting a non-stochastic impact on background transcription, however differences between lines suggests that the nature of the impact on background transcription depends on the genes introgressed/disrupted elsewhere in the genome. Some terms are enriched in more than 3 lines, suggesting these are commonly affected. These are oxidoreductase activity, oxidation-reduction process, tetrapyrrole binding, catalytic activity, carbohydrate metabolic process, cofactor binding, which are enriched in downregulated genes; and ion binding, hydrolase activity, and catalytic activity, which are enriched in upregulated background genes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identifying candidate introgressed genes underlying <italic>Am. muticum</italic> derived rust resistance</title><p id="P23">Two of the lines that we sequenced, DH92 and DH121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig. 5A</xref>), have complete resistance at the seedling stage to Kansas isolates of <italic>Puccinia striiformis tritici</italic> (stripe/yellow rust) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fellers et al., 2020</xref>).

We observe this with the new chr6D segment, the small chr7D segment in DH195 and chr5D segment in DH121, the latter two of which are sources of novel disease resistance.</p><p id="P27">We have demonstrated how whole genome sequencing data can be used to define introgressions to a very high resolution as well as resolve large-scale structural changes in these lines. Downsampling has shown that if we don’t require SNP information, only 0.01x sequencing coverage is required to pinpoint the junctions of known introgressed segments to a comparable resolution. Overlaying this information with KASP genotyping will undoubtedly provide an affordable method to characterise sets of synthetic introgression lines more accurately and comprehensively.</p><p id="P28">Introgressed segments nested within complex genomic structures, such as in DH202 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Some introgression segment boundaries, such as the left-hand border of chr2A in DH15, can be identified but are difficult to pinpoint precisely due to structural complexities around the junction. Therefore, caution is advised when relying on introgression assignments provided by WGS data alone, particularly for complex lines with several large introgressions/deletions/duplications. However, for most lines, where genomic structure is simpler, this approach is robust, and is nevertheless an improvement on lower resolution methods, even if only to identify confounding structural complexities that would otherwise have been missed.</p><p id="P29">We have found that crossover points between wheat and <italic>Am. muticum</italic> mostly take place within or adjacent to genes. Previous work has shown crossovers between wheat and wild relatives are enriched in gene rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nyine et al., 2020</xref>), which mirrors recombination rates along the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gardiner et al., 2019</xref>). Here we have achieved sufficient resolution to reveal these wild relative crossovers are taking place not only in regions of open chromatin and increased recombination rate, but within the genes themselves. Interestingly, this follows the same pattern previously identified for crossovers between homoeologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), in contrast to homologous crossovers which, while enriched in subtelomeric regions and at recombination hotspot motifs, are not specifically enriched in and adjacent to gene bodies.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Genomic instability generated through introgression breeding programme</title><p id="P30">We have illustrated that structural disruption is common in introgression pre-breeding material, including homoeologous pairing and recombination, and duplications and deletions up to chromosome size.

For introgression lines conferring specific phenotypes of interest, it may be important to remove the chromosomal aberrations through further backcrossing, or to characterise which wheat genes have been deleted or duplicated as these may have large effects on phenotype.</p><p id="P31">Smaller scale variation in mapping coverage suggests there is structural variation taking place that we can’t accurately assess with our available data, such as transposable element mobilisation. It will be important to assess the nature and extent of such variation in the future. Unfortunately, structural variation between available chromosome-level genome assemblies and Paragon/Pavon76 is too great for structural variants arising from genome shock to be distinguished from existing structural variation between the cultivars. To study this type of variation, we will need genome assemblies of an introgression line and the wheat parents used in the cross, or a genome assembly of the wheat parent and long read data from the introgression line.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Identification of novel introgressed genes and gene expression profile of introgression lines</title><p id="P32">We identified 3873 novel <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes that could underlie novel traits to introduce into wheat. The gene expression analysis revealed that in the introgression lines, these novel genes are much less likely to be expressed than introgressed genes with an orthologue in wheat. For introgressed genes that do have an orthologue in wheat, there is a further relationship between level of divergence and likelihood of being expressed. This may reflect a lack of required regulatory elements or less efficient transcription factor binding due to divergence between the <italic>Am. muticum</italic> and wheat genes. However, some of this relationship could be driven by the confounding effect of more conserved genes having more core functions and therefore being more constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Luna and Chain, 2021</xref>). It will be important to explore this further to begin to determine whether traits identified in wild relatives may present differently when introgressed into wheat.</p><p id="P33">Many of the introgressed genes are differentially expressed compared to the wheat orthologue replaced, far exceeding the proportion of wheat genes in the background that are differentially expressed. This makes sense biologically due to the different genomic background the <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes have been placed in. Two previous studies have explored the expression of genes in wheat introgression lines with barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rey et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Aegilops longissima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dong et al., 2020</xref>) introgressed. Due to the differences in methods used for different studies, it is difficult to compare the total proportion of DEGs. However, both previous studies also show that many introgressed genes are differentially expressed with most of these being downregulated or silenced. Despite the elevated levels of differential expression among introgressed orthologues, it is important to note that the majority of introgressed genes replacing a direct orthologue were not differentially expressed, suggesting a remarkable similarity in expression compared to the replaced gene in the majority of cases.</p><p id="P34">We didn’t see significant change in homoeologue expression in response to introgression or deletion events. This is line with previous results showing a lack of compensation in homoeologue expression following aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This lack of response suggests that if large-scale balancing of triad expression does take place, it must require selection pressure, which these synthetic lines lack. Now that genome assemblies are available for wheat cultivars possessing many wild relatives introgressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Walkowiak et al., 2020</xref>) that have undergone extensive artificial selection in a wheat background, it will be interesting to analyse how these introgressed regions are expressed and whether balancing of triad expression arises after a period of selection.</p><p id="P35">We see some commonly enriched GO Terms in the genomic background that may be linked with cellular stress or loss of cellular homeostasis; this conclusion is supported by conclusions drawn in the wheat/barley introgression line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rey et al., 2018</xref>).

We identified the probable region of stripe rust resistance in DH92 and DH121 as being within the 22.68Mbp overlapping region of the chr5D segment. The small size and telomeric position of this segment makes it conducive for use in breeding. Within this region, we have identified candidate resistance genes, including 3 novel NLRs and 3 novel LRR Pkinase proteins. We didn’t find evidence for other classes of resistance genes that have been cloned for stripe rust resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>) uniquely introgressed in these lines. The DH92 resistance to leaf rust that is not shared with DH121, is only seen in adult plants and to a composite of isolates; this race non-specific APR tends to be more durable and, in combination with the small segment size, makes this resistance another good target for further characterisation. We identified 3 WAKs and 3 protein kinases uniquely introgressed in DH92. Wall-associated kinases have previously been shown to confer resistance to leaf rust that looks similar to APR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dmochowska-Boguta et al., 2020</xref>) and protein kinase proteins, such as Yr36, have been implicated in APR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ellis et al., 2014</xref>).

Genes with mean TPM greater than 1.0 were classified as expressed.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p id="P52">For each wheat gene in a region identified as introgressed, they were either removed if not in an orthologue pair with an introgressed <italic>Am. muticum</italic> gene or their expression count was summed with that of its <italic>Am. muticum</italic> orthologue. Differential expression analysis between each introgression line and its two wheat parents was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Love et al., 2014</xref>). A gene was classified as differentially expressed if it had an adjusted p-value below 0.05 and an absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;= 1 in both parental comparisons. Differentially expressed genes were partitioned into those in introgressed regions, and in the unaffected wheat background where coverage deviation is between 0.8 and 1.2.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Testing triad expression balancing</title><p id="P53">To examine whether genes belonging to triads that have homoeologues that have been replaced by a <italic>Am. muticum</italic> gene or have been deleted, we took a test set of triads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ramírez-González et al., 2018</xref>) that satisfied the following conditions: the D copy is introgressed or deleted and called as downregulated; the A and B homoeologues are in normal copy number regions (coverage deviation between 0.8 and 1.2); and all homoeologues have normalised expression count across samples &gt;= 1. These were compared to control sets of triads that satisfied the same conditions except the D homoeologue was within a normal copy number region and was not called as differentially expressed. These sets were used for both the comparison of number of triads with A and/or B homoeologue upregulated and for the comparisons of the mean log<sub>2</sub>FC of the A and B homoeologues between the test and control sample of triads. The significance of these comparisons was tested using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test and two-tailed t test, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>GO Term analysis</title><p id="P54">We transferred functional GO Term annotation from genes in the RefSeq v1.0 annotation to genes in the RefSeq v1.1 annotation if they shared greater that 99% similarity across greater than 90.0% of their length. Statistically enriched GO Terms within the differentially expressed background gene set were computed using the R package topGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2020</xref>) with the following parameters: nodeSize=10; classicFisher test p &lt; 0.05 and algorithm=“parentchild”. Enrichment for GO Terms involved in biological processes was tested against all background genes that fall within windows with mapping coverage deviation between 0.8 and 1.2. For novel <italic>Am. muticum</italic> genes, GO terms were extracted from the eggnog functional annotation and converted to GO Slim terms using owltools Map2Slim (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools">https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools</ext-link>).

Resistance genes were manually checked using IGV to identify candidates with even sequencing coverage across the genes in DH92 and DH121 only, in the case of the shared stripe rust resistance, and across the genes in DH92 only, in the case of the DH92-specific leaf and stem rust resistance. To reduce the number of genes to manually check, we removed any genes with less than 2x mean mapping coverage across their length in either DH92 or DH121. The gene models were manually curated using the available evidence. For NLRs revealed by NLRAnnotator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Steuernagel et al., 2020</xref>) with no gene model but transcriptomic and <italic>ab initio</italic> evidence, gene models were manually constructed. The novelty of the uniquely introgressed NLRs was tested by extracting the NB-ARC domains using hmmscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) and aligning them using blastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) to the proteins of HC genes from 10 wheat cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Walkowiak et al., 2020</xref>). Hits below 85% identity were considered novel. The novelty of the other protein types was tested by aligning the whole amino acid sequence to the same protein set; here, hits below &lt;80.0% were considered novel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS145279-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d74aAeEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS145279-supplement-Supplementary_methods.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d74aAeEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS145279-supplement-Supplementary_tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d74aAeEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge BBS/E/T/000PR9816 (NC1 - Supporting EI’s ISPs and the UK Community with Genomics and Single Cell Analysis) for data generation and BB/CCG1720/1 for the physical HPC infrastructure and data centre delivered via the NBI Computing infrastructure for Science (CiS) group.</p><sec id="S32"><title>Funding</title><p>BBSRC Core Capability Grant BB/CCG1720/1 (AH, RJ, RR-P)</p><p>BBSRC funded Norwich Research Park Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership grant BB/M011216/1 (BC) BBSRC Designing Future Wheat grant BB/P016855/1 and its constituent work packages DFW WP4 Data Access and Analysis (AH, RJ, RR-P, JK, IPK, SG, SE, CY)</p><p>BBSRC grant BB/J004596/1 as part of the Wheat Improvement Strategic Programme (WISP) (JK, IPK, SG, SE, CY)</p><p>USDA-ARS CRIS 3020-21000-011-000-D (JF)</p></sec></ack><sec id="S33" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P56">Sequencing data produced as part of this study, along with the <italic>Am. muticum</italic> assembly is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendata.earlham.ac.uk/wheat/under_license/toronto/Hall_2021-10-08_wheatxmuticum">https://opendata.earlham.ac.uk/wheat/under_license/toronto/Hall_2021-10-08_wheatxmuticum</ext-link>. <italic>Am. muticum</italic> Illumina short-read sequencing reads available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendata.earlham.ac.uk/wheat/under_license/toronto/Grewal_et_al_2021-09-13_Amybylopyrum_muticum/">https://opendata.earlham.ac.uk/wheat/under_license/toronto/Grewal_et_al_2021-09-13_Amybylopyrum_muticum/</ext-link>.
