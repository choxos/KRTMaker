<abstract>
<p id="P1">The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529/Omicron variant was first characterized in South Africa and was swiftly designated a variant of concern<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Of great concern is its high number of mutations, including 30-40 mutations in the virus spike (S) protein compared to 7-10 for other variants. Some of these mutations have been shown to enhance escape from vaccine-induced immunity, while others remain uncharacterized. Additionally, reports of increasing frequencies of the Omicron variant may indicate a higher rate of transmission compared to other variants. However, the transmissibility of Omicron and its degree of resistance to vaccine-induced immunity remain unclear. Here we show that Omicron exhibits significant immune evasion compared to other variants, but antibody neutralization is largely restored by mRNA vaccine booster doses. Additionally, the Omicron spike exhibits reduced receptor binding, cell-cell fusion, S1 subunit shedding, but increased cell-to-cell transmission, and homology modeling indicates a more stable closed S structure. These findings suggest dual immune evasion strategies for Omicron, due to altered epitopes and reduced exposure of the S receptor binding domain, coupled with enhanced transmissibility due to enhanced S protein stability. These results highlight the importance of booster vaccine doses for maintaining protection against the Omicron variant, and provide mechanistic insight into the altered functionality of the Omicron spike protein.</p>

<p id="P2">Since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population in late 2019, adaptive evolution of the virus has resulted in increased transmissibility and resistance to vaccine- or infection-induced neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, the initial D614G mutation in the virus spike (S) protein enhanced virus stability, infectivity, and transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. This initial adaptation was followed by the emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), which rapidly spread from Europe to become the global dominant variant in other parts of the world<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Subsequently, the Beta (B.1.351) variant exhibited substantial resistance to neutralization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, although failed to disseminate as widely. The most recent wave of the pandemic is attributed to the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant characterized by moderate neutralization resistance combined with enhanced transmissibility, driving its dominance worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Despite these evolutionary leaps, vaccine-mediated protection from severe disease and hospitalization remained high<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The emergence of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has generated serious concern about the continued efficacy of vaccines and the future course of the pandemic<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. In addition to its sheer number of mutations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, Omicron contains specific alterations that have previously been shown to impact vaccine resistance, namely in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a primary target of host neutralizing antibodies to the S protein, as well as a number of other non-RBD mutations, including some in the S2 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, when present in a geographic region, the Omicron variant constitutes a rapidly increasing proportion of COVID-19 cases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>, suggesting a further enhancement of transmissibility.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Resistance of Omicron to neutralizing antibodies in two-dose vaccinees, booster-dose recipients and COVID-19 patients</title>
<p id="P4">Given heightened concerns about Omicron’s transmissibility and vaccine resistance, we examined the its S protein compared to other major SARS-CoV-2 variants using a previously reported pseudotyped lentivirus system<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. We first examined infectivity using lentivirus pseudotypes and HEK293T-ACE2 as target cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, the infectivity of Omicron was largely comparable to the other major variants, all of which were lower than the ancestral D614G. However, in a more physiologically relevant host, human lung epithelia-derived CaLu-3 cells, Omicron exhibited reduced infectivity relative to D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">We next examined the ability of Omicron to escape vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, a critical measure of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. To address this, we collected sera from 48 health care workers (HCWs) 3-4 weeks post-second dose of either Moderna mRNA-1273 (n = 20) or Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (n = 28). Having previously examined this cohort for the ability of the D614G, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants to escape serum antibody neutralization (nAb)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, we compared the neutralization resistance of Omicron to these variants of concern. We found that the Omicron variant exhibited significantly more neutralization resistance, i.e., 22.9-fold (p &lt; 0.001), compared to ancestral D614G, with the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants exhibiting a 1.2-fold, 4.4-fold (p &lt; 0.001), and 2.0-fold (p &lt; 0.01) decrease in nAb titers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In total, only 27.1% (13/48) of HCWs exhibited nAb titers against Omicron above the detection limit (NT<sub>50</sub> &lt; 80); however, several individuals (1-3) exhibited strong nAb titers that were maintained against Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d and h</xref>). Moderna mRNA-1273 in HCWs slightly outperformed Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>), as we have reported previously <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">We further sought to examine resistance to vaccine-induced immunity for Omicron along with D614G, Alpha, Beta, and Delta for 23 HCWs 1-11 weeks post-booster vaccination. We found that booster vaccination not only increased the nAb NT<sub>50</sub> titer against all variants, including D614G, but also significantly restored neutralization of Omicron, with only 3.3-fold reduced NT<sub>50</sub> relative to D614G, which was even less than the 4.3-fold reduction for the Delta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data indicate that booster dose administration not only enhances nAb titers, but also enhances the breadth of the nAb response, especially against Omicron. For 18 HCWs, we analyzed the post-second dose and post-booster dose samples, which showed significantly higher nAb titers following booster vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b-f</xref>). Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2-vaccinated HCWs exhibited slightly higher nAb titers than Moderna mRNA-1273-vaccinated HCWs post-booster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We further examined nAb resistance of Omicon and other major variants in ICU (n = 9) and hospitalized non-ICU (n = 9) patient serum samples collected during the 2020/D614G wave of the pandemic prior to vaccination. We found that Omicron was completely resistant to D614G-wave patient serum samples, with only 22.2% (2/9) of ICU and 11.1% (1/9) of hospitalized patients exhibiting a threshold of nAb titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f and h</xref>). We further examined ICU patient samples (n = 19) collected during the Delta wave of the pandemic, including 5 confirmed as Delta infections by sequencing of virus from nasal swabs. Serum from these infected patients exhibited potent neutralization of Delta, as would be expected, while Omicron still exhibited strong resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g and h</xref>). Although mean titers from these individuals were comparable to boosted HCWs, a more significant proportion, 47.4% (9/19), exhibited no detectable nAb titers against Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g and h</xref>). Further, this population contained 5 patients fully vaccinated with two doses, 1 fully vaccinated with 1 Johnson &amp; Johnson dose, and 1 partially vaccinated (1 dose of Pfizer), which dramatically out-performed unvaccinated patients against Omicron and other variants, except Delta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1h</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>Omicron spike exhibits reduced ACE2 binding, furin cleavage and cell-cell fusion</title>
<p id="P8">To better understand the impact of the Omicron mutations on binding to the virus receptor ACE2, we transfected HEK293T cells with variant spike constructs and determined S surface expression, as well as their capacity to bind to soluble ACE2 (sACE2), using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a-d</xref>). We observed comparable levels of S expression for Alpha, Beta, and Delta relative to D614G, with Omicron showing a slight reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">e</xref>), as detected by a polyclonal antibody T62 against S1 or by anti-FLAG antibody specific for the N-termini of each recombinant spike. However, by normalizing for S surface expression in five independent experiments, we observed that Omicron variant exhibited a 2.4-fold reduced binding to sACE2 compared to the ancestral D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d-f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We further sought to examine the processing and incorporation of the Omicron S protein into viral particles. Pseudotyped virus was purified and probed for the S1 subunit of S alongside virus producer cell lysate. We found that Omicron S, similar to that of Alpha, exhibited a reduced furin processing into S1 compared to D614G and Beta; consistent with prior reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>, the Delta variant showed increased furin cleavage in the spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Notably, substantially less S1 was detectable in purified Omicron pseudotyped virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), despite a modestly low level of p24, which may reflect reduced incorporation of the Omicron S into pseudotyped virions and accounts for its decreased infectivity compared to D614G.</p>
<p id="P10">We next examined the efficiency of Omicron S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP and S protein constructs, and then co-cultured with HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 (HEK293T-ACE2) for 24 hrs. Cell-cell fusion was imaged using fluorescence microscope. We observed a marked reduction in the size of syncytia induced by Omicron S compared to other variants, especially by Delta and Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These results were confirmed using a more quantitative Tet-Off-based fusion assay, where spike and Tet-Off-expressing HEK293T cells were co-cultured with HEK293FT-mCAT-Gluc cells expressing ACE2. Upon cell-cell fusion, Tet-Off would induce the expression of <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase driven by a tetracycline-controlled transcription factor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. The Omicron variant exhibited 1.7-fold lower cell-cell fusion compared to D614G (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), consistent with reduced efficiency in mediating fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Omicron spike has enhanced capacity for cell-to-cell transmission</title>
<p id="P11">We reported the ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike to mediate cell-to-cell transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, To measure the efficiency of this process by Omicron S, we co-cultured with HEK293T-ACE2 target cells with HEK293T pseudotyping virus-producer cells and assessed cell-to-cell transmission after 24 hrs. Unexpectedly, we found that Omicron drastically increased the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission, with 4.8-fold higher levels than D614G and other variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>);, despite comparable levels of cell-free infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), reduced ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and reduced cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Omicron spike exhibits less S1 shedding</title>
<p id="P12">Given the reduced ACE2 binding of Omicron, we speculated that its spike may be less stable. We therefore sought to explore the stability of the Omicron S in parallel with other VOC spikes. First, we examined ACE2-induced S1 subunit shedding by transfecting HEK293T cells with variant S constructs. Cells treated with or without sACE2 and S1 containing-media were collected, and S1 subunit was immune-precipitated using anti-Flag beads. We observed reduced S1 shedding in the Omicron variant for both sACE2-treated and untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), despite relatively comparable levels of S expression in the cells, with the exception of Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). While this may be related to the low ACE2 binding of Omicron variant, distinct mutations unique to Omicron spike, especially those in the furin cleavage site, like contribute to their differential S1 shedding.</p>
<p id="P13">To provide additional molecular insights, we created a structural model of the Omicron spike protein using the cryo-EM structure of D614G strain spike (PDB 7KRR) as a homology modeling template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Structural analysis of the inter-protomer interface indicated an increment in the Omicron spike (6397 Å<sup>2</sup>) compared to the G614 spike (6017.4 Å<sup>2</sup>). The overall solvation free energy gain (ΔiG) shifts from -59.6 kcal/mol to -60.4 kcal/mol, reflecting the enhanced hydrophobic interaction at the Omicron S trimer interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, additional hydrophilic interactions are introduced by Omicron mutations that stabilize the spike trimer formation, including the N856K mutation, which enables formation of a salt-bridge and a hydrogen bond with residues D568 and T572, respectively, on the neighboring protomer. Moreover, the N764K mutation, jointly with the residue D737, forms hydrogen bonds with residue N317 on the neighboring protomer. These inter-protomer interactions enhance association between protomers, as well as between subunits S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> inset). The structural model also revealed two critical conformation-stabilizing mutations, T547K and L981F, located close to the base of the spike RBD. When RBD is in the “down” conformation, K547 is in close proximity to both residue 981 in the core of S trimer and residue D389 on the base of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The hydrophobic interaction formed by K547 and F981, together with the salt-bridge formed by K547 and D389, would lock RBD in the “down” conformation. The “up” conformation of RBD disrupts the interaction among these three residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> inset).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">In this work, we examined the efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity against the Omicron variant, along with molecular and virological features of Omicron spike, in parallel with other variants. We found that, while recipients of two-doses of mRNA vaccines showed minimal neutralization of the Omicron variant, recipients of a booster dose, either Moderna or Pfizer, exhibited much stronger neutralizing capacity against Omicron. The fold-difference between nAb titers against D614G and Omicron in the boosted group (3.8-fold) vs. that in the two-dose vaccine group (22.9-fold) revealed that a booster dose not only raises nAb levels, but also increases the breadth of circulating nAbs, a finding that is similar to a recent report by Pfizer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. While underlying mechanisms for this remain unclear, enhanced breadth of protection likely is due to additional affinity-maturation following a third antigen exposure. As the Omicron variant may have evolved from a lineage distinct from Delta<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>, it is unsurprising that Omicron exhibited strong resistance to nAb from unvaccinated Delta-infected ICU patients, with Omicron exhibiting ~8-fold lower nAb sensitivity than Delta for this group.</p>
<p id="P15">One surprising finding is that, distinct from Alpha, Beta, and Delta, the Omicron spike exhibited reduced binding to soluble ACE2, which likely accounts for, at least in part, its lower cell-cell fusion efficiency. This may indicate a fitness cost following an accumulation of RBD mutations while under selective pressure for nAb escape. Additionally, reduced cell-cell fusion would reduce cytotoxicity and could contribute to a lower virulence for the Omicron variant, which has been tentatively reported by anecdotal evidence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P16">Alternatively, reduced ACE2 binding could be reflective of a strategy to reduce premature S inactivation that would enhance virus transmissibility. This possibility is supported by the low S1 shedding observed for Omicron, and confirmed by enhanced stability of the RBD-closed conformation in homology modeling. Notably, infectivity of Omicron in HEK293T-ACE2 cells was not impaired, indicating that it retains functional receptor utilization. However, Omicron exhibited reduced infection in CaLu-3 cells. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to predominantly utilize a TMPRSS2-mediated plasma membrane entry route in CaLu-3 cells, while a cathepsin-B/L-mediated endosomal entry route dominates in HEK293T-ACE2 cells<sup>

</sup>. Thus, Omicron S may have evolved to be less fusogenic and utilizes plasma membrane fusion less efficiently in order to minimize potential cytopathogenic effect.</p>
<p id="P17">Indeed, the Omicron variant exhibited enhanced cell-to-cell transmission, which would facilitate virus spread. Cell-to-cell transmission is commonly used by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and is a highly efficient mechanism of virus spread within a host<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Enhanced cell-to-cell transmission may help compensate for other observed defects in the Omicron S protein, such as reduced ACE2 binding and fusogenicity. Notably, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does not absolutely require ACE2, and extended cell-cell fusion by its spike impairs cell-to-cell transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, cell-to-cell transmission is resistant to neutralizing antibodies, implicating another potential mechanism of Omicron immune evasion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P18">Overall, our report highlights the need for booster dose administration to better combat the emerging Omicron variant, and that reformulation of existing mRNA vaccines to target Omicron may not be necessary with a three-dose vaccine regimen. However, the emergence of future divergent variants may further compromise even boosted immunity. Evidence to date suggests no significant enhancement of virulence for Omicron; however, a definitive conclusion will require population level studies as this variant spreads to new locales. Indeed, continued monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is vital to allow for rapid investigation of their transmissibility, neutralization resistance, and pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Vaccinated and ICU patient cohorts</title>
<p id="P19">Vaccinated HCW samples were collected under approved IRB protocols (2020H0228 and 2020H0527). Sera were collected 3-5 weeks post second vaccine dose for 48 HCWs which included 20 Moderna mRNA-1273 and 28 Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccinated HCWs. In the study group, 23 HCWs received homologous vaccine booster doses 34-42 weeks post second dose, these included. Sera was then collected from these 23 HCWs 1-11 weeks post vaccine booster dose. These samples included 6 Moderna mRNA-1273 and 17 Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 boosted HCWs.</p>
<p id="P20">D614G-wave ICU and hospitalized non-ICU patient samples were collected under an approved IRB protocol (OSU 2020H0228) as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Delta-wave ICU patient samples were collected under an approved IRB protocol (2020H0175). Plasma samples were collected 3 days after hospitalization. Where detectable, the strain of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the ICU patients was determined by viral RNA extraction on nasal swabs with QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit followed by RT-PCR (CDC N1 F: 5’-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT-3’; CDC N1 R: 5’-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG-3’; CDC N2 F: 5’-TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA-3’; CDC N2 R: 5’-GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA-3’) and Sanger sequencing to identify virus strain. Due to risk of infection, Delta-wave ICU patient plasma samples were treated with 1% Triton X100 to inactivate virus. A starting dilution for virus neutralization assays of 1:640 was found to not exhibit Trition X100 mediated cell toxicity.</p>

<title>The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant exhibits strong immune-escape that is overcome by booster vaccination.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagrams of SARS-CoV-2 S variants used for pseudotyping, which indicate the location of specific mutations as well as the S1 and S2 subunits of S, the N-Terminal Domain (NTD), Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Fusion Peptide (FP), and Trans-membrane domain (TM). (<bold>b</bold>) Infectivity of pseudotyped viruses produced in parallel for infection of HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2. (<bold>c</bold>) Infectivity of pseudotyped lentivirus in human lung epithelia-derived CaLu-3 cell line. Bars in b and c represent means +/- standard deviation, and significance is determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple testing correction. Results of at least 3 independent experiments are averaged and shown. (<bold>d</bold>) Sera from 48 HCWs collected 3-4 weeks after second mRNA vaccine dose was used to neutralize pseudotyped virus for variants, and the resulting 50% neutralization titers (NT<sub>50</sub>) are displayed. (<bold>e</bold>) Sera from 23 HCWs following homologous mRNA booster vaccination were assessed for nAb titers. (<bold>f</bold>) Sera from 9 ICU COVID-19 patient samples and 9 hospitalized non-ICU COVID-19 patient samples collected in 2020 prior to the approval of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were assessed for nAb titers. (<bold>g</bold>) Sera from 19 ICU COVID-19 patient samples collected during the Delta-wave of the pandemic were assessed for nAb titers. Mean NT<sub>50</sub> values in panels d-g are displayed at the top of plots along with relative neutralization sensitivity with D614G set to 100%; bars represent mean +/- standard error, and significance relative to D614G is determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple testing correction. (<bold>h</bold>) Heat maps showing patient/vaccinee NT<sub>50</sub> values against each variant. Patient/vaccinee numbers are identified as P for Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccinated/boosted HCW, M for Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccinated/boosted HCW, I for ICU patient samples collected during the 2020 D614G-wave, H for hospitalized non-ICU patient samples collected during the 2020 D614G-wave, or D for ICU patient samples collected during the Delta-wave. P-values are represented as *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001; ns, not significant.</p>

<title>The Omicron S protein exhibits low S1 shedding, consistent with predicted increase in stability.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) HEK293T cells were transfected with S constructs and treated with or without sACE2. Cell lysate and cell culture media were collected after sACE2 treatment, and shed S1 subunit in cell culture media was immune-precipitated with anti-Flag beads. Blots were probed with anti-S1 and anti-GAPDH, and S1 shedding was quantified by NIH ImageJ by setting D614G to 1.0. (<bold>b</bold>) Structure of Omicron spike protein viewed from side. Mutations of Omicron are highlighted by red sticks and semi-transparent red surfaces. RBD of the yellow protomer is in an “up” conformation. Upper inset: the mutation N856K enables formation of salt-bridge and hydrogen bond with the residues D568 and T572, respectively on the neighboring protomer (green). Lower inset: the mutation N764K enables formation of hydrogen bond with residue N317 on the neighboring protomer (grey) and salt-bridge with residue D737 on the same protomer (yellow). (<bold>c</bold>) Omicron mutations T547K and L981F stabilize RBD in “down” conformation. Structure of Omicron spike protein by homology modeling was illustrated as surfaces (yellow and grey protomer) and ribbon (rainbow protomer). Upper inset: When RBD is in “down” conformation, Omicron mutation T547K enables formation of salt-bridge with residue D389 located on the base of RBD. Mutation T547K and L981F together enhance the hydrophobic interaction between the neighboring protomers (green and grey). Lower inset: When RBD is in “up” conformation, the interactions between these residues are disrupted.</p>
