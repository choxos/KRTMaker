Here we assessed adaptive evolution across genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome by correlating clade growth with mutation accumulation as well as by comparing rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence, clustering of mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and degree of convergent evolution of individual mutations. We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">After 20 months of global circulation, basal lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been almost completely replaced by derived, variant lineages. These lineages are classified by the WHO as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) based on genetic, phenotypic and epidemiological differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The effort to track the spread of these variants (and of the pandemic in general) through genomic epidemiology has resulted in a massive corpus of sequenced viral genomes. In the GISAID EpiCoV database alone, there are 2.5 million sequences and counting as of the end of July 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This thorough sampling offers an opportunity to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a virus as it entered a naive population, spread rampantly, and, subsequently, began to transmit through previously exposed hosts. Here, we are particularly interested in whether SARS-CoV-2 viruses show phylogenetic evidence of adaptive evolution during the first year and a half of transmission in humans.</p><p id="P3">Seasonal influenza and seasonal coronaviruses both exhibit continual adaptive evolution during endemic circulation in the human population. In the case of influenza H3N2, transmission through an exposed host population results in adaptive evolution within hemagglutinin (HA). The HA1 subunit of hemagglutinin both mediates binding to host cell receptors and is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. Thus, in the context of an exposed host, selection for receptor binding avidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and for escape from humoral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] drive fixation of mutations in the HA1 subunit. The coronavirus protein subunit equivalent in function to HA1 is spike S1. Previously, we showed that at least two seasonal coronaviruses (229E and OC43) exhibit adaptive evolution concentrated in the S1 subunit of spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. By demonstrating that strong immune responses to a particular historical isolate of 229E do not neutralize 229E viruses that circulate years afterwards, Eguia et al confirmed that 229E evolves antigenically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Standard methods used to detect adaptive evolution in seasonal influenza and seasonal coronaviruses rely on the fixation (or near fixation) of nonsynonymous changes, and thus require years or decades of evolutionary time. These methods are ill-fit to identify early adaptive evolution of a virus that has experienced a recent spillover event. For example, the common ancestor of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses is currently no earlier than January 2020, corresponding to the base of clade 20A or lineage B.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global">nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global</ext-link>). Here, we present a new method to identify regions of the genome undergoing adaptive evolution, which is well-suited to early time points. This method correlates clade success with the accumulation of protein-coding changes in certain genes. We apply this method to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from Dec 2019 to May 2021, focusing on the period of VOC and VOI emergence.</p><p id="P5">With this method, we aim to present a rigorous quantification of the evolutionary process during this time and to show that the observed success of variant viruses is a result of adaptive, not neutral, evolution. We conduct these analyses across the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify foci of adaptive evolution. We complement these results with analyses of <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> accumulation, evolutionary dynamics, and convergent evolution to provide evidence that genetic changes are contributing to viral fitness and identify genomic regions that are responsible.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in spike S1 correlates with clade success</title><p id="P6">RNA viruses are known for their remarkably high error rates and, thus, the rapid generation of mutations. Despite possessing some proof-reading capacity (a relatively rare function for an RNA virus), SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulating roughly 24-25 substitutions per year (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/adaptive-evolution/2021-05-15?l=clock">nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/adaptive-evolution/2021-05-15?l=clock</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]). The null hypothesis is that these substitutions reflect neutral evolution: the result of genetic drift acting on random mutations. To determine whether this is true, or whether adaptive evolution is also contributing to the accumulation of mutations, we started by comparing substitution rates in different regions of the genome.</p><p id="P7">We built a time-resolved phylogeny with a balanced geographic and temporal distribution of samples collected between December 2019 and May 15, 2021 that includes 9544 viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>). For every internal branch on the phylogeny, we tallied the total number of mutations that occurred between the phylogeny root and that branch. We grouped deletion events with nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as they are protein-changing and contribute to the evolution of some regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Plotting mutation counts over time shows that spike S1 accumulates nonsynonymous changes at a rate of 8.4 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup> substitutions/codon/year, or about 5.5 substitutions per year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is a disproportionate percentage of the genome-wide estimate of 24 substitutions per year. As a control, we counted S1 synonymous mutations, and found they accumulate at 2.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> substitutions/codon/year, close to the naive expectation from base composition that 22% of mutations should be synonymous. The per-codon rate of nonsynonymous mutation in S1 is roughly 17 times higher than in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene.</p><p id="P8">We hypothesize that adaptive evolution is driving the high rate of S1 nonsynonymous substitutions relative to S1 synonymous substitutions and RdRp nonsynonymous substitutions. And, though each S1 substitution will have a different effect on fitness, this observation suggests that this class of mutations is, on average, under positive selection. If this is the case, we would expect a correlation between S1 substitutions and a clade’s evolutionary success: clades that happened to accumulate more S1 substitutions should have, on average, higher fitness (and hence faster growth in frequency) than clades that have accumulated fewer S1 substitutions. Based on this logic, we introduce a new method for detecting adaptive evolution, which looks for regions of the genome where mutation accumulation is associated with clade frequency growth. Because positive selection causes alleles or clades to increase in frequency in a logistic (rather than linear) fashion, we measure logistic growth rate and plot this versus mutation accumulation.</p><p id="P9">Clade success and the number of nonsynonymous S1 mutations are positively correlated, with a correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> of 0.46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test whether this correlation is greater than expected, we randomized the placement of mutations across branches of the phylogeny and computed a <italic>p</italic>-value between the empirical <italic>r</italic> and the distribution of <italic>r</italic> values from 1000 randomizations. The positive correlation between S1 mutations and logistic growth rate is statistically significant compared to the expected distribution (<italic>p</italic>=0.003), but is absent for S1 synonymous mutations and is not significant for RdRp substitutions (<italic>p</italic>=0.256) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We applied this method to every gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). The highest nonsynonymous mutation rate is observed in ORF8. However, ORF8 substitutions are not correlated with clade success (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and many lineages acquire premature stop codons in ORF8, indicating that the high rate of ORF8 substitutions is likely due, at least in part, to a lack of functional constraints. Mutations within other regions of the genome, including spike S2 and nucleocapsid (N), also accumulate at reasonably-high levels but do not correlate well with clade success (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Besides S1, only Nsp6 (<italic>r</italic>=0.35, <italic>p</italic>=0.011) and ORF7a (<italic>r</italic>=0.43, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) have a strong correlation with clade growth rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3 and S4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Though ORF7a substitutions appear highly correlated with clade success, this correlation is driven solely by the rapidly growing Delta variant, which possesses 3 mutations in ORF7a. Removing Delta clades from the analysis drops the <italic>r</italic> for ORF7a from 0.43 to 0.16, whereas <italic>r</italic> for S1 and Nsp6 only dip from 0.46 to 0.41, and from 0.35 to 0.32, respectively. This indicates that the correlation between S1 and Nsp6 substitutions and clade success is a general feature of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Thus, the metric presented here provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving adaptively and that the predominant locus of this evolution is spike S1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence is highest in S1</title><p id="P12">A classical method for assessing the average directionality of natural selection on some region of the genome is <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic>, measuring the divergence of nonsynonymous sites relative to synonymous sites. A <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> value less than 1 indicates that the region is, on average, under purifying selection, while <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> greater than 1 indicates positive selection on the region. Because even the most rapidly evolving genes are still subject to structural and functional constraints, it is rare for an entire gene to have a <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio greater than 1. For instance, the HA1 subunit of H3N2, which is the prototypical example of an adaptively-evolving viral protein, has <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> of 0.37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P13">For various regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we computed the accumulation of non-synonymous and synonymous divergence in 2-month windows between January 1, 2020 and May 15, 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This measures <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> of branches leading to tips sampled within each 2-month window and captures the progressive enrichment of mutations by natural selection, i.e. mutations that persist and contribute the viral population will be captured in this measure, while mutations that die out will be excluded. The <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio within RdRp, S2, and the structural proteins Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) is consistently under 1 at all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> within S1 increases over time, with an apparent inflection point in mid-2020, and the <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio exceeding 1 in late-2020 and 2021 with the most recent time point measured at 1.80. For comparison, we used the same methodology to compute <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> for influenza H3N2, influenza H1N1pdm and seasonal coronavirus OC43 from 2009 to 2021 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). We observe that following emergence in humans in 2009 of influenza H1N1pdm, <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> in HA1 subunit peaked at 0.72 roughly a year after the beginning of that pandemic and declined in the following 4 years, while endemic viruses H3N2 and OC43 showed relatively stable <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> over this same time period.</p><p id="P14">The increase over time in SARS-CoV-2 S1 <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> could be due to a variety of reasons. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses include the appearance of a new selective pressure on S1 substitutions, or the acquisition of mutations that change the mutational landscape to be more permissive towards S1 substitutions. Regardless of the cause, this change suggests a temporal structure to the adaptive evolution in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Nonsynonymous mutations in spike S1 cluster temporally</title><p id="P15">A hint of this temporal structure can be seen by tracing individual mutational paths through the tree, from root to tip. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6</xref> plots the accumulation of nonsynonymous S1 mutations along ten representative paths, leading to 10 different emerging lineages. Along each of these paths, there appears to be an initial period of relative quiescence, followed by a burst of S1 substitutions. To test whether this temporal clustering of mutations differs from what would be expected given the phylogenetic topology and the total number of observed S1 substitutions, we calculated wait times between mutations (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Briefly, we created a null expectation by running 1000 iterations of mutation randomization in which the phylogenetic placement of every observed mutation is shuffled. The distribution of wait times is dependent on tree topology and total number of mutations, so the expectation is different for each category of mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7</xref>).</p><p id="P16">If mutations are clustered, there should be an excess of short wait times in the empirical data relative to the expectation. This is what we observe for S1 nonsynonymous mutations, where the distribution of wait times is left-skewed, with an overabundance of short wait times compared to the expected distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mean wait time between observed S1 substitutions is significantly lower than the expected mean wait time (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001), while there is no significant difference for S1 synonymous or RdRp wait times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Ci</xref>). This difference is driven by short wait times because there is a significant difference between the proportion of observed versus expected wait times under 0.3 years for S1 nonsynonymous, but not S1 synonymous or RdRp, mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Cii</xref>). These results indicate a temporal structure to the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 within the S1 subunit, which is characterized by mutation clustering.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Specific mutations associated with successful clades</title><p id="P17">We next sought to identify specific adaptive mutations throughout the genome. We note that convergent evolution is a good indicator of positive selection because each additional independent occurrence on the phylogeny of the mutation is increasingly unlikely under neutral evolution. As other groups have reported, there are many mutations shared by the VOCs that have arisen via convergent evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Here, we combine this observation of convergent evolution with logistic growth rate to find mutations that have arisen in the SARS-CoV-2 population multiple, independent times and expand into successful clades after each occurrence.</p><p id="P18">In this analysis, we focus on the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during the period of time between the emergence of this virus in humans and mid-May 2021. We estimate that, during this period of time, VOC viruses are primarily competing with basal SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This allows us to examine the overall fitness effects of specific mutations in viral lineages that are successful during this period of time. After May 2021, VOCs comprise a majority of the global virus population, and similar analyses on later time points would speak to the relative competitiveness of the variants.</p><p id="P19">For every deletion and substitution observed on the phylogeny, we tallied the number of independent occurrences and found the mean logistic growth rate of all clades where this mutation occurred. We limited this analysis to internal branches with 15 or more descending samples to limit the influence of stochasticity and sequencing errors that often occur on terminal branches. As expected, the bulk (84%) of mutations occur just once. Roughly 4% of mutations arose 4 or more times, and the majority of these mutations are located in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). For seven of these convergently-evolved mutations, the mean growth rate is higher than the tree-wide average growth rate. For three of these mutations (S:95I, S:452R and ORF1a:3675-3677del), the mean growth rate exceeds the 90th percentile of mean growth rates expected from a mutation that occurs the same number of times on a randomized tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">This analysis reveals influential mutations during a snapshot of time in the ongoing adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. In mid-May 2021, the Delta variant was rising in frequency. Both S1 mutations we identified as important drivers of adaptive evolution (S:95I and S:452R) are present in the Delta variant as well as a handful of other emerging lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S8</xref>). The specific mutations identified by this analysis will vary over time and depend on a multitude of factors (genetic, epidemiological, and otherwise) that determine clade success. However, ORF1a:3675-3677del consistently appears as a top hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S9</xref>). Remarkably, this deletion, which ablates amino acids 106-108 of Nsp6, arose 8 independent times and emerging lineages descend from each branch this deletion occurs on (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Because recombination is common in coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], we investigated the possibility that these 8 occurrences of the ORF1a:3675-3677 deletion were due to recombination, rather than convergent evolution. We considered all pairs of lineages containing this mutation as potential recombinants and compared informative mutations in the potential donor and acceptor. The closest informative mutations flanking ORF1a:3675-3677del are not shared by any pairs of lineages, offering a lack of evidence for recombination and strong support for convergent evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A 3-amino acid deletion in Nsp6 is associated with accumulation of S1 substitutions</title><p id="P22">The ORF1a:3675-3677 deletion in Nsp6 exhibits striking convergent evolution and consistently precedes successful viral lineages. Because we have shown that S1 mutation accumulation is also associated with clade success, we next asked whether there is a relationship between the number of S1 substitutions in clades containing ORF1a:3675-3677del.</p><p id="P23">We created an expectation for the mean number of S1 mutations that should be observed in clades with ORF1a:3675-3677del by generating 100 randomized trees where the mutation occurred on 8 branches selected by a multinomial draw. To make the expectation as fair as possible, we constrained the randomized branches to be on or after the date that the first Nsp6 deletion was observed. Under this expectation, there is no difference between the mean number of S1 or RdRp substitutions in clades that have the ORF1a:3675-3677 deletion versus clades that do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). However, in the empirical phylogeny, there are significantly more S1 substitutions in clades with the Nsp6 deletion versus clades without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, right).</p><p id="P24">That clades with ORF1a:3675-3677del have higher numbers of S1 substitutions does not speak to the directionality of this relationship. In other words, it is possible that ORF1a:3675-3677del occurs in lineages that already have a lot of S1 substitutions, or that a lot of S1 mutations accumulate in clades that already have ORF1a:3675-3677del. To determine the directionality of this difference, we considered every phylogenetic path that contains the Nsp6 deletion and found the difference between the final number of S1 substitutions on that path and the number of S1 substitutions that had accumulated before the deletion. On average, around 2.5 S1 nonsynonymous mutations accumulate after ORF1a:3675-3677del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is the second largest increase in S1 mutation accumulation following any convergently-evolved mutation, behind S:681R. These results do not indicate that the deletion directly causes S1 substitutions, but they do add to the observations of convergent evolution and high clade growth rates in suggesting that ORF1a:3675-3677del is an adaptive mutation and an influential factor in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Detecting adaptive evolution is both highly interesting from a basic scientific perspective as we seek to understand how and when this type of evolution occurs, and highly relevant from a public health perspective as we strive to curb the transmission of infectious diseases. As widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation continues, our best defense is through vaccination. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines showed high efficacy in clinical trials, but we must be proactive to ensure their continued effectiveness. Vaccines against viruses that undergo antigenic drift, like influenza, must be continually updated to match circulating variants. Therefore, the propensity of SARS-CoV-2 to evolve adaptively in spike S1 (the location of most neutralizing antibody epitopes) has important bearing as to whether the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will also need to be regularly updated.</p><p id="P26">SARS-CoV-2 exhibits convergent evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and some of the notable mutations that have occurred multiple times independently (like S:501Y and S:484K) appear in multiple VOCs, suggesting positive selection on these mutations. In the context of deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments, mutations at 501 increase ACE2 binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and mutation to site 484 escapes antibody binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Recurrent mutations at S:681 enhance S1/S2 subunit cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], a protein-modification that is essential for spike-mediated cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and thus is thought to contribute to increased viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Many other convergently-evolved mutations are also shared by VOCs and possess demonstrably different phenotypes, often altering antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Despite the demonstrably advantageous effects of observed mutations, it is too soon, evolutionarily, to pick up strong signals of adaptive evolution by classical methods that rely on fixation of nonsynonymous mutations. Instead, we capitalize on the high temporal and geographic density of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data to create a new method for identifying adaptive evolution and regions of the genome where this evolution is localized. This method identifies genes where amino acid substitutions significantly correlate with clade growth rate. This can be intuitively interpreted as genes with high rates of amino acid substitutions (suggestive of positive selection) that result in more successful viruses (suggestive of a positive fitness effect) are undergoing adaptive evolution and is effectively a continuous analog to partitioning differences between polymorphism and divergence in the classical McDonald-Kreitman test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We find that the spike S1 subunit shows strong signals of adaptive evolution by this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Our inference of adaptive evolution is based on a correlation between S1 substitution accumulation and clade success that falls well outside the null expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is important to emphasize that these results speak to the average evolutionary effect of S1 substitutions. This does not mean that every S1 substitution is selectively advantageous, and it is likely that some mutations have larger effects on fitness than others. In fact, it is possible that successful viruses contain some S1 substitutions that do not contribute to their evolutionary success. One possibility is that these mutations could have arisen during long-term infections where they were advantageous within a single host. For instance, S1 mutations 484K and 501Y have been observed to arise from continued evolution within a single host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the parallel evolution of these particular mutations is due to a selective advantage at a within-host, rather than between-host, level. Within-host selection pressures may help to explain why some mutations such as 484K occur again and again across the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the context in which S1 mutations arose does not affect our finding that viruses with more nonsynonymous mutations in S1 are more successful, on average, within the global population of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.</p><p id="P29">Phylogenetic inferences of evolution can be biased by the samples included in the analysis. To reduce sampling biases, our study is based on a phylogeny of 9544 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled evenly over space and time. The strong correlation between S1 mutation accumulation and clade growth rate persists if the number of genomes included in the phylogeny is doubled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S10</xref>), indicating that our results are not biased by the number of samples included in the analysis. We also find that global adaptive evolution in S1 is not driven solely by certain geographic regions. Using phylogenies that only include samples from a particular geographic region, we observe that clade success strongly correlates with S1 substitutions in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S11</xref>). The only region where this correlation is not observed at this timepoint is Africa, where decline in frequency of a particular clade of Beta drives an overall lack of correlation.</p><p id="P30">In addition to sampling biases, there are several limitations to our approach presented here. Firstly, our analysis intentionally considers the average effect of mutations in different regions of the genome on viral fitness, with the goal of taking a populations genetics approach to quantify adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This means that, while we observe a significant correlation, given a correlation coefficient of <italic>r</italic> = 0.46, our results cannot predict the fitness of specific variants solely based on S1 mutation counts. Similarly, as mentioned above, this means it is likely that some successful viral clades contain S1 substitutions that are not advantageous, but rather, are hitchhiking along with positively-selected mutations. Additionally, our analysis focuses on the period of VOC and VOI emergence from December 2019 to May 2021. So, while we can speculate how our findings of high adaptive potential in S1 will translate to future evolution of the virus, we cannot directly predict how the pace of adaptive evolution will change over time.</p><p id="P31">We observe temporal structure in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the correlation between clade success and S1 substitutions changes over time, though shows strong signals of adaptive evolution from Jan to Sep 2021 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S12</xref>). Enrichment of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence (<italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic>) in S1 also increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, substitutions within S1 cluster temporally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), rather than accruing at a steady rate. This temporal structure potentially indicates a changing evolutionary landscape: either through the emergence of new selective pressure, and/or through the occurrence of permissive mutations that made adaptive mutations more accessible.</p><p id="P32">While the overall <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio in S1 is 0.70, <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> is 1.66 along persistent lineages in 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This high ratio is remarkable when compared to the antigenically-evolving HA1 subunits of influenza H3N2 and H1N1pdm or the S1 subunit of seasonal coronavirus OC43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). We estimate the mean <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio for HA1 in influenza H3N2 to be 0.36 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>), which is similar to the 0.37 estimated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, influenza H3N2 has been endemic in the human population for over 50 years, and its current evolution is largely driven by antigenic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Viral evolution directly after spillover into a new host species can differ from evolution at endemicity. For instance, for 2 years following its emergence in 2009, the evolution of influenza H1N1pdm is thought to largely have been adaptation to a new host, whereas adaptive evolution after 2011 has been dominated by antigenic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Accordingly, we observe that <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> in the H1N1pdm HA1 subunit peaks at 0.72 in 2010 shortly after pandemic emergence, and then declines to a more stable value of ~0.3 beginning in 2014. An initially high rate of protein-coding changes is consistent with the idea that, soon after a spillover event, there are many evolutionarily-accessible mutations that are advantageous in the new host environment. It is unclear whether the observed <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> ratio in SARS-CoV-2 S1 will persist or whether it is a feature of this virus’s recent emergence and will drop in the years to come.</p><p id="P34">Together, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> offer phylogenetic evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving adaptively and that the primary locus of this adaptation is in S1. Our results are consistent with experimental demonstration of phenotypic changes conferred by VOC spike mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Adaptive evolution in the S1 subunit during the period we focus on (December 2019 to March 2021) is likely driven by selection to adapt to a new host by increasing infectivity of human cells. However, the amount of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is rising globally, increasing the selection for antibody escape. Given the virus’s demonstrated propensity for adaptive change in S1, antigenic drift will likely begin to sculpt the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The potential antigenic impact of adaptive S1 mutations, which are accruing at pace over 4 times that of influenza H3N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>), suggests that it may become necessary to update the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain. Indeed, the emergence of the Omicron Variant of Concern demonstrated a SARS-CoV-2 virus with an extraordinarily high number of S1 substitutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] that spread rapidly across the world and showed significantly reduced neutralization titers relative to preceding variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. With Omicron, we now know that significant antigenic variants can emerge with highly modified S1 domains. However, the observed pace of adaptive evolution in S1 perhaps should have suggested the potential for emergence of such a variant.</p><p id="P35">In addition to S1, our results suggest that substitutions within Nsp6 and ORF7a may significantly contribute to the success of viral clades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We expand on these genewide results by identifying specific adaptive mutations, using the confluence of convergent evolution and clade success. This analysis turned up many S1 mutations that have been extensively studied, along with mutations to nucleocapsid (N), another target of antibody-recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], and a couple mutations in Nsp6, Nsp4 and M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The non-S1 mutations ORF1a:3255I (in Nsp4), M:82T, and N:205I in particular show compelling evidence of positive selection. These sites enriches our understanding from gene-wide analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>: though <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref> is the primary genomic locus of adaptive evolution, a handful of positively-selected mutations in other genes are also influencing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population.</p><p id="P36">Our analysis of specific adaptive mutations suggests the possibility of differences between within-host selection for viral replication and between-host selection for transmission. Viruses belonging to Delta have shown greater between-host transmission rates than other VOC or VOI viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], but are lacking mutations that have occurred repeatedly and that were associated with increased clade growth (notably ORF1a:3675-3677del, S:484K and S:501Y). It is possible that some mutations display a large degree of parallelism due to specific within-host pressures that occur in secondary infections of partially immune individuals, despite having only modest effects on between-host transmission.</p><p id="P37">It is important to note that the precise mutations that appear most influential depend on when the analysis is done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>). The fitness effect of a mutation is not an absolute quality — it depends on a multitude of influences including genetic background of the viral lineage, other co-circulating lineages, existing host immunity, and epidemiological factors (such as geographically heterogeneous mitigation efforts). Additionally, lineages can grow in frequency due to stochastic effects. It is, therefore, expected that mutations associated with successful clades will change over time and that these changes reflect both a changing fitness landscape and the stochastic nature of evolution. Mutations that transcend this or, in other words, are associated with successful lineages at multiple time points, are more likely to have important, adaptive functions. One such mutation is ORF1a:3675-3677del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The ORF1a:3675-3677 deletion removes 3 amino acids (SGF) from a predicted transmembrane loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] of the Nsp6 protein. Across the coronavirus family, the Nsp6 protein, in coordination with Nsp3 and Nsp4, forms double-membrane vesicles that are sites for viral RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In SARS-CoV-2, Nsp6 suppresses the interferon-I response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. It is unclear whether ORF1a:3675-3677del impacts either of these functions. This deletion is not observed in other sarbecoviruses, residues 3675 and 3676 are 100% conserved, and only synonymous and conservative changes are seen at 3677 in this subgenus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, in SARS-CoV-2, this deletion exhibits close to the highest level of convergence, presence in VOCs, mean logistic growth rate, and increase in S1 mutations in descending lineages. Future experimental study of this deletion would increase our understanding of what functions, apart from enhanced cell entry and potential antibody escape, were highly advantageous during the early adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P39">So far, ORF1a:3675-3677del has not been observed in Delta viruses and our results suggest that the appearance of a sublineage of Delta possessing ORF1a:3675-3677del may outcompete basal Delta viruses. However, the Omicron variant, which appeared in late November 2021 and spread rapidly, possesses a very similar deletion, where Omicron viruses from the primary BA.1 PANGO lineage exhibit ORF1a:3674-3676del. This provides yet another example of deletion to this region of Nsp6 being associated with consequential VOC viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P40">Source code for all analyses presented in this manuscript is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/blab/sarscov2-adaptive-evolution">github.com/blab/sarscov2-adaptive-evolution</ext-link>.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Phylogenetic reconstruction of a subsampling of global SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences</title><p id="P41">All primary analyses in this manuscript were performed using data downloaded from the GISAID EpiCoV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gisaid.org">gisaid.org</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]) on July 29, 2021 and curated by the Nextstrain nCoV ingest pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/nextstrain/ncov-ingest">github.com/nextstrain/ncov-ingest</ext-link>).

<bold>A)</bold> For every clade in the phylogeny, mutations relative to the root of the phylogeny are tallied and plotted against the date of the base of that clade. Nonsynonymous S1, synonymous S1, and nonsynonymous RdRp mutations are plotted separately. Nonsynonymous mutations include nonsynonymous SNPs and deletions. The primary axis (left, black ticks) displays mutations per codon, and the secondary axis (right, gray ticks) shows the absolute number of mutations accumulated in each clade. Each point is colored according to the lineage it belongs to. Points are fit by linear regression. <bold>B)</bold> For every clade, mutation accumulation (as in A) is plotted against logistic growth rate and the points are fit by linear regression. <bold>C)</bold> The empirical correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> between mutation accumulation and logistic growth rate (colored bar) is compared to an expected distribution (gray) to yield a <italic>p</italic>-value.

The dashed blue lines indicate the time windows centered at April 1, 2020 (left) and January 1, 2021 (right). Every internal branch within these windows and the phylogenetic path that connects that branch back to the root is highlighted in red. The accumulation of divergence is calculated along these paths. Nonsynonymous divergence is calculated as the nonsynonymous Hamming distance between the sequence of an internal branch and the root sequence, normalized by the total possible number of nonsynonymous sites. The same is done for synonymous divergence. <bold>B)</bold> The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous is calculated for various coding regions within the genome.

<bold>A)</bold> Every mutation observed on internal branches of the phylogeny is plotted according to the number of times this mutation occurs on the tree and the mean logistic growth rate of all clades it occurs in. Convergently-evolved mutations that appear 4 or more times across the phylogeny are shown in the inset. The average growth rate of all clades is shown with a dotted line. <bold>B)</bold> Observed mean growth rates of convergently-evolved mutations are compared to the mean growth rate expected for a mutation occurring on the phylogeny the same number of times. Convergently-evolved mutations that have a mean growth rate falling at or above the 90th percentile of the expected values are labeled. <bold>C)</bold> The analysis shown in panel A was completed for 5 time points, spanning two months. Each date represents the maximum date of sequences included in the analysis. Mutations that occur at least 4 times (convergent mutations) and result in a higher-than-average mean growth rate are shown in dark yellow.
