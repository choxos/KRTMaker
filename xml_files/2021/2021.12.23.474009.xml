Here we use genetic code expansion to demonstrate that phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 N at either of two pseudo-repeats centered at Ser197 and Thr205 is sufficient for 14-3-3 binding. According to fluorescence anisotropy, the pT205-motif, present in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV, is preferred over the pS197-motif by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms, which display unforeseen pT205/pS197 binding selectivity hierarchy. Crystal structures demonstrate that pS197 and pT205 are mutually exclusive 14-3-3-binding sites, whereas SAXS and biochemical data indicate 14-3-3 binding occludes the Ser/Arg-rich region, inhibiting its dephosphorylation. This Ser/Arg-rich region of N is highly prone to mutations, as exemplified by the Omicron and Delta variants, with our data suggesting how the strength of its 14-3-3 binding can be linked with the replicative fitness of the virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Host-virus interactions</kwd><kwd>RNA viruses</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>14-3-3 protein</kwd><kwd>phosphopeptide binding</kwd><kwd>binding selectivity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The 46-kDa nucleoprotein (N) is common for single-stranded RNA viruses, including positive-sense coronaviruses, and is responsible for replication, packaging and storage of viral genomic RNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

To test this hypothesis directly, we first sought to obtain N protein phosphorylated exclusively at the Ser197 position. Since enzymatic treatment always yielded multiply phosphorylated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), we utilized genetic code expansion to site-specifically install phosphoserine at a genetically programmable TAG stop codon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Although phosphoserine was successfully incorporated to generate SARS-CoV-2 N pS197 protein, confirmed by the discrete upward shift on a Phos-tag gel electrophoresis, we noticed considerable spontaneous dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Therefore, for further analysis we produced the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with a non-hydrolyzable analog of phosphoserine, phosphonomethylalanine (nhpS197), inserted in place of the TAG<sup>197</sup> codon, which caused the desired shift on Phos-tag gel with a negligible amount of unphosphorylated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This approach was inspired by effective imitation of phosphoserine by nhpSer in previous 14-3-3 binding studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">On SEC, human 14-3-3γ co-eluted with SARS-CoV-2 N nhpS197, but not with unphosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N, confirming the formation of the phosphorylation-dependent complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>) and the role of S197 phosphorylation in recruiting 14-3-3.

As a control we produced unphosphorylated N.S197L protein, and differences in their phosphorylation status were confirmed by Phos-tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).

This observation was totally unexpected given the very similar sequences of both peptides, implying that the corresponding protein-peptide complexes feature different interfaces and chemical contacts. To understand the molecular basis of these phenomena, we crystallized 14-3-3σ complexes with both phosphopeptides and determined structures by X-ray crystallography at high resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Crystallography explains the selectivity of 14-3-3 for SARS-CoV-2 N phosphopeptides</title><p id="P15">X-ray structures of 14-3-3σ with both peptides had one 14-3-3 dimer in the asymmetric unit, where each protomer was occupied by the target phosphopeptide. Eight out of ten pS197 phosphopeptide residues and all ten residues for the pT205 phosphopeptide are clearly defined in electron density, revealing key protein/peptide interactions. Residues at +1 and -1 positions with respect to each phosphosite are H-bonded to the side chains of the conserved 14-3-3σ residues Asn175 and Asn226, while hydroxyl groups of both Thr198 and Ser206 of the peptides (position +1) are identically involved in H-bond formation with Asn175 and the conserved Lys122 residue of 14-3-3σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). An additional H-bond in the case of the pS197 peptide between the side chain of its Asn196 residue and Asn226 of 14-3-3σ is replaced by the additional hydrophobic contact in the case of the pT205 peptide, formed between the methyl group of phospho-Thr205 residue and the side chain of 14-3-3σ’s Val178. In contrast to the nearly equivalent central six-residue segments of both peptides (Cα RMSD=0.7 Å), crystal structures revealed significant differences in their C-terminal regions. In the case of the pS197 peptide, we could not detect any stabilizing <italic>in-trans</italic> interactions after Pro199. The lack of defined electron density for the last two Ser residues of this peptide indicate flexibility and hence inability to form stabilizing interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). On the contrary, the pT205 peptide was additionally stabilized <italic>in-trans</italic> by i) the hydrophobic contacts of its Ala208 with Val46 of 14-3-3 and Met210 with Phe118 and Ile168 of 14-3-3, ii) the H-bonding interaction between the peptide’s carbonyl of Ala208 with the side chain of Ser45 of 14-3-3σ and iii) the salt bridge between the peptide’s Arg209 with Glu14 of 14-3-3σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, Glu14 is absolutely conserved in all human isoforms of 14-3-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Therefore, the salt bridge interaction involving Arg209 is likely shared by all 14-3-3 isoforms and, together with factors i)-ii), confer the consistently higher affinity of the pT205 peptide versus pS197 peptide to 14-3-3 proteins, as observed biochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These peptides of the same SARS-CoV-2 N polypeptide chain cannot simultaneously occupy both grooves of the 14-3-3 dimer, as the pS197 and pT205 phosphosites are only 7 residues apart (the inter-phosphate distance is 20 Å). For bidentate binding to 14-3-3, at least 15 extended residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> are needed to sufficiently separate the phosphosites (e.g. 22 in the 5N6N structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>) and cover the required ~35 Å distance between the two binding sites of the 14-3-3 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). While a mixed pS197/pT205 binding within the 2:2 SARS-CoV-2 N/14-3-3 complex cannot be excluded, binding of two pT205 motifs to the 14-3-3 dimer would be thermodynamically preferred, unless mutations in the SR region change this selectivity.

Interestingly, the S197L mutation has a statistically mild outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

The effect of 14-3-3γ was also preserved for phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N, but the densitometric analysis was less reliable in this case. The reaction mixture contained 25 μM of phospho-N, 60 μM 14-3-3γ and 2 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and dephosphorylation was followed by taking aliquots of the mixture at different time points, quenching them by acetone precipitation and analyzing on Phos-tag (10% polyacrylamide gels with 50 μM Mn<sup>2+</sup> Phos-tag) and SDS-PAGE gels. The control reaction did not contain 14-3-3γ. Phos-tag runs were followed by GFP fluorescence on a control lane. Densitometry was done in Image Lab 6.1 (Bio-Rad). The experiment was done four times with different amounts of phosphatase, which yielded qualitatively similar results.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Analytical size-exclusion chromatography</title><p id="P34">The interaction of N proteins and 14-3-3γ was analyzed using a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) operated at a 0.45 ml/min flow rate on a Prostar 335 chromatographic system (Varian, Australia). When required, fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In specific cases, a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column and a 0.8 ml/min flow rate was used. The buffer, used to equilibrate the columns, contained 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 3 mM NaN<sub>3</sub> and 200-300 mM NaCl. We noticed that free unphosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N.S197L absorbed onto the column when equilibrated with &lt;220 mM NaCl. Therefore, the reported experiments contained at least this much salt in the SEC buffer. Experiments were done at least three times with qualitatively very similar results.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Multi-angle light scattering (MALS)</title><p id="P35">To determine absolute masses of MBP-14-3-3ζ, 14-3-3γ and its complex with phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N.S197L, we used SEC coupled to MALS.

The concentration signal was obtained from SEC traces recorded at 280 nm and weight extinction coefficients 1.38 for MBP-14-3-3ζ, 1.13 for 14-3-3γ, and 1.02 for the 14-3-3γ/pN.S197L complex.

A series of concentrations of MBP-14-3-3 proteins in a 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 (33 μl each) was diluted 2-fold by a 100 nM solution of either FITC-labeled peptide to obtain 66 μl samples containing 50 nM peptide, MBP-14-3-3 (from 0 to 110 μM) and 0.01% Tween 20. After 5 min incubation at room temperature the fluorescence anisotropy readout did not change with time, indicating equilibrium. Then, each sample was split into three 20 μl aliquots, the plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 25 °C at 250 g to remove air bubbles, and the FP data were recorded.
