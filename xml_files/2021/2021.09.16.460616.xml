<abstract>
<p id="P1">In the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic several variants have emerged that are linked to increased transmissibility and immune evasion. These variants are recognized as variants of concern (VOC). In this study, we describe a B.1.1.523 variant that shares many spike mutations with current VOC. Receptor-binding domain mutations E484K and S494P were observed but also a deletion (position 156-158) in the N-terminal antigenic supersite that is similar to the delta-variant. These mutations are linked to immune evasion in VOC that could lead to less effective vaccines. This variant has been reported in various different countries and continents despite the dominance of B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variant. Furthermore, the B.1.1.523 pangolin lineage as a whole is recognized as a variant under monitoring since 14<sup>th</sup> of July 2021.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected millions of people during the pandemic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. During this pandemic, various variants of this virus were detected in surveillance and were linked with increased infectivity or immune evasion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Data of these variants are shared via the GISAID (Global initiative on sharing all influenza data) database that helps to understand spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) assign certain variants as “variant of concern” (VOC) because of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease, or immune evasion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Current VOC are B.1.1.7 (alpha-variant), B.1.351 (beta-variant), P1 (gamma-variant), and B.1.617.2 (delta-variant). These VOC harbor several spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) are frequently targeted by neutralizing antibodies mostly directed to the NTD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In addition, a so called antigenic supersite is described in the NTD with three regions. Potent neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma target this antigenic super site. Still, mutations in the RBD are important as for example E484K mutation is also strongly linked with immune evasion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. This short communication describes a new variant with a new combination of various concerning spike mutations shared with VOCs and is already spread across many countries. The pangolin lineage of this variant is B.1.1.523 and is recognized as a variant under monitoring since 14<sup>th</sup> of July 2021 <sup>

<title>GISAID data download and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing</title>
<p id="P3">All sequences and metadata of B.1.1.523 variant cases with spike mutations S:E156del, S:F157del, S:R158del, S:E484K, and S:S494P were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org">www.gisaid.org</ext-link> on 19 August 2021 (n=551). These mutations were chosen because of links with immune evasion. Of these cases 18 were removed based on bad quality score in Nextclade (<underline>clades.nextstrain.org</underline>). In routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance one case of this B.1.1.523 variant was identified with nanopore sequencing as described in von Wintersdorff et al. 2021 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Data-analysis</title>
<p id="P4">Visualization of the filtered data by country, month, and age group were made in R statistical software, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Figures were made using the R package ggplot2 version 3.3.2. Phylogenetic analysis was performed as described in von Wintersdorff et al. 2021 but with nextstrain/ncov version 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov">https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov</ext-link>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The amino acid sequence of Wuhan strain, VOC, and B.1.1.523 variant were aligned in MEGA v10.0.5 with Cluster Omega algorithm, with the Wuhan strain as a reference. The 3D structure of the spike protein of the B.1.1.523 variant was predicted using CoVSurver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app/">https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app/</ext-link>)</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P5">In total, 533 cases of B.1.1.523 with spike mutations S:E156del, S:F157del, S:R158del, S:E484K, and S494P are reported in GISAID till 19 August 2021. Most cases are reported in Russia followed by Germany but cases have also been seen in the USA and Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). The first few cases were collected in February 2021 and increased in numbers to 203 cases in May 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>). Number of cases is lower in June and July 2021 as sequenced-based surveillance data is typically lagging. This variant did not show an age related pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Sharing of the pangolin lineage and some spike mutations does not necessarily imply a single origin of this variant. Also, recognition of the first cases in Russia does necessarily implicates that this variant originates from this country. To address both issues a phylogenetic tree was constructed and showed that all cases are similar as they are in the same branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Based on this phylogenetic analysis the origin of this variant is likely Russian as the first strain is reported from Moscow (green circle at 30 mutations (EPI_ISL_1823183), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">One of the reasons of concern about this variant is a three amino acid deletion in the NTD antigenic supersite and E484K mutation of the spike protein. Therefore a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed with the amino acid sequence of VOC and Wuhan-Hu-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). Three VOC, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2, have deletions in one of the regions of the NTD antigenic supersite. The deletion of B.1.1.523 is similar to the one of B.1.617.2 and has the E484K mutation that is shared in many VOC. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref> the predicted spike structure and interaction with human ACE2 receptor is shown. Spike mutations E484K and S494P are both in the RBD with the ACE2 receptor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P8">In this short communication we report a variant (B.1.1.523) with a new combination of concerning spike mutations that are shared with current VOCs. Many of these mutations are linked with immune evasion that could lead to less effective vaccines. This variant has been reported in various different countries and continents and likely originates in Russia. In addition, the number of cases appears to increase despite the dominant variants B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta).</p>
<p id="P9">Mutations that are shared with VOC or linked with immune evasion were S:E156del, S:F157del, S:R158del, S:E484K, and S:S494P <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Two mutations are in the RBD of the spike protein, positions 484 and 494, and are both linked to immune evasion in B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant. E484K mutation is also present B.1.351 (beta) and P.1 (gamma) variants that are strongly linked with reduced efficacy of vaccines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. These findings are supported in studies where the effect of spike mutations on efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma was investigated <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Similar studies were performed to investigate the antigenic super site of the NTD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In the β-hairpin region of the antigenic super site the B.1.1.523 variant has a deletion (position 156-158) similar to the currently dominant B.1.617.2 (delta) variant (S:E156G and 157-158del) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Other VOC also have deletions in one of the regions of the antigenic super site, B.1.1.7 (alpha-variant) position 144 and B.1.351 (beta-variant) position 241-243. As the mutations observed in this B.1.1.523 variant are strongly linked to immune evasion and disseminated to different continents, despite the dominance of both the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, this could be a variant of interest and should be monitored closely. However, as this is the first study that describes this variant of the B.1.1.523 lineage, there is yet no information on transmissibility that contributes to the need of actions required to prevent dissemination.</p>
