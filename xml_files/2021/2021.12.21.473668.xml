<abstract>
<p id="P1">Vaccine hesitancy and continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that may escape vaccine-induced immune responses highlight the urgent need for effective COVID-19 therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies used in the clinic have varying efficacies against distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants; thus, there is considerable interest in engineered ACE2 peptides with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These could have therapeutic benefit against multiple viral variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show how three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 peptide (sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1) markedly increase affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. We demonstrate high binding affinity to S protein of the early SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 isolate and also to multiple variants of concern: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 variants. In humanized K18-hACE2 mice, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide prevented acute lung vascular endothelial injury and lung edema (essential features of ARDS) and significantly improved survival after infection by SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 as well as P.1 variant of concern. These studies demonstrate for the first time broad efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> of an ACE2 decoy peptide against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and point to its therapeutic potential.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 3.5 million deaths world-wide by June 2021. The successful development of mRNA-based and adenoviral vaccines, which induce immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein with reported efficacy rates of 70% to 95% <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, represent a monumental milestone in reducing the pandemic. However, persistence of vaccine hesitancy in high-income countries <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>, limited supply of vaccines in low-income countries, breakthrough infections, and emergence of B.1.1.7 (“Alpha”), B.1.351 (“Beta”), P.1 (“Gamma”), and B. 1.617.2 (“Delta”) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), which carry S protein mutations exhibiting higher affinity for ACE2 that may escape vaccine-induced humoral immune responses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, highlights the urgent need for novel targeted therapeutics.</p>
<p id="P3">The trimeric S protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is a class I fusion protein proteolytically processed during biosynthesis into soluble S1 and membrane-tethered S2 subunits that remain non-covalently associated <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which engages ACE2 as a cell-surface entry receptor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The critical role of S protein for viral entry has led to the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics targeting the S-ACE2 interaction, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to epitopes on S that neutralize virus infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Monoclonal antibodies not only provide tight affinity for the viral target (K<sub>D</sub> &lt; 1 nM) but also harness endogenous host defense mechanisms, including interactions with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) to confer long serum stability (typical half-lives of IgG1 proteins are several weeks) and with FcγR on immune cells to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vivo <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. However, there are also serious limitations of mAb therapies. First, emergence of VOCs with S protein mutations appears to diminish neutralization capacity in some cases <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Second, mAbs are typically administered by intravenous (IV) infusion and less is known about their pharmacokinetic stability when applied locally in lungs via inhalation.</p>
<p id="P5">An alternative to mAbs is to use soluble wild type ACE2 (sACE2) or engineered soluble ACE2 peptides (we refer here to soluble constructs of ACE2 that include both protease and dimerization domains, sACE2<sub>2</sub>), which function as decoys for the viral S protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Wild type sACE2<sub>2</sub> has shown indications of efficacy in the clinic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> but was not effective as an Fc fusion for neutralizing virus in an <italic>in vivo</italic> infection model <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, and there are opportunities for next generation ACE2 derivatives with improved properties. We used deep mutagenesis to show that many amino acid substitutions within ACE2 enhanced the affinity for S protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. We also showed that a derivative of sACE2<sub>2</sub> with 3 mutations (T27Y, L79T, and N330Y), called sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4, bound S with 35-fold tighter affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.6 nM) and neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with sub-nanomolar IC50, on par with high affinity mAbs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. We showed that affinity increases (K<sub>D</sub> &lt; 0.1 nM) for S variants carrying the N501Y mutation associated with increased virus transmission <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. However, studies have not examined the efficacy of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 <italic>in vivo</italic> and its capacity to bind S protein from the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta VOCs.</p>
<p id="P6">Laboratory mouse strains do not show significant disease pathology when infected with SARS-CoV-2 because murine ACE2 has low affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. The K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model expressing human ACE2 driven by the epithelial K18 promoter developed severe lung injury and immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Acute lung injury (ALI) or its progression to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients is characterized by endothelial injury and breakdown of lung vascular barrier function via loss of lung endothelial cells and disruption of endothelial adherens junction protein VE-cadherin, which lead to protein-rich lung edema and respiratory failure <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. However, it is not clear whether animal models of COVID-19 show an analogous pathology of the lung vascular endothelium and whether treatment following inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 variants can prevent lung endothelial injury and ARDS or reduce mortality.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, we found that inoculation of K18-hACE2 mice with an original SARS-CoV-2 variant (WA isolate) induced severe lung vascular injury and that inoculation with the P.1 variant induced even greater injury as well as higher mortality. We explored the molecular basis for the tight binding between S of SARS-CoV-2 and our sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 decoy peptide by molecular dynamics (MD). We also characterized pharmacokinetics (PK) of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 in mice via different routes and further showed that tight affinity of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 persisted against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 showed exceptional efficacy in reducing viral entry, lung vascular hyperpermeability and preventing ARDS and mortality on challenging humanized mice with SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 or the P.1 VOC.</p>

<title>Comparison of acute lung endothelial injury and ARDS induced by SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 and P.1 variant of concern in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice</title>
<p id="P8">We inoculated K18-hACE2 mice intranasally with live SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 virus at 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU (N=10) or 1×10<sup>5</sup> PFU (N=10), and observed body weight loss, a marker of severe viral infection and survival. The higher dose (1×10<sup>5</sup> PFU) induced mortality starting at Day 5 whereas mice in the lower dose group (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) reached humane endpoints or died starting on Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The degree of weight loss was comparable with both viral doses during the first 5 days but due to the rapid death in the high dose group, we were unable to compare weight losses in both groups during advanced stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore chose inoculation with the lower dose (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 to study lung vascular injury as the disease progressed to the advanced stage. Lung transvascular permeability was evaluated at Day 7 post-inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA-1/2020 (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) using intravenous (IV) infusion of Evans Blue Albumin (EBA) tracer. Representative lung images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and quantification of lung EBA (lung microvessel permeability of albumin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced severe lung vascular endothelial injury at Day 7. Quantification of lung wet/dry ratio (a measure of pulmonary edema) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 also induced severe lung edema by Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Flow cytometric quantification of lung endothelial cells (ECs) showed that one third of the lung EC population was lost by Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-G</xref>). Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR showed that the mRNA levels of the endothelial adherens junction protein VE-cadherin significantly decreased by Day 7(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Histological analysis of lungs showed pulmonary hemorrhage and edema at Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>) and massive infiltration of immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Fibrosis staining (Trichrome blue and Sirius red) showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in collagen deposition at Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We also inoculated K18-hACE2 mice with the P.1 variant at a dose of 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU and observed death beginning earlier at Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). The P.1 variant induced significantly greater weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K &amp; 1B</xref>), lung vascular hyper-permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>) and edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>) by Day 6. We assessed viral replication by quantifying the expression level of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (NSP) and found that detectable levels of P.1 variant at Day 6 post-inoculation were 5 times greater than of WA-1/2020 at Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N-O</xref>). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA-1/2020 and P.1 VOC induced severe acute lung endothelial injury, resulting in lung transvascular permeability, lung edema, and death. P.1 variant induced more severe lung vascular injury and ARDS and death occurred 2 days earlier as compared to WA-1/2020.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Molecular basis for tight binding of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein</title>
<p id="P10">We next focused on a high affinity soluble ACE2 peptide that had been engineered to therapeutically target the S protein across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Assessment of the relative binding activities of single amino acid substitutions has previously informed design of the high-affinity peptide sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. To better understand the molecular basis for the increased affinity to the viral Spike protein, wild type and v2.4 ACE2 proteins were simulated by all-atom MD in both the unbound/apo and RBD-bound states. Approximately 400 μs of simulation data were collected for each apo protein. For all residues within the interface, the backbone and sidechain distances were calculated with respect to all other residues within 0.8 nm. A total of 74 distances were computed, and to assess surface dynamics, time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) determined critical residue movements from the higher dimensional dataset. TICA linearly transformed the MD dataset to find the slowest motions in the surface. For both wild type and v2.4 ACE2, three TICs were found with timescales larger than the lag time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A-C</xref>). The distance features that showed the highest correlation with the three TICs are the same for both proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A-B</xref>) and are near glycosylation sites (ACE2 residues 103 and 546). The projection of TIC 1 and TIC 2 components showed that these motions have similar distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D-E</xref>), suggesting that residue dynamics at the surface are not substantially changed between the two proteins.</p>
<p id="P11">To examine how the v2.4 mutations impacted interfacial interactions, we performed ~530 μs of simulation for wild type and v2.4 ACE2 proteins with the RBD bound. TICA calculations on interface residue distances <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup> showed that features most correlated with the four slowest components are in RBD loops 1 (residues 477-487) and 2 (residues 497-505) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). RBD loop 1 is close to v2.4 mutations T27Y and L79T, while RBD loop 2 is close to v2.4 mutation N330Y. Trajectory observation revealed that new polar interactions formed in the RBD loop regions with ACE2.v2.4 that were not present in the wild type complex. Y27 of ACE2.v2.4 hydrogen bonds to Y473 in RBD loop 1, ACE2.v2.4-T79 interacted with the backbone carbonyl of RBD-G485, and ACE2.v2.4-Y330 interacted with the backbone carbonyl of RBD-P499 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To obtain the ensemble distance distributions of these stable interactions, we built a Markov state model (MSM) on the MD data. MSM-weighted distributions demonstrated that all three newly formed interactions in the ACE2.v2.4 complex were stable (distance distributions are single peaks within 0.6 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and that the RBD loops are stabilized in closer positions in ACE2.v2.4 compared to the wild type complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures 2C-D</xref>). Furthermore, angle calculations for the loops with respect to the centers of mass for the RBD and ACE2 proteins demonstrated reduced variance in ACE2.v2.4 (RBD loop 1 standard deviation [SD] 2.0°, loop 2 SD 1.0°) compared to wild type (loop 1 SD 2.9°, loop 2 SD 1.9°). Overall, new interactions formed by ACE2.v2.4 stabilized RBD loops in close association with the receptor surface and higher affinity was explained by localized effects at the interface.</p>

<title>Pharmacokinetics of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide</title>
<p id="P12">Prior to performing <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy studies using the sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide described below, we characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the peptide in mice. We injected sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 (0.5 mg/kg) without a fusion partner into the tail veins of male and female mice and found the protein was rapidly cleared with a serum half-life estimated to be under 10 minutes as measured by ACE2 ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>) and ACE2 catalytic activity in serum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). This is much shorter than the serum half-life of wild-type sACE2<sub>2</sub> in humans (of 2 to 3 hours) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. No toxicity was observed when sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 was IV administered twice daily at 0.5 mg/kg for five consecutive days. Mice were euthanized on Day 7 and blood chemistry, hematology, and tissue pathology showed no differences with mock treated mice, underscoring the safety of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4.</p>
<p id="P13">Using an ELISA for human IgG1, both wild type sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 and sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 showed equivalent serum PK after IV administration (2.0 mg/kg) in male mice, with protein persisting for over 7 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). We therefore concluded that the three mutations in the high affinity sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 derivative did not substantially change PK. We next examined PK in male and female mice and again saw human IgG1 protein persisting for days in the serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), yet the ACE2 moiety was cleared within 24 hours based on an ACE2 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Measurement of ACE2 catalytic activity revealed even faster decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Immunoblot for human IgG1 confirmed that the fusion protein was proteolyzed in mouse blood to liberate long-lived IgG1 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Clearance of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 was recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubating the protein with normal mouse serum over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), but the protein was resistant to degradation in human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that human sACE2<sub>2</sub> has better stability in human patients and mouse studies likely underestimated how the protein will perform in humans. Further, no toxicity was observed in mice IV administered sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (2.0 mg/kg), followed up 7 days later with blood chemistry, hematology, and tissue pathology analysis.</p>
<p id="P14">In addition, the effects of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 delivered directly to the respiratory tract, the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was studied. Following intratracheal (IT) delivery (1.0 mg/kg), sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 persisted in lungs for at least 4 hours determined by ACE2 ELISA, human IgG1 ELISA, and anti-human IgG1 immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-I</xref>). Levels of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 absorbed into the blood were too low for detection. As observed for IV administration, wild type sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 and sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 had similar PK in lungs following IT delivery. We further investigated administration of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 by inhalation, in which the protein was nebulized for 30 minutes into a chamber holding the mice. sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 remained high and relatively constant for 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J-L</xref>). The different PK profiles based on route of administration (i.e., protein delivered directly into lungs persisted for hours but did not reach detectable levels in plasma, whereas IV delivered protein achieved high but short-lived plasma concentrations) offer opportunities to treat SARS-CoV-2 in different ways, guided by whether SARS-CoV-2 is primarily located in the respiratory tract or disseminated systemically.</p>

<p id="P15">We next assessed whether sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 blocked entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells using a replication-deficient pseudovirus which expresses the S protein and thus models SARS-CoV-2 cell entry <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Entry is mediated by S engagement of the surface receptor ACE2 and the surface protease TMPRSS2, as well as other entry mediators that facilitate infection <sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. We studied three cell types: the human lung epithelial A549 cell line, primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (hLMVECs), and an A549 cell line stably over-expressing hACE2 (hACE2-A549) to maximize its infectability by the pseudovirus. We observed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in all three cell types albeit at significantly higher levels in hACE2-A549 cells and lower levels in hLMVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). After pre-incubation of each cell type with sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 (i.e., wild-type) or sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 at 5 or 25 μg/ml for 1 hour, luciferase-expressing pseudovirus was added (MOI=0.1) for 24 hours. Luciferase activity in the cells after removal of the replication-deficient pseudovirus served as a measure of viral entry. Pre-treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in all three cell types but pre-treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 showed far greater efficacy in blocking viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 at 5 μg/ml was as effective as 25 μg/ml of sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1, suggesting that the engineered peptide had 5-fold greater efficacy in this assay.</p>
<p id="P16">We next examined <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. Based on the PK studies above, 10 mg/kg sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 (WT), 10 mg/kg sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1, or control peptide buffer (PBS + 0.2% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) was injected IV into K18-hACE2 transgenic mice at 30 minutes prior to systemic pseudovirus (10<sup>6</sup> PFU i.p.) administration and mice were then assessed at 24 hours. Tissue lysates of lung, heart, brain, and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) were assessed for luciferase activity. Viral entry into lungs was substantially higher than other organs even though the pseudovirus was injected intraperitoneally, consistent with preferred viral entry into type II alveolar lung epithelium due to higher hACE2 expression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Inhibition of pseudovirus entry was significantly greater in sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 pre-treatment mice when compared to sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 (WT) pre-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">To test the prophylactic effects of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 on live SARS-CoV-2 infection, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were pretreated with a single dose of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (10mg/kg) via IV injection 12h before SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) inoculation. While the PK studies indicated that serum levels of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 in mice fall within hours, investigations of ‘long-lived’ monoclonal antibodies with similar affinities for the viral spike have demonstrated prophylaxis with protein doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg administered 24h before inoculation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. We therefore hypothesized that sufficient levels of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 would remain in the mice at the delivered dose. All mice pre-treated with a single-dose injection of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 before inoculation survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) with slightly increased or no change in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). The mice with single-dose of PBS injection before the inoculation all died at Day 7 and 8 with ~30% loss of original body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). Furthermore, mice prophylactically administered sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 showed no significant lung vascular leakage and edema at Day 7 post-inoculation, compared to marked increases in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-G</xref>). Thus, single-dose sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 pre-treatment prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury.</p>

<title>Treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 prevents lung vascular endothelial injury and ARDS and improves survival following inoculation with live SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P18">To explore the therapeutic effects of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 on live SARS-CoV-2 infection, we chose two treatment timepoints: 12h or 24h following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation based on recent publications using neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. The timing of injection of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 post SARS-CoV-2 inoculation was chosen to begin treatment prior to onset of irreversible organ damage. Considering our mice were inoculated with high titer of SARS-CoV-2 (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) and all died within 5-8 days of viral inoculation, initiation of treatment at 24 hours post viral inoculation may be equivalent to treating human patients at the onset of moderate to severe symptoms.</p>
<p id="P19">We used a 50% higher peptide dosage for the later time (24 hours) to increase the likelihood of efficacy in the face of prolonged viral replication. K18-hACE2 mice were all infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU) and then assigned to three treatment groups: PBS group (control), sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (10 mg/kg) treatment group (V2.4 12H) starting 12 hours post-inoculation, and sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (15 mg/kg) treatment group (V2.4 24H) starting 24 hours post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Treatment was administered IV daily for 7 days. Both, V2.4 12H and V2.4 24H treatment groups demonstrated markedly improved survival of 50%-60% at 2 weeks whereas all mice in the control treatment group died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Initiation of treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 at either 12h or 24h post viral inoculation also prevented weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). We next determined efficacy of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 in preventing lung vascular endothelial injury and observed a marked reduction in lung transvascular albumin permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>). However, edema formation was not changed by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). The viral load of lung tissues evaluated by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>) to detect the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and SARS-CoV-2 NSP, demonstrated near complete elimination of viral gene expression by Day 7 in both sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">As we did not observe any significant reduction in lung edema by Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) despite the marked improvement in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), we posited that reduction of edema may occur gradually in the surviving mice. We therefore assessed the time course of lung vascular permeability changes in both treatment groups at baseline, Day 7, and Day 14 postinoculation with V2.4 12H and V2.4 24H treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). In the surviving mice (50-60% survival with peptide treatment versus 100% lethality in the no treatment group), lung transvascular albumin permeability and lung edema were restored to normal levels by Day 14 with either treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). Lung histology demonstrated that V2.4 12H and V2.4 24H treatment strikingly reduced immune cell filtration at Day 7 when compared to the control treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). These results showed that treatment with engineered sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG decoy peptide initiated as late as 24h after inoculation with a lethal dose of the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 isolate profoundly reduced lung vascular injury, prevented ARDS, and reduced mortality in a model of COVID-19.</p>

<title>High affinity binding of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 to S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern</title>
<p id="P21">SARS-CoV-2 has a moderate mutation rate (10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>) and variants have emerged with increased transmissibility and virulence, most notably the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) VOCs. The variants have multiple mutations in S, including changes in immunodominant epitopes that cause partial immune escape <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> and a N501Y substitution within the RBD that increases monovalent affinity for ACE2 by 20-fold <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Thus, we next assessed whether the decoy peptide was also efficacious against these new variants.</p>
<p id="P22">Using flow cytometry (a non-equilibrium experiment from which apparent binding strength was measured), binding of human cells expressing full-length trimeric S to wild type sACE2 and engineered sACE2.v2.4 was determined, using both monomeric sACE2 (residues 19-615) and dimeric sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 (ACE2 residues 19-732) to assess monovalent and avid binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Compared to wild type, monomeric sACE2.v2.4 showed markedly increased binding to all S proteins tested. The enhanced binding was less when avidity was considered, but nonetheless the engineered derivative remained tightly bound. Indeed, the engineered decoy receptor had increased binding signals to S from the newly circulating variants compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate, consistent with some S variants showing tighter binding to ACE2. The level of sACE2 bound to S-expressing cells diminished at high concentrations, consistent with shedding of ACE2-bound S1. We explored this further by analysis of sACE2 binding to S variants from the B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and C.37 (Lambda) lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Again, monomeric sACE2.v2.4 bound considerably tighter than the wild type decoy, with smaller differences for sACE2<sub>2</sub>-IgG1 proteins where avidity masks affinity changes. Due to the decoy inducing S1 loss, detection at the cell surface of an N-terminal tag on S decreased.</p>
<p id="P23">Monoclonal antibodies in clinical development have shown mixed results for broad affinity against SARS-CoV-2 variants <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Using flow cytometry, binding to S proteins from four VOCs was compared between sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 and mAbs that have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>): REGN10933 (casirivimab), REGN10987 (imdevimab), VIR-7831 (sotrovimab), and LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab). In this assay, sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 consistently shows high binding to S, better than VIR-7831 and LY-CoV555 but lower than REGN10987. The monoclonals REGN10933 and LY-CoV555 show markedly different binding strengths for the different S proteins. REGN10933 and sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 engage the ACE2 interaction motif on S<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup> and both induce S1 shedding at high concentrations. Overall, sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 broadly binds S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and with comparable strength to mAbs that have shown efficacy in the clinic.</p>

<title>sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 prevents lung vascular endothelial injury, ARDS, and improves survival following inoculation with P.1 variant of concern</title>
<p id="P24">Based on our observations that sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 binds S proteins of VOCs with even greater affinity than S protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>), we surmised that sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 would also be therapeutically efficacious against VOCs. Here we tested the efficacy of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 against the P.1 variant, an aggressive and devastating SARS-CoV-2 variant in transmissibility and death in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. We randomly assigned mice to three treatment groups: PBS group (control), sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (10 mg/kg) treatment group (V2.4 12H) starting 12 hours post-inoculation, and sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 (15 mg/kg) treatment group (V2.4 24H) starting 24 hours post-inoculation. Early treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 initiated at 12h post inoculation improved survival to 50-60% whereas delayed treatment initiation (starting at 24h post-inoculation) only delayed death but did not improve survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). The mice in V2.4 12H treatment group also showed attenuated weight loss during the first 6 days following viral inoculation and the surviving mice gradually recovered their weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Both V2.4 12H and V2.4 24H treatment groups demonstrated marked reduction in lung transvascular albumin permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>) and lung edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) at Day 6, indicating mitigation of ARDS.</p>
<p id="P25">The viral load of lung tissues evaluated by real-time PCR showed that initiating early treatment with sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 reduced the viral copy number by 75%, whereas delayed treatment initiation at 24h only reduced viral gene copies by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Using the viral plaque forming assay in lung tissue as a functional measure of viral load in lungs, we found that early sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 treatment markedly reduced viral plaque forming capacity on Day 6 by over 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">To study robustness of recovery of lung vascular function in mice that survived inoculation with the P.1 variant following sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 treatment, we assessed lung transvascular albumin permeability at baseline, Day 6, and Day 14 post-inoculation and with early V2.4 12H treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G-H</xref>). We observed that lung transvascular albumin permeability returned to near-baseline levels in surviving mice by Day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G-H</xref>). Histological analysis demonstrated reduced immune cell infiltration following infection with P.1 variant at Day 7 in the V2.4 12 hours and V2.4 24 hours treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>). Thus, sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 decoy peptide proved to be more effective when administered early during the infection with P.1 variant of concern.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P27">Acute lung injury and its progression to the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results in respiratory failure due to protein-rich lung edema formation. ARDS is the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. The severe lung edema is the consequence of breakdown of the lung endothelial barrier <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> due to injury of endothelial adherens junction, loss of lung endothelial cells as a consequence of cell death and denudation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>, and suppression of endothelial cell regeneration pathways <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. While there is growing evidence of endothelial cell disruption in autopsy samples of COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>, studies have focused on factors such as pro-thrombotic transition of the lung endothelium <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. Our studies showed loss of VE-cadherin and lung endothelial cell injury in the humanized K18-hACE2 model of COVID-19. Endothelial injury as quantified by measuring lung vascular endothelial permeability and resulting pulmonary edema and ARDS were severe in mice inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA, and were even more pronounced after inoculating the mice with the P.1 VOC. The more severe lung vascular injury explains the devastatingly high mortality rates in patients infected with the new more toxic variants <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. We also demonstrated higher affinity binding of ACE2 to Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs as compared to SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA.</p>
<p id="P28">The transgenic K18-hACE2 mice used to study the responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus (both of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA and the P.1 VOC) similarly expressed hACE2 in lung alveolar epithelial type II cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Thus, lung vascular injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 can only be ascribed to virus binding and entry into type II cells. The augmented endothelial injury and higher mortality with the P.1 variant was consistent with greater binding efficiency of ACE2 to the Spike protein of the variant. Lung endothelial injury is due to release of inflammatory cytokines or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules brought about by the infected type II alveolar epithelial cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. A key factor in the pathogenesis of lung endothelial injury is that the lung cells uniquely express higher levels of pro-inflammatory genes compared to endothelia of other organs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. This is believed to reflect the key role of the lung endothelium in the host-defense function of lungs (61). The enrichment of inflammatory genes in lung endothelial cells may therefore increase the vulnerability of the lung endothelial barrier cells to the “cytokine storm” elicited by COVID-19 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Thus, augmentation of the cytokine storm by the P.1 variant may have resulted in more severe lung endothelial injury and edema and mortality as compared to SARS-CoV-2 isolate 1/2020 WA.</p>
<p id="P29">The development of mRNA-based and adenoviral vaccines to induce immunity against SARS-CoV-2 with reported efficacy rates of 70% to 95% <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> has been a great success in translational science. However, the growing number of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has resulted in the emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs characterized by high transmissibility and evasion to varying degrees of the humoral immune response <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. The high transmissibility of these variants as a result of antigenic drift is due in part to the higher binding affinity of the Spike protein for ACE2, resulting in greater cell entry and infectivity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>. However, we showed that the higher affinity of variant Spike proteins for ACE2 can be therapeutically leveraged to engineer decoy peptides based on ACE2 that compete for Spike protein binding. We developed and tested the effectiveness of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide as an optimized receptor decoy. The decoy peptide acted as a ‘sponge’ for SARS-CoV-2 and prevented infection by blocking binding to ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.</p>
<p id="P30">While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern reduced the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>, our data demonstrate that the engineered sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide has even greater affinity for Spike variants. Previous studies have engineered high-affinity sACE2 decoys, some achieving even tighter affinity than sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 by combining more mutations <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>, yet minimizing the number of substitutions ensures that the decoy receptor closely resembles native ACE2, reducing opportunities for viral escape or potential drug immunogenicity.</p>
<p id="P31">We showed prophylactic administration of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 fully protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury. More importantly, we demonstrated that sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 treatment as late as 24h or 12h after virus inoculation reduced mortality by 50-60% for the WA-1/2020 and P.1 viruses, respectively. While treatment at 24h was too late to prevent death from the more virulent P.1 virus, lung vascular leakage, pathology and viral load were nonetheless reduced with survival time extended, demonstrating efficacy at reducing symptoms. While it is difficult to directly model the time course of human COVID-19 in animal studies, our therapeutic regimen compares exceedingly well to parallel studies using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1 and S2</xref> for comparisons of prophylaxis and therapy studies). Indeed, our use of a highly lethal infection model permitted broader assessment of how the peptide mitigates lung injury and death than many other studies in animal models that show minimal disease. A comparable assessment of monoclonal antibodies that are in the clinic demonstrated efficacy when the proteins were administered at 24h post inoculation in K18-hACE2 mice, but animals were infected at lower SARS-CoV-2 titers (1×10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> FFU) and weight loss mostly began at day 3 or 4<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. In our model, mice were inoculated with high virus titer (1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU), began to lose weight early by day 2, and all died within 5-7 days. We reason that initiation of treatment at 24h post viral exposure in this model may be equivalent to treating human patients at the onset of moderate to severe symptoms.</p>
<p id="P32">Although we focused on using intravenous delivery for our efficacy studies, the pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that inhaled or intratracheally applied peptide resulted in stable lung tissue concentrations. Therefore, for translational studies, one would envision staged therapy in which sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 is delivered locally in lungs via inhalation during the early post-exposure period and then systemically via intravenous route during later stages after virus dissemination.</p>
<p id="P33">We found that sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 was effective in sharply reducing lung vascular injury, ARDS, and mortality in mice infected with the P.1 variant, among the most highly transmissible VOCs with high mortality rate <sup>

</sup>. We also showed that the peptide bound all variant Spike proteins with similar or even greater affinity than the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This was also the case with the recent B.1.617.2 (Delta) virus, now the primary cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. Based on these data, it is reasonable to conclude that the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy will be similar for distinct variants.</p>
<p id="P34">We observed that the P.1. variant required earlier initiation of treatment (at 12h instead of 24h) following virus exposure to achieve 50-60% reduction in mortality. However, because the binding affinity for the P.1. Spike protein was even greater than the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate, the need for earlier treatment initiation likely reflected rapid dissemination and replication of the P.1. variant prior to therapy initiation. In this context, it would be useful to address whether efficacy improves by using either a higher peptide dose or increased administration frequency when initiating the delayed treatment against variants with high infectivity and replication rates.</p>
<p id="P35">Broad affinity of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 against SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as other coronaviruses that use ACE2 as an entry receptor<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>

<p id="P36">While we demonstrated the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of the engineered sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 peptide against two distinct live SARS-CoV-2 variants in the K18-hACE2 model, a non-human primate model <sup>

Another limitation is our focus on intravenous delivery, whereas intratracheal or inhalation delivery may be more readily applied in patients, especially in the outpatient setting. It would be useful in future studies to use varying doses and delivery route combinations for defined disease stages to identify the optimal combination prior to initiating human efficacy trials. Finally, we chose to fuse the ACE2 peptide to an unmodified Fc from IgG1 (isoallotype nG1m1), whereas others have considered fusions to Fc mutants or IgG4 to dampen interactions with FcγR subtypes that might contribute to inflammation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>

<p id="P37">In summary, we show for the first time that an engineered decoy ACE2 peptide demonstrating much higher affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is efficacious <italic>in vivo</italic> against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.

<title>Inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice and administration of sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4</title>
<p id="P39">Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protocols for animal experiments with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed by personnel equipped with powered air-purifying respirator in strict compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane treatment and approved by the University of Illinois Animal Care &amp; Use Committee (UIC protocol 18-076). Hemizygous K18-hACE mice with c57BL/6J background (strain#034860: B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed in groups and fed standard chow diets. The 8-10 weeks old mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg, intraperitonially). The mice were then inoculated intranasally with 1×10<sup>5</sup> PFU (plaque-forming units) of SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA or 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 isolate (WA) or the P.1 variant suspended in 20μL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 was administered intravenously (retro-orbital injection) either 12 hours before virus inoculation (single-dose) or 12 hours / 24 hours post virus inoculation (once a day for continuous 7 days) to the anesthetized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Genotyping of mice was performed by PCR using tail DNA. For the number of animals needed to achieve statistically significant results, we conducted a priori power analysis. We calculated power and sample sizes according to data from small pilot experiments, variations within each group of data, and variance similarities between the groups that were statistically compared. Animals with sex- and age-matched littermates were randomly included in experiments. No animals had to be excluded attributed to illness after experiments. Animal experiments were carried out in a blinded fashion whenever feasible.</p>

In adaptive sampling, protein conformational space is characterized with important features like distances, angles, and root mean square deviation (RMSD), and the feature space is clustered into microstates. The starting points for the next round of simulation are selected from the least populated states. The first 5 rounds of adaptive sampling were performed using the AMBER engine on Blue Waters supercomputing facility. The features selected for the adaptive sampling were backbone RMSD. Data collected over 5 rounds of adaptive sampling were clustered into 500 clusters, from which 500 structures were selected to submit to Folding@Home <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>
</sup>. Each structure was given 20 different starting velocities to begin 20 different trajectories. Simulations were run in OPENMM <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>
</sup> engine. For each apo system, ~ 400 μs of data were collected, and for each RBD-bound complex system, ~530 μs of data were gathered.</p>
<p id="P63">A Markov state model is built on MD data to get the unbiased estimates of the canonical ensemble of interface movements. The MSM calculates the canonical ensemble distribution from the eigenvector space of the transition probability matrix. To estimate the transition probability matrix, we featurized the MD simulation data with inter-residue distances between the human and viral protein interfaces. The featured space was linearly transformed into TICs. TIC space was clustered into microstates using k-means algorithm. The probability of a jump between one microstate (i) to another (j) with a particular lag time (<italic>τ</italic>) corresponds to the T<sub>ij</sub> element of the transition probability matrix, <bold>T</bold>. Feature calculations were performed with MDtraj. TIC calculation, clustering, and MSM building steps were done using PyEMMA <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>
</sup>. Lag time for MSM was selected by logarithmic convergence of implied timescales. To build the optimal MSM, VAMP2 scores of MSMs were calculated using different hyperparameters (TIC variance and numbers of clusters). Feature calculations and analysis of the trajectories were performed using MDtraj <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>
</sup> and CPPtraj <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>

<title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
<p id="P64">Sequences for monoclonal antibodies that had received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were pulled from the KEGG database (Accession No. REGN10933, D11938; REGN10987, D11939; VIR-7831, D12014; LY-CoV555, D11936). H and L chains were cloned with CD5 leader sequences into pcDNA3.1(+) and expressed in Expi293F cells. Proteins were purified using KancapA resin (Kaneka Corporation) and size exclusion chromatography with PBS as the running buffer. Peak fractions at the expected MW of ~150 kD were concentrated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Concentrations were determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the calculated extinction coefficient for mature protein.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P65">Quantification of replicate experiments is presented as the mean ± SEM. The student t-test, one-way and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests were used to determine statistical significance, with a P value threshold of less than 0.05. Significance levels are indicated in the figures as *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, and ***P &lt; 0.001. Based on our experience, we expect changes in the gene/protein expression and function measurements to be detected with 3 mice per group, so the effect size was determined as n = 3 or n &gt; 3. The variance between the groups that are being statistically compared was similar.</p>

<title>sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4 IgG1 prevents lung vascular endothelial injury and ARDS and improves survival following infection with P.1 variant of concern.</title>
<p>The three groups of K18 hACE2 transgenic mice were inoculated by SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 (Brazil) at 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU. Group 1 (PBS): PBS was given by IV injection 24 hours post inoculation. Group 2 (V2.4 12H): sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 10mg/kg were given by IV injection 12 hours post inoculation. Group 3 (V2.4 24H): sACE2<sub>2</sub>.v2.4-IgG1 15mg/kg were given by IV injection 24 hours post inoculation. The mice were injected once per day for 7 days. The survival probability was observed (<bold>A</bold>) and mouse weights were measured (<bold>B</bold>). N=10 for each group. (<bold>C</bold>-<bold>D</bold>) The mouse lungs were harvested at Day 6 post-inoculation to evaluate lung transvascular permeability – EBA assay (<bold>C</bold>) and lung wet/dry ratio (<bold>D</bold>) with baseline mouse lungs as control. (<bold>E</bold>) The viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs harvested at baseline and Day 6 post-inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 (Brazil) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR for the mRNA expression level of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and SARS-CoV-2 NSPs. (<bold>F</bold>) Viral Plague Form Assay was performed to measure the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs harvested at baseline and Day 6 post-inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 (Brazil). (<bold>G</bold>-<bold>H</bold>) Time course of lung transvascular permeability of V2.4 12H treatment group. The EBA assay (<bold>G</bold>) and Wet/dry ratio (<bold>H</bold>) were measured at baseline, Day 6 and Day 14 post-inoculation. (<bold>I</bold>) Representative H&amp;E staining of lung sections at baseline (1<sup>st</sup> column), control PBS group at day 7 post-inoculation with the P.1 variant (2<sup>nd</sup> column), sACE2.V2.4-IgG 12H treatment group at day 7 (3<sup>rd</sup> column), and sACE2.V2.4-IgG 24H treatment group at day 7 (4<sup>th</sup> column) post-inoculation with the P.1 variant. The images in the first row are low magnifications. Highlighted areas (Red) are shown in higher magnification in the second row. N=4 for <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>E, F</bold>, <bold>G</bold>, and <bold>H</bold>. Data are presented by mean ± SEM. *: P&lt;0.05, **: P&lt;0.01, ***: P&lt;0.001, ****: P&lt;0.0001 by Two-way ANOVA for <bold>C</bold> &amp; <bold>D</bold>; one-way ANOVA for <bold>E, F, G</bold> &amp; <bold>H</bold>.</p>
