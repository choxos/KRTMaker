<abstract>
<p id="P1">Effective small molecule therapies to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking as the COVID-19 pandemic continues globally. High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally, particles pseudotyped with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated rapidly over the last year into a disaster affecting all aspects of human life. While effective vaccines are now available, specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet and urgent need <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Because the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) virus, specific and high containment laboratory conditions are required to handle live virus experiments. However, most laboratories conducting high throughput screening (HTS) of compounds are limited to BSL-2 assays, a significantly limitation to lead discovery efforts.</p>
<p id="P3">Although virtual screens using in silico modeling technologies have been employed by many laboratories to search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of these compounds must be evaluated in physical experiments. For example, a recent drug repurposing screen using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay has confirmed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of several compounds reported by virtual screening studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 assays suitable for BSL-2 laboratory settings that are accessible to most researchers may contribute to missing experimental confirmation of virtual screening hits. Therefore, more BSL-2 compatible SARS-CoV-2 compound screening assays are needed for COVID-19 drug development.</p>
<p id="P4">The spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses are responsible for host receptor binding and fusion of viral bilayer membranes with host cell membranes to release the viral genome in the cytoplasm <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. To alleviate SARS-CoV-2 biosafety issues, several viral pseudotyping systems have been reported for the SARS-CoV-2-S protein, including the murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyping method <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. We have recently employed MLV pseudotyped particle (PP) viral entry assays for SARS-CoV-S and MERS-CoV-S to screen compound libraries for viral entry inhibitors in a BSL-2 setting <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. These viral entry assays utilize PPs that consist of bilayer membranes containing spike proteins and package luciferase reporter RNA instead of a viral genome. The binding of PPs to receptors on the host cell plasma membrane, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV, mediates entry of PPs into host cells. Upon entry, the luciferase reporter RNA is expressed, and after the introduction of the luciferase substrate, the luciferase enzymatic reaction produces a luminescence signal can be detected and used as an indicator of viral entry into cells.</p>
<p id="P5">Here we report a BSL-2 compatible SARS-CoV-2 PP assay that has been characterized and validated in a drug repurposing screen of over 5,000 compounds. Our results demonstrate that this SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay is robust for HTS and can be used for lead discovery and lead optimization. In addition, this assay can be used to determine whether the mechanism of action of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds found in other phenotypic screening assays is due to the inhibition of viral entry. We have also used the PP entry assay to evaluate the therapeutic effects of entry inhibitors towards the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Thus spike proteins from newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants can be rapidly evaluated with this surrogate assay for viral entry.</p>

The compounds were dissolved as 10 mM DMSO stock solutions, and titrated at 1:5 for primary screens with 4 concentration points. The SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay and ATP content cytotoxicity assay in HEK293-ACE2 cells, were used to screen the NPC and MIPE libraries in parallel. The primary screens assayed four compound concentrations at the single point. Hit compounds were cherry picked, titrated at 1:3 for follow up assays with 11 concentrations, in duplicates.

Two of the three plasmids, pCMV-MLVgag-pol and and pTG-Luc were same as previously described <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, and the third plasmid for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was newly generated. The PPs produced by the co-transfection carry SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on their bilayer surface, and package firefly luciferase RNA instead of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Thus, the PPs are only capable of a single round of entry into host cells via ACE2 receptor-mediated entry, and cannot replicate in cells. PP entry is complete when membrane fusion and luciferase RNA is released into the cell. After a 48 hr incubation period to allow for luciferase expression, the amount of PP entry could be read out via a luciferase enzyme assay with a luminescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay optimization and miniaturization</title>
<p id="P19">Binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor on cell membrane is the first step of viral entry into cells. An Expi293F cell line stably expressing human ACE2 (HEK293-ACE2) was used for this SARS-CoV-2 PP assay <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. After inoculation, the PPs entered cells and released luciferase RNA that resulted in expression of luciferase reporter enzyme. The luminescence signal, an indicator of the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, was then detected. Cells treated with bald PPs, i.e. PPs lacking fusion glycoproteins, were used as a basal signal control. PPs pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) were used as a control in PP production and entry assays. VSV-G is a class III fusion protein that binds host LDL receptor family members, and mediates cell entry of PPs pseudotyped with VSV-G. It is commonly used as a control in viral pseudotyping due to its wide range of cellular tropism <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The entry assay with VSV-G PPs was used to eliminate entry inhibitors in our compound screens operating via the MLV components of the PP, rather than the SARS-CoV-2 components. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, HEK293-ACE2 cells inoculated with VSV-G PPs showed a signal-to-basal ratio (S/B) of 776-fold compared with the basal signal generated by bald PPs that do not contain fusion glycoproteins. Bald PPs produced a slight increase in luciferase signal when compared with no PP medium control, with RLU values of 4.7 and 2.7 for bald PP and no PP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, inoculation with bald PP was used as a negative control in all experiments. Consistent with previous reports, we found that cells treated with PPs bearing SARS-CoV-2-S with C-terminal 19 amino acid truncation (ΔC19) showed enhanced S/B ratio than full length (FL) spike <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>, with S/B ratio of 1178 and 47.8 fold for PPs with ΔC19 spike and FL spike, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, all subsequent PP experiments were carried out with the ΔC19 spike construct, which henceforth will be referred to as the SARS-CoV-2-S PP.</p>
<p id="P20">To confirm the expression and incorporation of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the PPs, we carried out negative stain transmission electron microscopy with immunogold labeling of spike. The electron micrographs showed the presence of a spiky fringe decorating the surface of PPs that labeled with immunogold directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). To understand the level of PP transduction, we conducted immunofluorescent staining of the luciferase enzyme in the HEK293-ACE2 cells treated with the PPs and found a significantly greater expression of luciferase reporter proteins in the SARS-CoV-2-S and VSV-G PPs treated cells compared to bald PP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). These results correlate well with whole-well based luciferase assay signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Together, these results indicate a significant increase in luciferase luminescence after inoculating HEK293-ACE2 cells with PPs carrying SARS-CoV-2-S ΔC19.</p>
<p id="P21">We then miniaturized the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay to the 1536-well plate format for HTS by proportionally reducing the quantity of cells and reagents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A seeding density of 1500 cells per well resulted in approximately 80% confluence after an overnight incubation, which is the standard confluence for pseudovirus assays. The S/B ratio was 129-fold, CV was 19.5%, and Z’ factor was 0.40 in the 1536-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). These values indicated that this assay was acceptable for HTS.</p>

<sec id="S15">
<title>Quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) using the SARS-CoV-2 PP assay</title>
<p id="P22">A qHTS was performed using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay in the 1536-well plate format. A total of 5,158 compounds, containing approved drugs, drug candidates, and mechanism-based bioactive compounds were screened at four assay concentrations (0.46, 2.30, 11.5, 57.5 μM). Due to the fact that this was a signal decrease assay and required a 48 hr incubation, cytotoxic compounds could have appeared as false positives by reducing luciferase luminescence because of cell death. Therefore, an ATP content cell viability assay was carried out in parallel with the same cells and assay protocol, without the addition of PP, to filter out the cytotoxic compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">The primary screening data was analyzed using an in-house curve fitting software and the primary hits were selected based on a cut-off values of EC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μM and maximal inhibition &gt; 65% with a delta AUC (area-under-the-curve difference between PP assay and cytotoxicity counter-screen) greater than 60. A set of 382 compounds were selected as the primary hits that were freshly QC’ed and retested in the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay using an 11-point concentration titration (1:3 dilution). In addition, a VSV-G PP entry assay was employed as an additional counter-screen to eliminate false positive hits that inhibit luciferase expression or luciferase enzymatic activity instead of spike-mediated cell entry. From these three confirmation and counter-screen assays, seven specific inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry were identified that show &gt;10-fold selectivity between SARS-CoV-2-S and VSV-G PP entry assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). All data from the primary screen and follow up assays were publicly posted on PubChem (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), as well as the NCATS OpenData Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/">https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="S16">
<title>Hit confirmation in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay</title>
<p id="P24">To further confirm the entry inhibition activity, the seven selective entry inhibitors were tested in a SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection assay, by measuring cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The results in this live virus assay confirmed that six compounds showed a protective effect against the cell death caused by the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), while the activity dichlorophen was not confirmed in the CPE assay, possibly due to cell line differences.</p>
<p id="P25">In conclusion, six compounds were identified as the specific inhibitors against viral entry into host cells mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Among these compounds, the SARS-CoV-2 CPE rescue was confirmed for six compounds.</p>

<sec id="S17">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 PP assay with mutations from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants</title>
<p id="P26">To evaluate the applicability of this PP entry assay to spike variants, variant spike proteins from the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) strains were used to pseudotype MLV PPs. The 6 entry inhibitors that were confirmed in the CPE assay were tested in 3 SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assays, with the original Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence, and two variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike sequences, as well as an ATP content cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The potency and efficacy of each of the six compounds in the PP entry assays were not significantly affected by these spike variants. All but one compound had EC50’s that were within 3-fold for each variant. Apilimod showed EC<sub>50</sub>’s of 9.2 nM, 1.3 nM and 4.7 nM in Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assays, with a 7-fold shift in potency between the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence and the B.1.1.7 spike variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P27">For highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, BSL-2 assays such as pseudotyped viral particle assays and virus-like particle (VLP) assays are commonly used for HTS of compound collections for drug development <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. The requirement of BSL-3 or BLS-4 facilities for live virus experiments could be a limiting factor for drug development. Therefore, here we report the design and development of an alternative BSL-2 containment level assay using SARS-CoV-2 PPs. The SARS-CoV-2 PPs consisted of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein incorporated in an enclosed bilayer membrane, packaged by MLV gag-pol core polyproteins, and enclosign luciferase reporter RNA. The incubation of SARS-CoV-2-S PPs with HEK293-ACE2 cells allows entry and expression of luciferase reporter gene in host cells that can be detected by luciferase reporter activity. Much like host cell entry of replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus, the entry of SARS-CoV-2-S PPs are mediated by spike protein interaction with host ACE2 receptor, cleavage of spike protein by host proteases to enable the triggering of conformational changes to the spike protein required for membrane fusion. These activities are dependent not only on interactions of spike protein with host cell receptor and proteases, but also on host cell endocytic machinery, and are therefore, highly cell type specific <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, PP entry assays are phenotypic assays that can be used to screen multiple targets involved in viral cell entry.</p>
<p id="P28">This SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry assay is robust for compound screening in the 1536-well plate format, and is a good tool for HTS efforts for COVID-19 drug development. This assay can also be used to deconvolute mechanisms of action of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hits from live SARS-CoV-2 screens to identify compounds that act on viral entry versus viral replication. Viral pseudotyped assays have been commonly used to examine neutralization activity of antibodies and other biologics that block spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. However, unlike testing neutralizing antibodies, which have a clear target and mechanism of action, there is less certainty about the molecular target and the mechanism of inhibition when screening cell penetrant small molecules, which introduces additional mechanisms for false positives, such as inhibition of luciferase reporter expression. In our primary screen, some of the highly potent hits were known reverse transcriptase inhibitors (adefovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and integrase inhibitors (elvitegravir and dolutegravir), that were clearly functioning through inhibition of the MLV retroviral core proteins. These hits showed the same potency in the VSV-G PP entry counter assay, and were thus weeded out. However, use of VSV-G PP as a counter screen might be overly stringent, because while SARS-CoV-2-S and VSV-G have different host receptors and protease requirements, there are known entry mechanisms that are shared between the two glycoproteins. One such shared mechanism is binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan to facilitate cell attachment <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Future studies might feature viral-like particles (VLP), which directly tag viral packaging proteins with an enzyme protein reporter, and therefore eliminate the process of RNA reporter expression <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. However, successful SARS-CoV-2-S VLP generation with reporter enzyme has yet to be reported.</p>
<p id="P29">In the drug repurposing screen using this SARS-CoV-2-P PP entry assay, seven selective entry inhibitors were found including VBY-825, aloxistatin, apilimod, calpeptin, dichlorophen, brigatinib, and CAA-0225. Their activities against SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells have been previously reported in the literature <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. We also further examined their activity on the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in confirmation of six compounds in the live virus assay, with the exception of dichlorophen (antiparasitic and antimicrobial agent) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Four out of the six confirmed hits are known inhibitors of host proteases and block priming of spike protein after spike-ACE2 binding. VBY-825 is a potent cathepsin inhibitor originally developed for cancer therapy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Aloxistatin is a cysteine protease inhibitor developed for treatment of muscular dystrophy but the clinical trial was not successful <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Calpeptin is a potent peptide inhibitor of cathepsin K and calpain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. CAA-0225 is a potent peptide cathepsin L inhibitor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Brigatinib is a dual kinase inhibitor that targets mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and is an approved drug for cancer therapy. Apilimod is an approved drug for autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, through inhibitions of production of IL-12 and IL-23 and PIKfyve (a lipid kinase) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the antiviral activities of Apilimod against SARS-CoV-2, Lassa fever, and Ebola have been reported <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. It is worth mentioning that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is highly cell type dependent <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. While our screen identified compounds that are more specific to the SARS-CoV-2-S mediated entry pathway over the VSV-G mediated pathway, any host cell directed inhibitors might show different potencies and/or efficacies in other cell types. For instance, the known cathepsin inhibitor hits (VBY-825, aloxistatin, calpeptin and CAA-0225), would not be active against SARS-CoV-2 entry in cells, which uses a TMPRSS2 protease dependent pathway instead of cathepsin dependent pathway, such as Calu-3 cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">Similar to many RNA viruses, mutations in the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 occur frequently. Variants of concern (VOC) that either cause increased infectivity or vaccine escape due to multiple spike protein mutations are actively being tracked (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html</ext-link>). Several mutations have been reported in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that have raised some concern about the efficacy of current vaccines drugs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. One advantage of the PP assay reported here is the ease of swapping spike protein plasmids, i.e. in SARS-CoV-2 PP production cells, the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike plasmid can be rapidly replaced with a plasmid containing any of the newly identified spike variant constructs. To illustrate this, we have generated PPs with mutations in spike protein from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, and conducted pilot experiments to test the top entry inhibitor hits from the repurposing screen. Therefore, th SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay reported here, with facile and rapid modifications, can be used to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of therapeutics (binding and entry inhibitors) on new variants with mutations in spike protein. It is a valid <italic>in vitro</italic> model for testing drugs against emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations.</p>
