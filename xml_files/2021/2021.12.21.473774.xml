<abstract>
<p id="P1">Phagocytic responses by effector cells to antibody or complement-opsonised viruses have been recognized to play a key role in anti-viral immunity. These include antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis mediated via Fc-receptors, phagocytosis mediated by classically activated complementfixing IgM or IgG1 antibodies and antibody independent phagocytosis mediated via direct opsonisation of viruses by complement products activated via the mannose-binding lectin pathway. Limited data suggest these phagocytic responses by effector cells may contribute to the immunological and inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, their development and clinical significance remain to be fully elucidated. In this cohort of 62 patients, acutely ill individuals were shown to mount phagocytic responses to autologous plasma-opsonised SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-coated microbeads as early as 10 days post symptom onset. Heat inactivation of the plasma prior to use as an opsonin caused 77-95% abrogation of the phagocytic response, and pre-blocking of Fc-receptors on the effector cells showed only 18-60% inhibition. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke early phagocytosis, which is primarily driven by heat labile components, likely activated complements, with variable contribution from anti-Spike antibodies. During convalescence, phagocytic responses correlated significantly with anti-Spike IgG titers. Older patients and patients with severe disease had significantly higher phagocytosis and neutralisation functions when compared to younger patients or patients with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. A longitudinal study of a subset of these patients over 12 months showed preservation of phagocytic and neutralisation functions in all patients, despite a drop in the endpoint antibody titers by more than 90%. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance showed a significant increase in the affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies over time correlating with the maintenance of both the phagocytic and neutralisation functions suggesting that improvement in the antibody quality over the 12 months contributed to the retention of effector functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Since emerging in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly worldwide infecting over 265 million individuals with over five million deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. To understand disease pathogenesis and immune correlates of protection, detailed characterisation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 both during the acute phase and longitudinally is required including in patients varying in age and disease severity.</p>
<p id="P3">Early polyfunctional T cell, B cell and antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 are associated with reduced clinical severity and better disease outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. At the beginning of the pandemic there was much controversy over the protective capacity of antibodies in coronavirus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In rodent models, neutralising antibodies were demonstrated to block infection of SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, neutralisation alone may be insufficient for protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], whereas the combination of neutralising antibodies with Fc receptor dependent effector functions may reduce disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p>
<p id="P4">Limited data suggest that phagocytic responses by effector cells to antibody-or complement-opsonised viruses may play a key role in the immunological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. These include the association of antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) with protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], correlation of earlier IgG class switching and maintenance of Fc receptor binding properties with reduction in disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. By contrast, phagocytosis mediated by classically activated complement-fixing IgM antibodies has been associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], and antibody independent phagocytosis mediated by complement products activated via the mannose-binding lectin pathway were associated with a hyperinflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. However, the kinetics of development of these phagocytic responses, their maintenance, and their clinical significance remain to be fully elucidated. In particular, little is known about the phagocytic responses during acute disease, and the long-term retention of these functions and the associated predictive factors in convalescent patients beyond five months are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Importantly, studies to date used purified patient antibodies or cloned monoclonal antibodies to detect phagocytosis and so disregarded potentially significant contribution of plasma proteins such as activated complements that are relevant in phagocytic responses against respiratory pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p>
<p id="P5">In this study acutely ill patients with COVID-19 mounted phagocytic responses to autologous plasma-opsonised-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-coated microbeads as early as 10 days post symptom onset, independent of disease severity and despite variable levels of anti-Spike antibody titers. Heat inactivation of the plasma prior to use as an opsonin caused 77–95% abrogation of the phagocytic response and blocking of the Fc-receptors revealed 18–60% inhibition. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke early phagocytosis which is primarily driven by heat labile components in the plasma with variable contribution from anti-Spike antibodies. In convalescent patients, there was an increase in phagocytosis which correlated significantly with higher anti-Spike IgG titers and with antibody mediated neutralisation. Older patients and patients with severe disease had significantly higher phagocytic responses when compared to younger patients and patients with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. This age and disease severity dependent difference in the anti-Spike antibody dependent phagocytosis mirrored the anti-Spike neutralisation activity. There was no significant difference in phagocytic responses between men and women. Longitudinally, phagocytosis and neutralisation functions were still detectable at the 12-month timepoint, in parallel with a significant increase in affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies, despite an over 90% decline of the endpoint antibody titers. These findings suggest that improved quality of the antibodies, likely due to somatic hypermutation, may play a major role in the preservation of these effector functions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Study cohort</title>
<p id="P6">Antibody assays were performed on plasma and serum samples collected from 62 participants that included six acutely ill (two females, median age 52.5 [range: 14-79] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and 56 convalescent patients (25 females, median age 53 [range: 19-94] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">For the acutely ill patients, samples were collected 10-25 days post symptom onset (DPS) (median: 20 DPS) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and for patients in convalescence, samples were collected on days 10-99 DPS (median: 59.5 DPS) (visit 1). In a subset of the convalescent patients (n=9), longitudinal samples were collected on 110-252 DPS (median: 150 DPS) (visit 2) and on 329-381 DPS (median: 345 DPS) (visit 3), respectively. Among the convalescent patients, five were asymptomatic, 16 had mild, 17 had moderate and 18 had severe disease, and all groups had comparable median DPS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, the median age for the patients with severe disease was higher (66 years) while for those with moderate disease was much lower (34 years) than the overall median age of 53 years. The male to female ratio (1.2:1) of the cohort was representative of the epidemic, however in the severe disease group males were over-represented at a ratio of 2.6 to 1 and under-represented in patients with mild disease in a ratio of 1 to 2.2 (Supplementary Table 1). At the time of collection of the 12-month samples, Australia had limited community transmission following the first wave in 2020 when these participants were infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Although the specific SARS-CoV-2 variants in these patients were not genotyped, all predate infections with the Delta and Omicron variants. None of these participants had received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time of sampling. A detailed description of the patients is shown in Supplementary Table 1.</p>

<title>Early detection of heat labile phagocytosis in acutely ill patients</title>
<p id="P8">Plasma from all six acutely ill participants demonstrated detectable phagocytosis of microbeads coated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as early as 10 days post symptom onset regardless of disease severity, and despite 2/6 having no detectable anti-Spike antibody end point titers (EPTs, see methods?) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The gating strategy used to determine the proportion of positive cells and their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), as well as microscopic validation for intracellular uptake of the opsonised microbeads is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>. In the patients (n = 4) with detectable anti-Spike antibodies, the mean EPTs was 11015, 95% CI [-6490, 28500] with mean Spike phagocytosis score (p-score, see Methods) of 51.4, 95% CI [18.2, 84.6]. For the 2/6 patients with undetectable EPTs, the Spike p-scores were markedly lower (2.38, 95% CI [1.15, 3.61]), whereas the background cut-off in samples from unexposed healthy control subjects was 0.9, 95% CI [0.518, 1.28] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Although the number of the acutely ill patients is limited, those with high Spike p-scores had low viral loads, whereas individuals with low p-scores had relatively high viral loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). However, there was no correlation between the anti-Spike EPTs and Spike p-scores (Spearman’s r = 0.8, p = 0.07, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting contribution from other components of the plasma including the heat labile complements. To confirm this, plasma from these patients was heat inactivated prior to use as an opsonin and found a profound abrogation of phagocytosis by 77–95% in 5/6 of patients (mean Spike p-score 5.7, 95% CI [-5.5, 16.9]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). By contrast, Fc receptor blocking experiments indicated that anti-Spike antibodies in the plasma of these patients contributed to 18-60% of the phagocytic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). Interestingly, in one patient (Patient #1) with the undetectable anti-Spike antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>), blocking of the Fc receptor showed 60.3% inhibition of phagocytosis suggesting the presence of small amounts of effective anti-Spike antibodies that were not detected by endpoint titration in ELISA. To test this further, binding assay using surface plasmon resonance were performed and revealed extremely high affinity binding of the plasma to recombinant Spike protein (KD = 4×10<sup>−12</sup>M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>) supporting the notion of low titre high affinity antibodies.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Disease severity dependent differences in phagocytosis, endpoint antibody titers and neutralisation function at convalescence</title>
<p id="P9">Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody EPT in sera collected during convalescence in the 10-99 DPS window (n=56) showed that 100% had detectable anti-Spike IgG and 98% had anti-RBD IgG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A-B</xref>). Further analysis of the IgG subclasses of the anti-Spike responses showed that the antibodies were primarily IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes, but not IgG2 or IgG4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). There was also variable levels of anti-Spike IgA and IgM antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Functionally, 95% (53/56) of all patient samples demonstrated significant phagocytosis of Spike protein-coated microbeads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>), 84% (47/56) had phagocytosis of RBD protein-coated microbeads, albeit at lower phagocytic scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>), and 86% (48/56) could neutralise Spike pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Stratification by disease severity into asymptomatic (n=5), mild (n=16), moderate (n=17) or severe (n=18) disease showed a severity dependent increase in anti-Spike antibody EPTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A and 2C</xref>). A significant difference in anti-Spike antibody EPTs was observed in between disease severity groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] = 12.61, p = 0.005), whereas the severe group had significantly higher anti-Spike antibody EPT than the mild (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.006) and moderate (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.04) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). There was no significant difference in anti-RBD antibody EPT among disease severity groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Multiple comparison of the anti-Spike antibody subtypes among disease severity groups showed higher anti-Spike IgG1 (Kruskal-Wallis test, mild versus severe: p = 0.04 and moderate versus severe: p = 0.03), whereas difference between other subtypes were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). There was also a significant difference in Spike p-scores between the disease severity groups [ANOVA, F (3, 52) = 5.695, p = 0.001]. In particular, the severe disease group has significantly higher Spike p-scores compared to the moderate (mean difference = -454.9, 95% CI = -885.3 to -24.38, p = 0.03) and mild disease groups (mean difference = -650.6, 95% CI = -1088 to -213.3, p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). Similarly, a significant difference in RBD p-scores was evident between severe and mild disease groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). The neutralisation titers were also significantly different between disease severity groups [ANOVA, F (3, 52) = 4.545, p = 0.006] with the severe disease group having a significantly higher neutralisation titre compared to the moderate (mean difference = -440.8, 95% CI = -889.8 to 8.122, p = 0.049) and mild disease groups (mean difference = -586.5, 95% CI = -1043 to -130.4, p = 0.006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>Age dependent differences in phagocytosis, endpoint antibody titers and neutralisation function at convalescence</title>
<p id="P11">Analysis of the age stratified groups: &gt;60 years (n=24), 40-60 years (n=14), &lt;40 years (n=18) showed that anti-Spike antibody EPTs were significantly different between the age groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] = 13.6, p = 0.001). Patients &gt;60 years of age had higher anti-Spike antibody EPTs compared to the 40–60-year-old group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.02) and the &lt;40-year old patient group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). By contrast, there was no difference in the anti-RBD antibody EPT between the age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Examination of the anti-Spike antibody classes and IgG subtypes revealed significant difference between the age groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] = 162.3, p = 0.0001). There were higher anti-Spike IgG1 in the &gt;60-years old group when compared to the &lt;40-year-old group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.0007), and significantly higher IgG3 in the &gt;60 year group when compared to 40–60 year old group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.007). The anti-Spike IgG2 and IgG4 levels were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>) and there was no significant difference in Spike p-score or RBD p-score between the different age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D-E</xref>).

<title>Ranking of the association of independent variables of importance to anti-Spike antibody mediated phagocytosis</title>
<p id="P12">Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to rank all the independent variables of importance that associated with the dependent variable (Spike p-score). Anti-Spike endpoint titre was the most important variable that predicted the Spike p-score (change in R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), while the rest of the variables are listed in descending order of predictive value in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. A parameter covariance matrix was plotted to determine the associative relationships between the non-categorical independent variable to yield the dependent variable Spike p-score, revealing that anti-Spike IgG1 and IgG3 associated positively with most independent variables, whereas age and DPS associated negatively or poorly with other variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

Although neutralisation titre significantly correlated with anti-Spike EPT (Spearman’s r = 0.64, p = 0.0001) and anti-RBD EPT (Spearman’s r = 0.34, p = 0.009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C-D</xref>), it did not correlate with DPS. Stratification of patient group by disease severity indicated that patients with moderate disease had the most significant correlation of the Spike p-score to the anti-Spike EPTs (Spearman r = 0.71, p = 0.001), and to the neutralisation titre (Spearman r = 0.60, p=0.0007), while samples from individuals in the severe disease category had no significant correlation among the variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Maintenance of anti-Spike phagocytosis and neutralisation functions and increase in affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies despite decline of the endpoint antibody titers from baseline over 12-months follow-up</title>
<p id="P15">Further longitudinal study of nine convalescent patients showed a significant decline of anti-Spike IgG EPT [χ<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] = 18, p = 0.0001], Spike p-score [χ<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] = 12.6, p = 0.0007], and neutralisation function [χ<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] = 8, p = 0.01] from visit 1 (one month post symptom onset) to visit 3 (12 months post symptom onset)] regardless of disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A-C</xref>). The anti-Spike EPT significantly decreased from visit 1 to visit 3 (Friedmann test, visit 1-visit 3, p = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>).

The neutralisation titre also decreased significantly from visit 1 to visit 3 (Friedmann test, visit 1-visit 3, p = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). Although the anti-Spike EPT declined by an average of 91.2% (standard error of mean (SEM): 1.43) from visit 1 to visit 3, there was better maintenance of the Spike p-score and neutralisation titre, which showed 65.3% ± 9.27 SEM and 41.8% ± 39.2 SEM decline on average, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, the surface plasmon resonance studies showed up to 840-fold increase in the affinity (KD) of the anti-Spike antibodies to Spike protein in 8/9 patient plasma samples (mean = 150-fold increase; range 3.3–836.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E-F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P30">The studies reported here demonstrated that acutely ill patients with COVD-19 can mount phagocytic responses mediated by heat labile components of the plasma as early as 10 days post symptom onset, regardless of disease severity and anti-Spike end point antibody titers. COVID-19 disease severity was also found to be associated with increased phagocytic responses in patients that recovered from COVID-19 disease. Importantly also, this report reveals for the first time that affinity of anti-Spike antibodies in convalescent patient samples increased over the 12-month period leading to retention of the phagocytic and neutralisation functions, despite a marked decline in the antibody titers.</p>
<p id="P31">Studies to date have used antibodies purified from patient samples, or cloned monoclonal antibodies, to detect phagocytosis, revealing a narrow pattern of antibody dependent phagocytosis without recognition of significant contribution of plasma proteins such as activated complement products that are recognised to be critical in phagocytic responses against other respiratory pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. By contrast, in this study, native patient plasma was used revealing that the early phagocytic response in SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily driven by heat labile components in the plasma, along with a contribution from Fc-receptor dependent antibody functions. Further, the studies revealed that samples from acutely ill patients may have significant anti-Spike antibody mediated phagocytosis activity, despite having undetectable antibody titers. These findings suggest that like other respiratory viral infections, the most important heat labile components of plasma contributing to viral phagocytosis are the classically activated complement products that upon interaction with complement-fixing IgM and IgG1 can lead to enhanced phagocytosis through interactions with Fc and complement receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], or by direct opsonisation of viruses by complement proteins activated via the mannose-binding lectin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p>
<p id="P32">There is ample evidence to support the association between complement activation through the classical, lectin and alternate pathways and clinical severity in COVID-19, including strong links to worsened disease severity and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, it has also been shown that anti-Spike antibodies from patients with acute COVID-19 can initiate tissue deposition of complement that may initiate tissue injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Our finding that blocking of the Fc-receptors can only partially abrogate the phagocytic response, supports the notion of collaborative effects between complement proteins and the Fc-receptor specific antibody functions. Enhancement of phagocytosis by complement may trigger Fc-receptor- and complement receptor-mediated excessive activation of phagocytic effector cells leading to the hyperinflammatory state likely underpinning the severe disease observed in some members of the cohort. This collaborative response may also contribute to more effective viral elimination leading to the sometimes favourable clinical outcome, as observed by Federica et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p>
<p id="P33">Although the observations in acutely ill patients are potentially clinically significant, the limited numbers available from this early stage of the disease preclude definitive conclusions, hence further studies in a larger cohort are warranted. By contrast, in the convalescent patients phagocytosis strongly correlated with anti-Spike antibody endpoint titers, neutralisation functions and severe disease. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most important variable related to a high phagocytic response was anti-Spike antibody endpoint titre. Further, older patients mounted significantly higher neutralisation activity and had higher antibody endpoint titers, while gender had little impact on the phagocytic function. These results are consistent with recent studies in which disease severity and age were identified as major contributors to endpoint antibody titers and their neutralisation functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. While co-morbidities may have contributed to disease severity in the older patients studied here, it is also possible that pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against other common coronaviruses may have led to consistently higher anti-Spike antibody titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], that in turn may explain the higher phagocytic responses. Future, longitudinal characterisation of phagocytic and neutralisation functions of anti-Spike antibodies against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their functional cross-reactivity to the earlier variants are warranted.</p>
<p id="P34">To date, phagocytic activity in SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be maintained for 5 months post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The findings in the longitudinal study reported here indicated retention of both phagocytic and neutralisation functions for over 12 months, despite a progressive decline in anti-Spike antibody endpoint titers. While the progressive decline of the antibody titers is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], the data presented here show for the first time, a significant increase in the anti-Spike antibody affinity over time, which may have contributed to the retention of the effector functions despite the decay of the endpoint titers to baseline. This finding concurs with longitudinal B cell studies that have reported ongoing affinity maturation and improved affinity of SARS-Cov-2 specific memory B cell receptors up to 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Importantly, this report is the first study to demonstrate antibodies in the circulation showing functional improvement correlating with the functional characteristics observed in memory B cells. These new results have potential clinical implications. They challenge current clinical practice that considers measurement of the anti-Spike antibody titers but not their quality as one of the gold standard indicators of immune protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Change in practice that includes routine measurement of the quality and functions of these antibodies is therefore highly recommended.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>

<p>Limited data suggest antibody dependent effector functions including phagocytosis may contribute to the immunological and inflammatory responses in SARS CoV-2 infection, however, their development, maintenance, and clinical significance remain unknown. In this study we show:
<list list-type="order" id="L">
<list-item>
<p>Patients with acute SARS CoV-2 infection can mount phagocytic responses as early as 10 days post symptom onset and these responses were primarily driven by heat labile components of the autologous plasma. These results indicate that the current approach of studying phagocytosis using purified or monoclonal antibodies does not recapitulate contribution by all components in the plasma.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In convalescent patients, high phagocytic responses significantly correlated with increasing age, increasing disease severity, high neutralisation functions and high anti-Spike antibody titers, particularly IgG1.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Longitudinal study of convalescent patients over a 12-month period showed maintenance of phagocytic and neutralisation functions, despite a drop in the anti-Spike endpoint antibody titers by more than 90%. However, we found significant increase in the affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies over the 12-month period and these correlated with the maintenance of functions suggesting that improvement in the antibody quality over time contributed to the retention of effector functions. Clinically, measuring antibody titers in sera but not the quality of antibodies is considered a gold standard indicator of immune protection following SARS-CoV 2 infection or vaccination. Our results challenge this notion and recommends change in the current clinical practice.</p>

<title>Detection of heat labile Spike phagocytosis in acutely ill patients with COVID-19.</title>
<p>(A) A histogram showing positive Spike phagocytosis scores was detected in all acutely sick patients despite varying anti-Spike antibody EPTs (black dots), differences in DPS onset and disease severity; positive phagocytosis is defined as three standard deviations above the mean a phagocytosis scores of healthy controls (dotted line). (B) Viral load in plasma at the time of sample collection (DPS) among the patients. (C) Spearman correlation study showing a trend of positive correlation between Spike antibody EPTs and Spike p-scores despite the small sample size (n = 6, r = 0.8, p = 0.07). (D) Heat inactivation of the plasma caused a profound abrogation of Spike p-score by 77-95% in 5/6 of the patients with acute infection (mean Spike p-score 5.7, 95% CI [-5.5, 16.9]), suggesting major contribution by heat labile components of the plasma. (E) Fc receptor blocking experiments with untreated plasma indicated that the antibodies contributed to 18-60% (mean Spike p-score 17.82, 95% CI [-0.58, 36.2]) of the phagocytic function all acute patients. (F) Surface plasmon resonance showing high affinity binding of plasma obtained from patient #1 to recombinant Spike protein (KD = 4×10<sup>−12</sup>M) despite having undetectable anti-Spike antibody (A) and minimal Fc-receptor dependent phagocytosis (E).</p>

<title>Disease severity dependent differences in endpoint antibody titers, phagocytosis and neutralisation titre at convalescence.</title>
<p>(A) Disease severity dependent increase in anti-Spike antibody EPTs in plasma of patients was significant in patients with severe disease when compared to moderate (difference of mean = 64498.1, 95% CI [-7340, 66700]), mild (difference of mean = 85558.5, 95% CI [1550, 15600]); B) Anti-RBD antibody EPTs showing high level expression in all patients but there was no significant difference among the various patient groups. (C) Analysis of the anti-Spike antibody classes and IgG subtypes showed IgG1 as the major antibody subtype contributing to the significant increase in the anti-Spike EPTs in the patients with severe disease. (D) Severe disease group has significantly higher Spike p-score compared to moderate (difference of mean = -454.9, 95% CI [-885.3, -24.38]) and mild diseased group (difference of mean = -650.6, 95% CI [-1088, -213.3]. (E) Anti-RBD antibodies-mediated phagocytic response was significantly higher in the severe when compared to mild (difference of mean = 0.6, 95% CI [4.34, 7.02]) diseased individuals. (F) Severe disease group has significantly higher neutralisation titre compared to moderate (difference of mean = -440.8, 95% CI [-889.8, 8.122]) and mild diseased group (difference of mean = -586.5, 95% CI [-1043, -130.4]); F) Dotted lines in each plot show median or mean values+3SD of 25 healthy control samples (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001).</p>

(B) However, there is no statistical difference in the anti-RBD EPT among the age groups. (C) Higher anti-Spike IgG1 among &gt;60-years old group was found when compared to &lt;40-years old (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.0007) and significantly higher IgG3 among &gt;60-years old group when compared to 40–60year old (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.007). (D&amp;E) Neither the Spike p-score nor RBD p-score was statistically different among the age groups. (F) Neutralisation titre was significantly higher in the &gt;60-year old patients when compared to the &lt;40 (difference of mean = 382.2, 95% CI [58.4, 152]); Dotted lines in each plot show median or mean values +3SD of 25 healthy control samples (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001).</p>

<title>Correlation of Spike p-score to endpoint antibody titre and neutralisation titre in patients with varying disease severity.</title>
<p>(A) Spearman correlation studies of all 56 convalescent patients showed significant positive correlation of Spike phagocytic scores with anti-Spike antibody EPTs and (B) the Spike pseudovirus neutralisation. (C) Stratification of the patients by disease severity indicated that patients with moderate disease had the most significant correlation of the Spike phagocytosis to the anti-Spike antibody EPTs and to the Spike pseudovirus neutralisation while patients at both ends of the spectrum had least significant correlation. Patients with moderate disease also displayed significant positive correlation of the neutralisation titre with the anti-Spike antibody EPTs (D) anti-RBD antibody EPTs and (E) days post symptom onset. (r and p values are shown in text and in supplementary Table 2).</p>

<title>Correlation of Spike p-score to endpoint antibody titre and neutralisation titre in different age group patients.</title>
<p>(A) Stratification of the convalescent patients by age into &lt;40 years, 40–60 years and &gt;60 years of age showed no significant correlation of the Spike phagocytosis to anti-Spike antibody EPTs in any of the age groups. (B) However, there was significant but variable correlation of the Spike phagocytosis to the Spike neutralisation titre in each age group. (C) All age groups showed significant correlation of their neutralisation titre to the anti-Spike EPTs. (D) Only the 40–60-year-old patients showed significant correlation of the neutralisation titre to anti-RBD antibody EPTs (r and p values are shown in text and supplementary Table 2).</p>

<title>Longitudinal study of anti-Spike antibodies EPTs, Spike phagocytosis, Spike neutralisation titre and affinity of plasma anti-Spike antibodies.</title>
<p>Longitudinal study of nine convalescent patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease (n=3 each) showing significant time-dependent decline of (A) anti-Spike IgG antibodies endpoint titers, (B) Spike phagocytosis, and (C) anti-Spike neutralisation titre over a 12-months period regardless of their disease severity. (D) The anti-Spike EPT declined by average 91.2% (standard error of mean (SEM): 1.43) from visit 1 to visit 3, but there was substantial retention of the Spike p-score and neutralisation titre, which showed 65.3% ± 9.27 SEM and 41.8% ± 39.2 SEM decline on average, respectively. (E-F) Surface plasmon resonance showing increase in the affinity (K<sub>
