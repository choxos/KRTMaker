These prokaryotic groups have distinct cellular systems including fundamentally different phospholipid membrane bilayers. This dichotomy has been termed the lipid divide and possibly bestows different biophysical and biochemical characteristics on each cell type. Classic experiments suggest that bacterial membranes (formed from lipids extracted from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for example) show permeability to key metabolites comparable to archaeal membranes (formed from lipids extracted from <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>), yet systematic analyses based on direct measurements of membrane permeability are absent. Here we develop a new approach for assessing the membrane permeability of ~10 μm unilamellar vesicles, consisting of an aqueous medium enclosed by a single lipid bilayer. Comparing the permeability of eighteen metabolites demonstrates that diether glycerol-1-phosphate lipids with methyl branches, often the most abundant membrane lipids of known archaea, are permeable to a wide range of compounds useful for core metabolic networks, including amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. Permeability is significantly lower in diester glycerol-3-phosphate lipids without methyl branches, the common building block of bacterial membranes. To identify the membrane characteristics that determine permeability we use this experimental platform to test a variety of lipid forms bearing a diversity of intermediate characteristics. We found that increased membrane permeability is dependent on both the methyl branches present on the archaeal phospholipid tails and the ether bond between the tails and the head group. These permeability differences must have had profound effects on the cell physiology and proteome evolution of early prokaryotic forms. To explore this further, we compare the abundance and distribution of transmembrane transporter-encoding protein families present on genomes sampled from across the prokaryotic tree of life. Archaea have a reduced repertoire of transporter gene families, consistent with increased membrane permeation. These results demonstrate that the lipid divide demarcates a clear difference in permeability function with implications for understanding some of the earliest transitions in cell evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Membranes are the boundaries that define cells. At some stage in early evolution, a molecular system must have become encapsulated within a lipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] with functions that allowed metabolites to permeate the membrane and provide substrates for the molecular system to function. How metabolites cross membranes is therefore a key factor for understanding early evolution. Several key steps later, the prokaryotes emerged, cellular forms which include the Bacteria (once called Eubacteria) and the Archaea (once called Archaebacteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The placement of the root of the prokaryotes is debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], making it difficult to understand the biology of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). However, the Archaea/Bacteria bifurcation, which could represent LUCA, marks multiple important differences in cell biology. The consequences of these differences are key to understanding how the Archaea and Bacteria emerged.</p><p id="P4">Bacteria and Archaea possess homologous ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and ribosomal RNA components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], yet, Bacteria and Archaea possess distinct cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], DNA replication machineries (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]), chromatin structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and phospholipid membrane chemistries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. This latter distinction, termed the lipid divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], is an important evolutionary factor. Archaeal and bacterial phospholipid bilayers are assembled via distinct biosynthetic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Most Bacteria possess membranes of fatty-acid chains bonded to a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone via ester bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In contrast, mesophilic archaeal membranes are predominantly constructed from diether lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] with isoprenoid chains containing methyl branches bonded to a glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P) backbone via ether bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] (known as archaeol). These lipids often represent the abundant lipid forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] but both Bacteria and Archaea are able to synthesize a large diversity of structurally distinct lipids often in response to different environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. For example, Archaea can increase the abundance of bipolar lipids (also known as tetraether caldarchaeol) in response to high temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The main function of cell membranes is to generate a semi-permeable solute barrier that allows for the development of chemical and proton gradients that drive the biochemistry and energetics of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The core difference between the G3P diester lipids of Bacteria and G1P diether lipids with methyl branches of Archaea could have a profound effect on the primary function of the cell membrane. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have identified important biological implications of the physico-chemical properties of phospholipid membranes by using liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Liposomes are approximately spherical synthetic lipid bilayer membranes with a typical diameter of 100 nm that enclose an internal aqueous phase. A previous study using liposomes suggested that key metabolites from the environment could permeate prebiotically plausible membranes in the absence of transport machinery such as transmembrane transporter proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. However, this foundational work did not contrast the permeability of core metabolites across archaeal and bacterial-type membranes, but rather used mixtures of simple prebiotically plausible lipids, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols and monoglycerides. An additional study has shown that, in the absence of counter-ions, liposomes made of diether lipids extracted from archaea (e.g. from <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>) display lower permeability to protons compared to liposomes made of lipids extracted from bacteria (e.g. from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. This feature was confirmed using independent approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]; the variation in proton permeability being likely due to the difference in the ether versus ester head-tail bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. This differential permeability constitutes an important trait for understanding the differences in energetic functions of the Archaea and Bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. It was also shown that bacterial and diether archaeal lipid membranes display similar permeabilities to glycerol, urea and ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, these permeability traits were measured at high extracellular metabolite concentration (i.e. 200 mM) using indirect spectroscopic techniques, which average over a large number of liposomes and associated impurities (e.g. multi-lamellar liposomes and lipid aggregates). As such there are a number of potential limitations of these results: i) they are based on ensemble measurements across variant lipid architectural forms, ii) they do not investigate permeability characteristics of cellular metabolites at biologically/ecologically realistic substrate concentrations, and iii) they investigate a limited number of metabolites. Collectively, this means that there is a limited understanding of the implications of membrane chemistry variation on metabolite permeability in biologically relevant contexts, particularly given recent evidence suggesting that living cells can obtain nutrients from the environment in a transporter protein-independent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Here we test the hypothesis that core archaeal and bacterial type lipid membranes have fundamentally different permeability traits directly implying that the ancient Archaea/Bacteria bifurcation would also encompass a distinct change in metabolite permeability. Such a difference would have profound effects for the evolution of membrane transporter repertoires, intracellular metabolic networks, and associated cellular ecologies. We present a new approach for the study of membrane permeability based on microfluidic manipulation of unilamellar vesicles composed of a single phospholipid bilayer of archaeal or bacterial membrane mimics. Our results show that the lipid divide demarcates a dichotomy in membrane permeability characteristics. In contrast to previous ideas, membranes composed of archaeal core phospholipids display elevated permeability to many compounds key for core metabolic functions. Using phylogenomic approaches, we also demonstrate that this functional difference correlates with variations in the evolution of the transporter protein encoding gene repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Microfluidic screening to explore membrane permeability characteristics</title><p id="P7">Here we report a system to enable the capture and individual placement of unilamellar vesicles obtained via electroformation of synthetic lipids (see Methods) in multiple parallel arrays of tens of vesicles using microfluidics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This approach enabled us to precisely control the chemostatic fluid environment of the vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The diameter of these vesicles is in the range of 5- to 15-μm. Although such diameter range is large for prokaryotic cell sizes, these dimensions were chosen to aid imaging and manipulation. In order to measure metabolite permeation into the unilamellar vesicles, we loaded the vesicles with a neutral pH buffer and carboxyfluorescein (CF), a fluorescent dye which allows direct assessment of molecular uptake by variations in fluorescent properties in response to changes in intra-vesicle metabolite concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In fact, the introduction of metabolites in the vesicle reduces the self-quenching properties of carboxyfluorescein, resulting in increased vesicle fluorescence. Therefore, a relative increase in intra-vesicle fluorescence indicates membrane permeability to the target metabolite when delivered via continuous flow through the microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and Methods). Individual metabolites were delivered into the extra-vesicle environment (also containing a neutral pH buffer), while imaging the changes in fluorescence levels of multiple individually trapped vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and Methods). By using this experimental approach, we conducted parallel controlled experiments exploring how cellular metabolites can cross membranes of different phospholipid chemical composition using changes in CF fluorescence as a reporter for membrane permeability to metabolites.</p><p id="P8">We first studied the permeability of single vesicles composed of synthetic lipids with isoprenoid chains containing methyl branches bonded to a glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P) backbone via ether bonds (archaeal-like membrane phospholipids – abbreviated here as ‘archaeal 4ME diether G1PC’) (lipid 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>) or synthetic lipids with fatty acids bonded to a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone via ester bonds (bacterial-like membrane phospholipids – ternary lipid mixture abbreviated here as ‘bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA’, lipid 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Tables S1</xref>) to eighteen small metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S2</xref>). Notably, synthetic G1P diether lipids with methyl branches are not commercially available, to our knowledge, and were therefore synthesised <italic>de novo</italic> for the purpose of this study (see Methods). We chose metabolites with different molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and number of rotatable bonds (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Our single-vesicle measurements revealed heterogeneity in the permeability of each synthetic lipid type to each metabolite, with some vesicles of each lipid type displaying a decrease in intracellular fluorescence during the delivery of each metabolite while other vesicles displayed an increase in intracellular fluorescence (temporal dependence of single-vesicle fluorescence for archaeal 4ME diether G1PC lipids and bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA lipids are reported with dashed magenta lines and dashed-dotted blue lines in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1</xref>). For example, the coefficient of variations in the permeability of archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles and of bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles to aspartic acid, glyceraldehyde and adenine, were 118% and 103%, 60% and 198%, 76% and 108% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1</xref>D, S1G and S1Q, respectively), in accordance with the proposition that lipid membranes are a system with heterogeneous functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Therefore, in order to compare the permeability of different synthetic lipid types to the same metabolite, we carried out Mann-Whitney two-tailed statistical comparisons between the distributions of intra-vesicle fluorescence after 3 minutes of delivery of each metabolite for each synthetic lipid type. Temporal dependence of fluorescence distribution means and standard deviations are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (magenta triangles and dashed lines for archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles, blue squares and dashed-dotted lines for bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles) together with single-vesicle fluorescence distributions and Mann-Whitney two-tailed statistical comparisons at t=3 (further details about Mann-Whitney two-tailed statistical comparisons are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We found that archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles were significantly more permeable to the amino acids glycine, alanine, leucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan and glutamine compared to bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1A-S1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consistent with the amino acid findings, archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles were also more permeable to the sugar’s glyceraldehyde, glycerol, deoxyribose, ribose and arabinose compared to bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1G-S1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), whereas we did not measure a significant difference in the permeability to dihydroxyacetone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1</xref>L, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, the difference in permeability was strongly distinct for three large sugar types, deoxyribose, ribose, and arabinose, the two former sugars including primary constituents of the hereditary materials DNA and RNA, respectively.</p><p id="P12">Finally, archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles were also more permeable to the amide urea, and the nucleobases cytosine, uracil, guanine and adenine compared to bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M-2Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1</xref>M-S1Q, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data suggest that important nitrogen sources and components of DNA and RNA can permeate archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles. The phosphonate 2-aminoethyl phosphonic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) showed no significant difference in permeability characteristics between the two types of vesicles. We also attempted to measure permeabilities to the nucleotide adenosine monophosphate, however, during pilot studies the vesicles burst during delivery of this chemical and so we did not test this substrate further.</p><p id="P13">Pooling together the data for the eighteen metabolites investigated, we did not find a significant correlation between permeability and lipid molecular weight or hydrophobicity (Pearson coefficient r = -0.22, 0.36, respectively, for archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles; r = 0.09, 0.24, respectively, for bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles; none significant at p = 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S2</xref>). These data suggest that the metabolic selectivity of these membrane mimics is complex and does not rely solely on basic molecular properties such as molecular weight or hydrophobicity. Taken together with previous findings demonstrating that solute hydrophobicity correlates poorly with permeability coefficients of eukaryotic fatty acid or phospholipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], our data corroborate the hypothesis that subtle variations in the metabolite atomic structure could contribute to differences in membrane permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. In fact, we found a significant correlation between permeability and rotatable bond number for archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles (Pearson coefficient r = -0.49, *) but not for bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles (r = -0.32, non-significant at p = 0.05).</p><p id="P14">The striking difference in CF fluorescence between archaeal 4ME diether G1PC and bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles was confirmed when we extended the duration of our permeability experiments from 3 to 6 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, the dimensions of each vesicle did not significantly change during metabolite delivery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S3</xref>), confirming that vesicle deformation did not occur in our experiments and did not play a role in the observed differences in permeability traits between archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles and bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles. Such differences were also not attributable to differential metabolite accumulation within the lipid bilayers, since: i) CF has very low affinity for the lipid hydrophobic chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], so interactions with substrates within the membrane are unlikely; ii) CF fluorescence intensity was uniform across whole vesicles for both lipid type and the full range of metabolites investigated, consistent with previous data obtained on fatty acid and phospholipid liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Our data do not allow us to infer a detailed kinetics of the permeation of each metabolite and could be complemented via pulse-chase experiments requiring faster fluidic exchanges. Therefore, we did not attempt to extract absolute kinetic parameters, such as the permeability coefficient, but centred this current work on directly comparing changes in CF fluorescence (as a proxy for permeability) between archaeal 4ME diether G1PC and bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles. However, we were able to observe differences in terms of both the uptake onset and slope for different metabolites. For example, glycine, ribose and uracil displayed a steep uptake during the first minute of their delivery to archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>, respectively), whereas the uptake of aspartic acid, glutamine and dihydroxyacetone started only after the first minute of their delivery to archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>). These data demonstrate that metabolites are not passing across vesicles via puncture holes generated during vesicle formation but by genuine diffusion through the lipid bilayers in a metabolite-specific manner.</p><p id="P15">As discussed in the introduction, natural archaeal membranes are formed from heterogenous mixtures of lipids some with tetraether bipolar lipids (e.g. caldarchaeol) which act to directly connect the membrane bilayers, a function that is likely to increase the stiffness of the membrane and reduce permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Such mixtures might have different properties than the homogenous membranes studied here. To explore this possibility, we attempted to use lipids extracted from <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>, predominantly containing diether lipids with head group derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], and lipids extracted from <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic>, predominantly containing tetraether lipids with head group derivatives of phosphatidylhexose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. However, we could not obtain mechanically stable vesicles via electroformation for either of these lipid mixtures. It is therefore important to mention that our experiments do not reveal the permeability traits of extant prokaryotic membrane mixtures but rather identify the contrasting permeability traits of the common and core building blocks of the archaeal and bacterial membranes.</p><p id="P16">Finally, we wanted to rule out that the relatively lower permeability of bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles could be due to interactions between different lipids within the ternary lipid mixture that we employed to mimic more closely bacterial membranes (lipid 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). To do so, we measured and contrasted permeability to urea, glycine, ribose, deoxyribose, glycerol and phosphonate in vesicles made of bacterial ternary-lipid mixtures (G3PE-PG-CA, lipid 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>) and vesicles made of single lipids (G3PE, lipid 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>) and found that these two different bacterial mimics displayed comparably low permeabilities to all the metabolites tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Which archaeal lipid characteristics determine permeability traits?</title><p id="P17">To uncover the chemical determinants of archaeal membrane permeability, we employed vesicles made of a range of lipids with a mixture of archaeal and bacterial lipid characteristics. We tested the impact of the lipid chain branching, length, tail-head bond (ester/ether) and the G1P vs G3P backbone on membrane permeability. We performed these experimental tests using urea, glycine, ribose, deoxyribose, glycerol and phosphonate towards which archaeal 4ME diether G1PC vesicles and bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles display different patterns of permeabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Firstly, we electroformed vesicles by using a lipid that carried a bacterial-like glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone but with archaeal like diether tail-head bond and isoprenoid chains containing methyl branches (4ME diether G3PC, lipid 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>, green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The permeabilities of these hybrid vesicles to the six metabolites investigated were not significantly different to the permeabilities of archaeal vesicles (4ME diether G1PC, lipid 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>, magenta upward triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) but were significantly higher than the permeabilities measured for the bacterial vesicles (diester G3PE-PG-CA, lipid 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>, blue squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance statistical comparisons are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These data suggested that the change from a G1P to a G3P backbone was not a key factor in determining membrane permeability.</p><p id="P19">Next, we tested a different hybrid lipid with the bacterial-like glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone but with archaeal-like diether tail-head bond and isoprenoid chains without methyl branches (Diether G3PC, lipid 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref> and black diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

This striking difference is possibly due to increased membrane fluidity in the presence of methyl branched lipid chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In the absence of methyl branching, these hybrid diether G3PC vesicles displayed permeabilities to urea, glycine, deoxyribose or ribose that were comparable to the permeabilities measured for bacterial diester G3PE-PG-CA vesicles (lipid 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref> and blue squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, respectively, none significantly different at p = 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Taken together these data demonstrate that increased membrane permeability can be achieved via the simultaneous use of an ether bond and methyl chain branching, both of which characterize the core lipids of archaea.</p><p id="P21">To follow on from this, we set out to determine whether permeability is affected by variations in the archaeal lipid head (lipid 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). However, despite attempting different electroformation protocols (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>) we could not produce vesicles using this lipid, possibly because this lipid forms non-lamellar structures of either a cubic or hexagonal fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. We note, however, that previous studies suggest that lipid headgroup composition has only limited impact on the permeation of small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P22">Next, we investigated how permeability varies in phospholipids according to chain length. Synthetic G1P lipids with methyl branches are not commercially available, so we focused on the study of G3P lipids without methyl branches and with variant chain lengths (lipids 4, 8, 9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). These experiments provide no evidence for a significant correlation between lipid chain length (C=12, C=16 and C=18, i.e. lipids 8, 4 and 9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>) and permeability to any of the metabolites investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S5</xref>, Pearson correlation coefficient r=-0.58, 0.95, 0.52, -0.10, -0.69 and 0.30 for urea, glycine, glycerol, phosphonate, deoxyribose and ribose, respectively), corroborating previous findings on eukaryotic membrane mimics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Significant differences in permeability to water and weak acids were previously observed only for large variations in chain length; an increase from 14 to 26 in the length of acyl chains of eukaryotic lipids led to a five-fold decrease in permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Accordingly, our data show that a short chain length slightly favoured permeability to urea and deoxyribose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S5E</xref>, respectively). In contrast, a long chain length slightly favoured permeability to glycine and ribose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S5F</xref>, respectively), but overall, these effects were masked by vesicle-to-vesicle variation in permeability to these metabolites. Furthermore, we attempted to produce vesicles using lipids of other chain lengths (C=6 and C=14, i.e. lipids 10 and 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). However, these vesicles appeared to be mechanically unstable, possibly because their transition temperature is close to the temperature at which we carried out our membrane permeability assays. We note, these comparisons did not include variations in the number of methyl branches per chain so our experiments do not rule out the possibility that differences in the number of methyl branches may alter permeability characteristics.</p><p id="P23">Our next experiments demonstrated that decreasing bonding saturation (i.e. single bonds that were more likely present in prebiotic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] versus double bonds) along hybrid G3P diether phospholipids of fixed chain length (C=18, lipid 12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>) significantly decreased permeability to the small amide, urea, and, to a lesser extent, to the small amino acid, glycine, compared to bonding unsaturation (i.e. double bonds, lipid 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S6B</xref>, *** and *, respectively).

Given the variance of these lipid forms across Archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] and the observation that such variants are the minority constituents in some archaeal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], we suggest they are of lesser importance for understanding the evolution of core/ancestral permeability functions in ancestral cell forms carrying archaeal lipids. However, we do acknowledge that introduction of these lipid variations is likely to alter permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] and is an important factor for determining the ecology of extant Archaea. The experimental platform presented is readily adaptable to investigate the effect of further chemistry variations, however, these synthetic lipids are not currently commercially available. Future work should explore the effect of lipid mixtures on permeability traits. Furthermore, we did not investigate the effect on permeability of membrane variants embedding an S-layer, a peptidoglycan layer, or an outer membrane such as those seen in diderm bacteria, because all these features are predicted to follow the archaeal/bacterial bifurcation and so represent secondary elaborations relative to the lipid divide. We also acknowledge that permeability traits can vary with changes in environmental conditions such as pH (which we kept constant at 7.4), temperature (which we kept constant at 22 °C) or salinity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] and the differences we have observed are likely subject to variation in different environmental conditions. Although our experimental platform could be adapted to investigate permeability traits under variant environmental conditions, there are constraints as vesicles suffer damage in the presence of low or high pH and/or salinity. Moreover, lipids change state above or below the transition temperature. Therefore, the experimental platform would need further development to physically stabilise vesicles, by using, for example, higher density media or by forming vesicles on physical support structures. However, such experiments would tell us much about the conditions in which cellular chasses evolved.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Membrane permeability negatively correlates with transporter gene repertoires</title><p id="P25">The observed differences in membrane permeability imply that any transition between archaeal and bacterial-type membrane chemistries would require extensive recalibration of numerous cellular systems in response to changes in permeability, osmotic stress, and metabolite homeostasis. Such a transition could be facilitated by a mixed archaeal-bacterial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], but the ultimate change would require adaptation to these altered cellular properties. The evolution of membrane transporters could permit a reduction in lipid membrane permeability, for example, if a cell was to transition from an archaeal-like membrane to a bacterial-like membrane, as predicted under some hypotheses for the origins of the eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Accordingly, given the increased permeability of the core archaeal lipid membranes shown here, we hypothesized that archaeal genomes would encode a significantly reduced complement of transporter gene families relative to Bacteria, particularly for those protein families known to transport metabolites capable of permeating archaeal lipid membranes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). A limited transporter repertoire could reflect a reduced dependency on protein-based translocation systems as metabolite requirements could be satisfied by a combination of core metabolic function and lipid membrane permeability. Likewise, increased membrane permeability may limit the utility of membrane transporters by decreasing transport efficiency or impairing the formation of concentration gradients.</p><p id="P26">To test this hypothesis, we iteratively searched diverse bacterial (n = 3,044) and archaeal (n = 243) genome-derived predicted proteomes using profile hidden Markov models (HMM, n = 277) derived from TCDB (Transporter Classification Database) protein families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], to identify previously classified transporter homologs across prokaryotes. Despite the sensitivity of our search, the Archaea had fewer transporters relative to the Bacteria, irrespective of bacterial membrane system (e.g., monoderms or diderms) and regardless of whether transporter numbers were normalised to the total number of proteins per genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S7A</xref>). Certain transporter families were consistently encoded across prokaryotes, including many ion transporters (see cluster 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, largely composed of ion transporters), which are required due to the impermeability of both membrane types to ions, with the exception of protons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In contrast, other families showed significantly reduced representation in Archaea (see clusters 1, 3, and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> which were functionally heterogeneous, whereas cluster 4 comprised outer membrane transporters associated with diderms). In particular, transporter families known to translocate metabolites similar to those that permeate archaeal membrane mimics (e.g., amino acids, sugars and nucleobases shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) were significantly depleted even when accounting for differential taxon sampling bias using bootstrap resampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">It has previously been argued that protein-membrane interactions, attuned to the specific lipid characteristics of either bacterial or archaeal membranes, may have acted to enforce the lipid divide as the Bacteria and Archaea diversified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Therefore, to account for the possibility that archaeal transporters were not accurately recovered in our searches due to divergent biochemical characteristics or a lack of archaeal transporter family representation in TCDB, we first examined the possibility that archaeal membrane transporters have transmembrane (TM) domains with different lengths or alternative amino acid compositions, a factor that may have obscured previous HMM based annotations of transporter gene families. Comparisons between over 10.8 million bacterial and 528,000 archaeal TM domains (identified from over 2.2 million bacterial and 116,000 archaeal transporter proteins) revealed no significant differences in TM domain characteristics between Archaea and Bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S7C</xref>), suggesting that these biochemical properties would neither impair bioinformatic detection nor would limit horizontal gene transfer of transporter proteins from Bacteria to Archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, we note that differences may be obscured because of lower archaeal sampling and absence of systematic functional studies of archaeal transporters not identified by cross referencing bacterial transporter families.</p><p id="P28">Secondly, to identify putative archaeal transporters that may have been absent from the TCDB database, we clustered archaeal proteins into protein families and identified those with characteristics indicative of transporter proteins (a median of at least four TM domains and annotation with transporter-associated PFAM domain). This search revealed only thirteen previously unsampled putative transporter families (mostly branched-chain amino acid permeases, ABC- and EamA-transporters) that were predicted to function in metabolite uptake and were present in at least a quarter of archaeal species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, only a single undetected putative ABC-transporter family was identified in over 50% of archaeal species (70.8%). These results strongly indicate that unidentified transporters do not account for the reduced transporter repertoire observed in Archaea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Together, these results are consistent with a reduced dependency on metabolite transporter proteins in Archaea, an evolutionary outcome which could reflect a reduced transporter repertoire in the last archaeal common ancestor or frequent transporter losses in individual archaeal lineages. Regardless, transporter reduction may have been facilitated, in part, by the increased metabolite permeability of archaeal lipid membranes which, in turn, reduces the requirement for, or utility of, transporter proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P29">The deepest branch in the tree of life separates the Archaea and the Bacteria. This ancient node demarks two different core membrane chemistries known as the lipid divide. There is considerable variation in membrane composition on both sides of the lipid divide, but fundamentally these membranes are built of two different phospholipid chemistries. Here we demonstrate that homogenous versions of the archaeal and bacterial core lipid membranes show distinct differences in permeability characteristics when generated using electroformation. Archaeal-type lipid membranes show permeability to a range of compounds that would theoretically be useful to known cellular metabolic networks. Our data demonstrate that archaeal membrane permeability is dependent on the simultaneous presence of methyl chain branching and ether bond properties, two hallmarks of archaeal lipids. This selective permeability could have provided early cellular forms with access to specific metabolic resources, from which a metabolic network could arise and diversify. Taken together with previous findings demonstrating that archaeal lipid membranes display low permeability to ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], these data support the suggestion that early cellular forms without a dedicated protein based transmembrane transportation system would be more likely to acquire stable and diversified metabolic functions using an archaeal lipid membrane than a bacterial lipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Preparation of materials</title><p id="P30">All chemicals were purchased from Merck.

Once a cove had been occupied by a vesicle, the amount of fluid entering the cove was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] but still allowed molecular diffusion in the cove, which was crucial for the permeability assay. Using the tape prevented the fluorescent vesicle suspension from entering into the metabolite inlet. The chip was then transferred under the microscope. A 1 mL plastic syringe (Becton Dickinson) was filled with the washing buffer and a second 1 mL syringe was filled with a 1 mM solution of the metabolite under investigation. Both syringes were connected to 23-gauge needles (Becton Dickinson) and Masterflex Transfer Tygon tubing with 0.5 mm inner and 1.5 mm outer diameter (Cole-Parmer Instrument). Next, the syringes were connected to a Nemesys pump controlled via the QmixElements software (Centoni). The tape was then removed from the metabolite inlet and the tubing containing the metabolite solution under investigation was inserted into the metabolite inlet while the metabolite solution was flowing at a rate of 0.5 μL/h. Next, the tubing containing the washing buffer was inserted into the washing buffer inlet while the buffer solution was flowing at a rate of 5 μL/h. These flow rates were then simultaneously increased at steps of 0.5 μL/h every 10 s up to 2 μL/h for the metabolite solution and at steps of 5 μL/h every 10 s up to 25 μL/h for the buffer solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These maximal flow rates were kept constant for 20 min to remove any free CF molecules from the microfluidic environment while the fluorescent vesicles remained confined in the coves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Flowing the metabolite solution at a low rate (i.e. 2 μL/h) prevented the accumulation of free CF molecules in the metabolite inlet but did not affect the permeability assay since we obtained similar permeability traits in the absence or presence of this low flow rate. Next, the metabolite solution under investigation was delivered to the fluorescent vesicles in the coves by reducing the flow rate of the washing buffer from 25 μL/h to 1 μL/h and by increasing the flow rate of the metabolite solution from 2 μL/h to 25 μL/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, the chip was visually inspected by using a 20× 0.85 N.A. oil-immersion objective mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX73) equipped with a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor, used at an exposure time of 0.1s), a blue LED (CoolLED pE300white, used at 30% of its intensity) and a FITC filter. This setup allowed us to simultaneously image 12 coves, therefore the area of the chip that contained the higher number of vesicles trapped in the coves was chosen. An image of such an area was acquired immediately after increasing the metabolite solution flow rate and then at intervals of 30 s for 3 min. All experiments were performed at an intra- and extra-vesicle pH of 7.4, since pH changes are known to affect CF fluorescence intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. For each membrane mimic in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>, in order to account for the impact of both the delivery of the washing buffer solution and photobleaching on the intra-vesicle CF fluorescence signal, we performed separate control assays by connecting the metabolite inlet to a syringe containing the washing buffer solution instead of the metabolite solution. Apart from this modification, these control assays were carriedout following the protocol described above for the microfluidic permeability assays. The intra-vesicle CF fluorescence consistently linearly decreased during the delivery of the washing buffer for all membrane mimics investigated and this information was used to provide a background signal for the corresponding microfluidic permeability assays (see Image and data analysis section below).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Image and data analysis</title><p id="P37">Images of the fluorescent vesicles for each membrane mimic trapped in the microfluidic coves during the 3 min delivery of each metabolite were imported in ImageJ to produce a temporal image stack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>] and analysed as follows to extract quantitative comparative information about the permeability traits of each membrane mimic to each metabolite. Only images of unilamellar vesicles were retained for analysis, whereas images of multilamellar vesicles were not taken forward. To obtain the single-vesicle temporal dependence of intravesicle fluorescence, for each image and each time point, a circle was drawn around each vesicle. A second circle of identical dimensions was drawn in an area 10 μm to the left of the vesicle. This allowed us to extract the mean CF fluorescence of each vesicle and the background around it at each time point, respectively. The background fluorescence was subtracted from the corresponding intra-vesicle fluorescence for each vesicle and each time point. Next, for each vesicle from all the background subtracted values, the initial intra-vesicle fluorescence value (at t=0) was subtracted. Next, these values were corrected to account for the impact of both the delivery of the washing buffer solution and photobleaching on the intra-vesicle CF fluorescence signal. To do so a correction factor was calculated from the microfluidic control assay data sets (see below), multiplied by each time value and added to the corresponding intra-vesicle fluorescence value (after the background and initial fluorescence value subtractions above). To obtain a correction factor for each membrane mimic, first we applied the image analysis protocol above to obtain the single-vesicle temporal dependence of intra-vesicle fluorescence values during the delivery of the washing buffer and subtract from these values the corresponding background and initial intra-vesicle fluorescence value. Second, we averaged these temporal dependences of corrected single-vesicle fluorescence values to obtain a mean temporal dependence for each membrane mimic during the delivery of the washing buffer. Finally, we fitted this mean temporal dependence to a linear regression with the intercept forced to zero and obtained the slope of the linear fluorescence decrease for each membrane mimic. These slope values were used as correction factors to calculate the permeability of each membrane mimic to each metabolite as described above. For some of the membrane mimic and metabolite pairs we noticed a minority of outliers (i.e. vesicles that became either much brighter or dimmer with respect to the majority of vesicles investigated during metabolite delivery, see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This heterogeneity is common when investigating membrane permeability both <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P38">The permeability of each membrane mimic to each metabolite was measured in three independent experiments from three independent vesicle electroformations. Throughout the manuscript N indicates the number of single vesicles investigated for each membrane mimic and metabolite pair. N varies across different metabolite-experiments investigated since the number of vesicles trapped within the microfluidic coves of the chosen chip area varied. However, care was taken to obtain the same N for each metabolite-experiment across the different membrane mimics comparisons to ensure reliable statistical comparisons. In order to do so, when a statistical comparison was to be made between data sets of different N, corrected intra-vesicle fluorescence values were randomly selected from the data set that contained the higher N. Such statistical comparisons were carried out via two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests when comparing distributions of corrected intra-vesicle fluorescence values at t=3 min for two different lipid types (reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance when comparing distributions of corrected intra-vesicle fluorescence values at t=3 min for more than two different lipid types (reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). **** indicates a p-value &lt; 0.0001, *** indicates a p-value &lt; 0.001, ** indicates a p-value &lt; 0.01, * indicates a p-value &lt; 0.05, n.s. indicates a p-value &gt; 0.05. All data analysis and statistical comparisons were carried out and plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>In silico identification of prokaryotic transporter proteins</title><p id="P39">To characterize the transporter repertoires of bacterial and archaeal species in silico, we first assembled a collection of prokaryotic reference proteomes from UniProt (release 2021_03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]). To minimize taxonomic redundancy, a single proteome was selected per genus based on BUSCO completeness scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], resulting in 3,044 bacterial and 244 archaeal proteomes. Metagenomes from the bacterial candidate phyla radiation (CPR) were excluded due to their prevalence and lack of morphological information. To comprehensively identify transporter homologs, profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) derived from TCDB (Transporter Classification Database) protein families (termed tcDoms, downloaded 2 June 2021) were used to search each proteome using HMMER v3.1b2 (E &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, incE &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, domE &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. If multiple HMMs identified the same predicted protein, the protein was assigned to the family with the lower E-value. To improve the sensitivity of the HMMs, the hits from the initial HMM search were aligned using MAFFT v7.471 (-auto), trimmed with a gap-threshold of 10% using trimAl v1.4, and the resulting alignments were used to generate new HMMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. Using the second iteration HMMs, another search was conducted as above, producing the final set of identified proteins. To reduce the potential effects of taxon sampling and dataset bias, prokaryotic taxa were grouped into their respective orders based on NCBI Taxonomy classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>]. Transporter abundance was then interpreted as the median number of transporters assigned to a given TCDB family, normalized by the total number of proteins encoded by each taxa, across each order. The resulting distribution was visualized in R v4.0.2 and hierarchical clustering was done using euclidean distances and the Ward.D2 clustering method implemented by pheatmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-08-31/web/packages/pheatmap/pheatmap.pdf">https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-08-31/web/packages/pheatmap/pheatmap.pdf</ext-link>).
