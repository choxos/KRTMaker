Included is the activation of the host p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a major role in inflammation and is a central driver of COVID-19 clinical presentations. Inhibition of p38/MAPK activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells reduces both cytokine production and viral replication. Here, we combined genetic screening with quantitative phosphoproteomics to better understand interactions between the p38/MAPK pathway and SARS-CoV-2. We found that several components of the p38/MAPK pathway impacted SARS-CoV-2 replication and that p38β is a critical host factor for virus replication, and it prevents activation of the type-I interferon pathway. Quantitative phosphoproteomics uncovered several SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphorylation sites near the N-terminus that were sensitive to p38 inhibition. Similar to p38β depletion, mutation of these nucleocapsid residues was associated with reduced virus replication and increased activation of type-I interferon signaling. Taken together, this study reveals a unique proviral function for p38β that is not shared with p38α and supports exploring p38β inhibitor development as a strategy towards developing a new class of COVID-19 therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has killed millions since it emerged in 2019. Severe COVID-19 cases are associated with excessive lung inflammation that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). This excessive inflammation is in part driven by an imbalanced immune response; compared to other respiratory virus infections, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a delay in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). While vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness and death, novel SARS-CoV-2 variants are continuously emerging with the ability to partially escape prior immunity. Currently, three COVID-19 therapies are available: remdesivir, molnupiravir, and PAXLOVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). While effective, these therapies need to be administered early in infection, and as they all target single viral proteins, they are susceptible escape mutants. Host-directed therapies are attractive alternatives to antivirals as they are more likely to have broad antiviral activity and are less susceptible to resistance. One such therapy is dexamethasone, an immunomodulatory drug that combats inflammation and reduces COVID-19 mortality, bolstering the concept that targeting host pathways is a viable treatment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We previously reported that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) pathway becomes activated during infection, and that inhibition of p38 reduces both inflammatory cytokine expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication, suggesting that p38 inhibition may target multiple mechanisms related to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). While the mechanisms by which the p38/MAPK pathway regulates inflammation are well described, the mechanism(s) by which it promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication is unknown. Furthermore, the p38/MAPK pathway is comprised of four p38 kinase isoforms and many downstream kinases, but it is not known which kinases at which levels of the p38/MAPK cascade impact SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here we combined genetic and chemical perturbations, and quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics to better understand interactions between the p38/MAPK pathway and SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells. We identified p38β as an essential host factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and found that while p38β inhibition did not impact viral mRNA abundance, it reduced the abundance of viral protein. Additionally, depletion of p38β specifically resulted in a significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN-I. We applied an unbiased approach to identify novel, putative p38β substrates in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified which substrates affect virus replication through siRNA screening. Lastly, we discovered four phosphosites on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) that were sensitive to the SB203580 p38 kinase inhibitor and found that phosphoablative mutation of these residues attenuated SARS-CoV-2 growth.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparisons across SARS-CoV-2 proteomics studies reveal pathways consistently regulated across species and cell types</title><p id="P6">To better understand the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we quantified changes in protein and phosphosite abundance in A549 human lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 (A549-ACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In total, this analysis comprised 6,089 unique protein groups and 16,032 unique phosphosite groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). “Phosphosite group” refers to modified residues identified on peptides with sequences that are unique for a single protein or shared across a group of homologous proteins. Phosphosite groups also separate phosphosites identified on singly, doubly, or triply phosphorylated peptides. Throughout this study, we considered protein/phosphosite groups with |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.05 to be differentially abundant. At the protein level, SARS-CoV-2 proteins (N, ORF1AB/NSP1, ORF1AB/NSP3, ORF9B, and S) were increased by these criteria, with limited changes in host protein groups, consistent with SARS-CoV-2-mediated suppression of host protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We observed more changes in the phosphoproteome, with 98 and 33 phosphosite groups increased and decreased, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We next compared our A549 data (“higgins”) with four published proteomics studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the following cell types: Caco-2 human lung epithelial cells (“bojkova”), Vero E6 African Green Monkey kidney cells (“bouhaddou”), human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAT2, “hekman”), and A549 cells (“stukalov”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Pairwise Pearson correlation analysis of log<sub>2</sub>fold-change profiles for both protein abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S1A</xref>) and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) data clustered primarily according to the animal species. Comparing data collected 24-hours post-infection in each study, four phosphosites were upregulated by at least 2-fold in four of the studies: HSPB1/HSP27 S15, MATR3 S188, TRIM28/TIF1B/KAP1 S473, and SZRD1 S107 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). None of these sites were detected in iAT2 cells. HSPB1 S15 and TRIM28 S473 are canonical p38/MAPK pathway substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next performed kinase activity analysis based on log<sub>2</sub>fold-change profiles using a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach with kinase-substrate annotations from PhosphoSite Plus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Human cell line kinase activity profiles were strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The ten most regulated kinases across all datasets examined were AURKB, mTOR, CHK1, PLK1, GSK3β, p38α, AMPKA1, ATM, ATR, and Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Kinases involved in cell cycle arrest, ATM, ATR, PLK1, and AURKB, were regulated in all datasets, consistent with evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Of particular interest to this study, the p38α MAPK was significantly regulated in all studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Multiple p38/MAPK pathway components impact SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells</title><p id="P9">A gap remains in understanding which components of the p38/MAPK pathway impact SARS-CoV-2 replication. To address this, we employed siRNA screening methodology to assess how depletion of individual p38/MAPK pathway kinases affects SARS-CoV-2 replication. A549-ACE2 cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting kinase genes, non-targeting control (NTC), or SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), and infected with 0.1 MOI of SARS-CoV-2 for 36 hours. The cells were then fixed and stained for SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the percentage of N-positive cells was determined by immunofluorescence image cytometry, and then normalized to the control infected condition (siNTC-transfected and SARS-CoV-2 infected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first screened the four p38 isoforms (p38α/MAPK14, p38β/MAPK11, p38γ/MAPK12, and p38δ/MAPK13) as functional differences between the isoforms in the context of virus infection are particularly understudied. We identified p38β as an essential host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an approximate 90% reduction in infection and 1000-fold reduction in virus titer when p38β was depleted compared to the infected control condition. Surprisingly, knockdown of p38α did not affect infection even though p38α and p38β are often presumed to be functionally redundant and p38α is thought to be the major isoform regulating immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We also found that p38δ depletion reduced infection by approximately 40% and that p38γ knockdown increased it by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on mRNA-sequencing analysis of A549-ACE2 cells, p38α is the most abundant isoform transcript, followed by p38γ, p38β, and lastly, p38δ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2A</xref>). We then screened the kinases canonically downstream, MAPKAPK2/MK2, MAPKAPK3/MK3, MAPKAPK5/MK5, MSK1, MSK2, and MKNK1, to test the hypothesis that downstream kinase(s) mediate the proviral activity of p38β. MSK2 knockdown reduced infection by approximately 65% and virus titer by 50-fold, while depletion of the other downstream kinases had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). We confirmed efficient siRNA knockdown of p38α, p38β, p38γ, and MSK2 protein expression by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), but were unable to verify knockdown of p38δ with commercial antibodies, likely because its basal expression is low in A549 cells. Cell viability after siRNA transfection was decreased after p38β, p38δ, and MSK2 knockdown by 10-20%, but it is unlikely that infection phenotypes observed are solely due to the decrease in cell viability because other targets like MAPKAP3 also decreased cell viability but did not affect infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2B</xref>). To validate that the proviral p38β phenotype was not an off-target effect of the siRNAs, we replicated our findings with an independent set of controls and p38β gene-targeting pooled siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Focusing next on upstream portions of the p38/MAPK pathway, we tested individual MAPKKK or MAPKK knockdown on virus replication. Among the MAPKKKs screened, we found that MAP3K6/ASK2, MAP3K8/TPL2/COT, MAP3K9/MLK1, MAP3K11/MLK3, and TAOK1/MAP3K16 depletion reduced the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by 30-95%, while MAP3K7/TAK1 and TAOK2/MAP3K17/PSK knockdown increased it by nearly 30% and 100%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). As for the MAPKKs, the canonical p38-regulating MAP2K3/MEK3 and MAP2K6/MEK6, had no phenotype, likely because they are functionally redundant and may not exhibit a phenotype when knocked down individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Interestingly, we found that depletion of MAP2K4/MEK4, widely considered a major regulator of JNK/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), decreased infection. This finding could suggest that MAP2K4 can regulate the p38s, or alternatively, that JNK-mediated signaling is involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Of the upstream hits, cell viability was affected only by MAP3K8 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2B</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that virus titers were significantly reduced upon MAP3K8, MAP3K9, and MAP3K11 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). In summary, we found that SARS-CoV-2 replication is promoted by the p38/MAPK signaling cascade specifically involving, when tested individually, the MAPKKKs: MAP3K6, MAP3K8, MAP3K9, MAP3K11, and TAOK1; the MAPKK: MAP2K4; the p38s: p38β and p38δ; and the mediator kinase, MSK2.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>p38β knockdown reduces viral protein, not viral mRNA, in human lung epithelial cells, and promotes type 1 interferon activity</title><p id="P11">To begin characterizing p38β activity during infection, viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), genomic RNA (gRNA), and protein abundance were measured after a high MOI, single-cycle SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549-ACE2 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting controls or p38β. A single cycle infection allowed us to observe the behavior of the virus during one life cycle without multiple iterations of infections confounding observations. First, as a control, knockdown of SARS-CoV-2 N compared to NTC resulted in significant decreases in both viral protein and transcript abundance. p38β depletion resulted in no change in genomic RNA (i.e. <italic>NSP14</italic>) or subgenomic mRNA (i.e. <italic>TRS-N</italic>) abundance, however, knockdown of p38β resulted in a significant decrease in viral protein, but no change in viral transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These findings suggest the mechanism in which p38β promotes virus replication is acting after viral RNA synthesis.</p><p id="P12">We next used mRNA sequencing to analyze transcriptome changes in p38β-depleted or control A549-ACE2 cells infected for a single replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Samples clustered by condition as measured by principal component analysis (S3A-B). Control infected cells fold over mock-infected cells resulted in 197 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 1.5 and adj. p-value &lt; 0.05) and p38β-depleted, infected cells fold over mock resulted in 1,303 DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). Consistent with the RT-qPCR results, the percentage of viral reads did not change between control infected cells and p38β-depleted cells, even though p38β protein expression was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">937 genes were differentially expressed between the infected, p38β-depleted cells, and the control infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). These genes, shown as a heatmap of log<sub>2</sub>fold-changes for each condition fold over mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), frequently trended in the same direction, but to a larger degree with p38β knockdown. Additionally, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization- and IFN-I-related GO terms were significantly enriched by the upregulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data suggest that p38β negatively regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN-I, which was not expected as p38 kinases are generally thought to positively regulate cytokine expression. The same analysis on the downregulated DEGs enriched for GO terms related to second messenger-mediated signaling, metal ion homeostasis, and cell secretions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S6</xref>). Focusing on the genes that contributed to the significance of “Type 1 interferon signaling pathway”, some genes were impacted more than others by p38β depletion compared to infected control and mock-infected conditions. For example, the transcripts per million reads (TPM) counts for genes such as <italic>RSAD2</italic>, <italic>IFNA1, IFI27</italic>, and <italic>OASL</italic> were similar for mock-infected and infected control, but much higher in the p38-depleted condition, whereas for most other genes, both infected conditions had more counts than the mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data suggest p38β may differentially regulate the expression of IFN-related genes. Genes that contributed to the most significantly enriched annotations, extracellular matrix organization and calcium-mediated signaling, exhibited similar abundance changes (S3E-F).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>p38β proviral mechanism is primarily STAT1-independent but leads to ISG expression as a byproduct</title><p id="P14">To assess if transcriptome changes were also reflected at the proteome level, we assessed how siRNA knockdown of p38β or MSK2 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the host proteome using quantitative proteomics. In biological quadruplicate, A549-ACE2 cells were transfected with pooled siRNAs targeting NTC, p38β, or MSK2. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 36-hours post-infection, cells were lysed and subjected to quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). A total of 4,900 unique protein groups and 14,414 unique phosphosite groups were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). These data clustered by their respective siRNA targets in Pearson correlation analysis and each sample had similar normalized log<sub>2</sub>intensity distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S4A-D</xref>). In comparison to siNTC-transfected/mock-infected cells, siNTC-transfected/SARS-CoV-2-infected (control infected) cells yielded few changes to the proteome and large changes to the phosphoproteome with approximately 1,000 phosphosite groups significantly changing. More changes were observed here than in our preliminary A549-ACE2 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>); the siRNA analysis included a greater number of biological replicates (4 vs. 3) and reduced technical variability that yielded a greater number of features with lower p-values. Furthermore, siRNA transfection may have impacted the number of significant changes.</p><p id="P15">Knockdown of each kinase in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells led to substantial changes to the proteome. Compared to control infected cells, knockdown of p38β or MSK2, led to 287 and 355 unique protein groups significantly increasing, respectively, and 274 and 122 protein groups significantly decreasing, respectively. There were also significant changes to the phosphoproteome; in comparison to control infected cells, knockdown of p38β or MSK2 led to 75 and 474 unique phosphosite groups significantly increasing, respectively, and 339 and 624 phosphosite groups significantly decreasing, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Consistent with our observations made at the transcriptome level, GO enrichment analysis of protein abundance log<sub>2</sub>fold-change profiles revealed that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells depleted of p38β exhibited a strong IFN-I signature compared to control infected cells. MSK2 knockdown in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells did not lead to a comparable phenotype, suggesting MSK2 does not mediate p38β-related interferon regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S7</xref>). Focusing on well-characterized ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), most were enhanced in response to p38β depletion cells compared to control infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that p38β knockdown led to an increase in MX1, a prototypical ISG, and specifically in the context of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S4E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These findings led us to question whether perturbation of p38β prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication by inducing ISG expression, which in turn suppresses viral replication, or if perturbation of p38β prevents replication in an independent manner that incidentally leads to the expression of ISGs, for example, by exposing a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is detected by the innate immune sensors. To address this, we performed SARS-CoV-2 infections and siRNA knockdowns of controls or p38β in A549-ACE2 cells or STAT1-knockout A549-ACE2 cells, which are insensitive to IFN-I or IFN-III signaling. If STAT1-dependent expression of ISGs is required to restrict infection in cells with reduced p38β expression, deletion of STAT1 would restore SARS-CoV-2 replication to wild-type levels. We found that while the reduction in infection when p38β is depleted is significant, it is not appreciably rescued by STAT1-knockout, indicating that the mechanism of action of p38β is primarily STAT1-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The profiles were then hierarchically clustered based on their Euclidean distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), generating a dendrogram tree that was then cut iteratively 99 times in order of decreasing height to generate between 2 and 100 clusters. For each iteration, the significance of enrichment of p38α/β substrates in each cluster was calculated with a hypergeometric test. The cluster most significantly enriched for known p38α/β substrates occurred in iterations 3-12, with a hypergeometric p-value of 0.005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). The phosphosite profiles within this cluster are very similar, with the representative profile behaving as expected: during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the log<sub>2</sub>fold-change is high because the p38 pathway is active, and when p38β is genetically or chemically inhibited, it decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). The cluster contains 35 phosphosites in total including three annotated p38α/β substrate sites (HSPB1 S15, RBM7 S137, and TRIM28 S473), several p38α/β substrates at phosphosites not previously annotated as p38α/β-dependent (TRIM28 S471, HSPB1 S78, HSPB1 S82, NELFE S51), as well as proteins physically associated with annotated p38α/β substrates (LARP7 and TRIM24, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S8</xref>).

In support of our KiPPC analysis results, we used the Kinase Library to analyze our cluster’s phosphosite motifs and found that the kinases most likely to phosphorylate these substrates are p38/MAPK pathway members, MAPKAP2, MAPKAP3, and MAPKAP5, and related CAMK-type kinases, CAMK2-A, -B, -D, and -G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We next aimed to determine if any of the novel, putative substrates impact SARS-CoV-2 replication by employing the same siRNA screening methodology described above. We found that depletion of a vast majority of putative p38α/β substrates tested (22 of 29) resulted in a significant increase in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also assessed cell viability in response to each siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5N</xref>).

In order to focus on viral phosphosites, we specifically looked at the short, terminal drug treatment dataset because this experimental framework does not affect total viral protein abundance, allowing us to directly and accurately quantify changes to viral phosphosites in response to p38 inhibition. In our analyses, SARS-CoV-2 N was the only viral protein identified that harbored SB203580-sensitive phosphosites based on p-values, although the fold-changes were less than the 2-fold threshold we implemented throughout this study. We identified four N phosphosites (S21, S23, T24, and S26) that decreased during infection in response to SB203580 compared to DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> and S6A). These sites are located in an intrinsically disordered region close to the N-terminus of N. Additionally, these amino acid residues have no or relatively low entropy (i.e. variation) amongst SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Nextstrain resource (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We confirmed no significant difference in total N protein abundance between DMSO-treated, infected cells and SB203580-treated, infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These sites, phosphorylated either directly or indirectly by p38α and/or p38β, could confer changes in N activity that affect virus replication. To test this hypothesis, we generated a recombinant, phosphoablative mutant of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 (rSARS-CoV-2<sup>N4A</sup>) containing alanine substitutions at the four SB203580-sensitive phosphoresidues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In a longitudinal experiment comparing virus titer of recombinant wild-type SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 (rSARS-CoV-2<sup>WT</sup>) to rSARS-CoV-2<sup>N4A</sup>, the mutant virus was significantly attenuated in titer at several timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed that rSARS-CoV-2<sup>N4A</sup> infection of Vero E6 produced morphologically different plaques, larger with less defined edges, than rSARS-CoV-2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Lastly, rSARS-CoV-2<sup>N4A</sup> infection of A549-ACE2 cells led to a higher induction of a canonical ISG, MX1, than infection with rSARS-CoV-2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). While future work is required to assess the underlying biochemistry responsible for the N4A phenotype, these data clearly demonstrate a need for p38β in SARS-CoV-2 biology. In summary, we found the N-terminal phosphorylation of N promoted viral production, albeit less significantly than p38β knockdown, suggesting that p38 impacts viral replication by modulating both viral and host substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we systematically characterized the p38/MAPK pathway in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection using a combination of genetics, genomics, and proteomics. We identified the specific members of the p38/MAPK pathway that impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, both negatively and positively, and discovered novel pathway kinase substrates in an unbiased manner. We found that p38β is the major component of the p38/MAPK pathway contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection and that it does so at a stage of virus replication after viral mRNA synthesis. Additionally, we showed that depletion of p38β leads to a significant induction of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also identified several phosphosites on the N-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 N that are sensitive to the p38α/β inhibitor, SB203580, and showed that the inhibition of phosphorylation of these residues results in attenuated virus growth and increased IFN-I activity. These findings reveal a novel dynamic between SARS-CoV-2 and p38/MAPK biology, and provide host targets of the p38 pathway that may be leveraged for drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.</p><sec id="S10"><title>The p38/MAPK pathway activity is significantly increased during SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse cell types</title><p id="P22">There are many documented mechanisms by which the p38/MAPK pathway may become activated in the context of viral infection.

We only analyzed single knockdowns, but it is possible that there are additional components of the p38/MAPK pathway regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection that were masked by functional redundancy in our screen. p38α is presumed to be the major isoform involved in inducing immune responses, as p38β knockout in mice contributes to neither p38-dependent immediate-early gene transcription nor LPS-induced inflammation. However, while immune responses in p38β<sup>-/-</sup> mice have been assessed in the contexts of LPS stimulation and TNF overexpression, they have not been assessed in the context of viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Our findings emphasize the need for further research and reagents to help better characterize p38β. p38β does not appear to be essential as p38β knockout mice are viable and fertile whereas p38α knockout mice are embryonically lethal, and p38β has a distinctly smaller active site than p38α that may allow for the development of specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).

This kinase perturbation phospho-profile clustering (KiPPC) method is broadly applicable for kinases for which some annotated substrates have been identified and for which specific inhibitors are available. It could be advantageous to perturb the system with multiple inhibitors, inhibitor concentrations, or timepoints to separate off-and on-target inhibitor effects and to develop more specific substrate profiles to feed into the clustering algorithm.

However, we have not yet tested the ability of phosphorylation site mutants to rescue these effects, which would more conclusively determine their contributions but is beyond the scope of this study.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells requires the activity of several cellular pathways for successful replication. One such pathway, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, is required for virus replication and disease pathogenesis. Here, we applied systems biology approaches to understand how MAPK pathways benefit SARS-CoV-2 replication to inform the development of novel COVID-19 drug therapies.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Comparisons across SARS-CoV-2 proteomics studies reveal pathways consistently regulated across species and cell types</title><p>A) Schematic of experimental design;
