<abstract>
<p id="P2">Damage in COVID-19 results from both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its triggered overreactive host immune responses. Therapeutic agents that focus solely on reducing viral load or hyperinflammation fail to provide satisfying outcomes in all cases. Although viral and cellular factors have been extensively profiled to identify potential anti-COVID targets, new drugs with significant efficacy remain to be developed. Here, we report the potent preclinical efficacy of ALD-R491, a vimentin-targeting small molecule compound, in treating COVID-19 through its host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions. We found that by altering the physical properties of vimentin filaments, ALD-491 affected general cellular processes as well as specific cellular functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, ALD-R491 reduced endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and exosomal release, thus impeding the entry and egress of the virus; increased the microcidal capacity of macrophages, thus facilitating the pathogen clearance; and enhanced the activity of regulatory T cells, therefore suppressing the overreactive immune responses. In cultured cells, ALD-R491 potently inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2-mediated pseudoviral infection. In aged mice with ongoing, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, ALD-R491 reduced disease symptoms as well as lung damage. In rats, ALD-R491 also reduced bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate a unique mechanism and significant therapeutic potential for ALD-R491 against COVID-19. We anticipate that ALD-R491, an oral, fast-acting, and non-toxic agent targeting the cellular protein with multipart actions, will be convenient, safe, and broadly effective, regardless of viral mutations, for patients with early- or late-stage disease, post-COVID complications and other related diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed and rolled out to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, however the infection-blocking immunity induced by vaccination has been shown to wane quickly, even though disease-reducing immunity may be long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Vaccination primarily generates IgG antibodies that circulate in the blood, not IgA antibodies in the mucosa of the respiratory tract which are a critical component of the mucosal immunity that prevents SARS-CoV-2 from initiating its infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The spike mRNA-based vaccination induces strong, persistent antibody responses but accompanied by a limited or absent T-cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In addition, the virus has now demonstrated an ability to rapidly mutate during its transmission and to generate mutants that not only provide enhanced infectivity, but also an acquired ability to escape from therapeutic antibodies and those induced by infection or vaccination. Several Variants of Concern (VOCs) have emerged within a short period of time, especially the Delta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) that is currently fueling a resurgence of new infection in fully vaccinated population. This virus appears to present a persistent problem despite vaccines, and therefore effective therapeutics are critically needed.</p>
<p id="P4">To date, most therapeutic interventions have been focused either on stopping viral infection or reducing virus-induced hyper-inflammation. Antiviral approaches can be virus-directed or host-directed. Virus-directed approaches include blocking viral entry, preventing maturation of viral proteins, and disrupting the viral RNA-synthesis machinery. All face challenges from the rapid viral mutations that could make them ineffective over time. In addition, these types of agents must be given early during an infection to be effective, as viral load has been shown to peak on or before symptom onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) with very few infectious viruses present in the upper respiratory tract 10 days after the onset of symptoms, even without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A delayed or longer anti-viral treatment in the course of COVID-19 has been shown to lead a worse outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), because it is the overactivated host immune system, not the virus itself, that is driving the progression and the development of serious complications. However, immunomodulators have shown minimal effects and corticosteroids, moderate effects only if given at the right timing, otherwise worsening the disease. Host-directed antiviral approaches have attracted attention because targeting host proteins offers broad-spectrum anti-viral actions that are hard for virus to evade through mutation. The host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 have been extensively profiled and a large quantity of existing compounds have been screened for potential antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). So far, however, no repurposed antiviral drugs addressing these host factors have shown significant efficacy in clinical trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">An ideal anti-COVID agent would be able to both eliminate the virus and restore balance to the immune system. Several existing drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and ivermectin that exhibit some degree of synergistic antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, have been repurposed to treat COVID-19, however, the results have been controversial or inconclusive. Whether applied in early disease to prevent progression, or in late stage to reduce morbidity and mortality, therapeutics with new mechanisms are urgently needed to tackle the multifaceted and inter-related nature of pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 infection.</p>
<p id="P6">Vimentin, an evolutionarily very conserved intermediate filament protein with diverse functions in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), has been proposed as a host-directed therapeutic target for COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Vimentin facilitates viral infection by serving as a co-receptor and a component of the cellular transportation machinery for viral entry, trafficking and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Vimentin is also specifically involved in inflammatory responses, where it forms a superstructure inside regulatory T cells that mechanically regulate the switch of the cells between active and inactive status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and provides a scaffold structure that enables the NLRP3 inflammasome to assemble, activate, and contribute to inflammation and lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Targeting vimentin is unlikely to generate mechanism-based toxicities because the protein has been widely recognized to be non-essential from embryonic development to adulthood after the first work in early 1990s demonstrated that mice lacking vimentin developed and reproduced without an obvious phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We synthesized a series of small molecule compounds that can bind to vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The lead compound ALD-R491 has shown many favorable safety features: it is fast-acting, fully reversable, has no cytotoxicity, and causes no change in the protein levels of vimentin and other proteins of major signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In this study, we explored the effects of ALD-R491 on vimentin structure and function, general cellular processes and specific cellular functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and evaluated the compound <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. The constellation of effects we observed strongly supports this oral small molecule compound as a promising host-directed therapeutic agent with novel mechanisms to address multiple pathological processes of COVID-19.</p>

<title>ALD-R491 reduces the dynamism of vimentin filaments and inhibits endocytosis, endosomal trafficking and exosomal release</title>
<p id="P8">To understand the impact of the compound-binding on the target protein, we first examined the distribution of vimentin intermediate filaments (IF) in live cells. Confocal immunofluorescence imaging showed a dynamic reorganization of intracellular vimentin network responding to ALD-R491 treatment. In the control cells, the vimentin IF formed bundle-like structures parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell, with a richer presence in the cell peripheral region and at the far end of cell than in the central region. In ALD-R491-treated cells, the vimentin IF retracted from the periphery with no structural changes visible at low doses but with an intricate, honeycomb-like reticulated structure formed in the perinuclear region at high doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This alteration was specific to vimentin, because the proteins of the same type-III IF family, GFAP and desmin, showed no structural changes to ALD-R491 treatment. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We next sought to determine how the altered organization of vimentin IF would relate to a change in the physical properties of ALD-R491-bound vimentin filament. We utilized the fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) technique to quantify the two-dimensional lateral diffusion of vimentin-GFP in the cells treated with the compound or the solvent control. We found that the time required for fluorescence recovery in the photo-bleached region was significantly longer in the ALD-R491 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, 1C</xref>), indicating that the ALD-R491-bound vimentin protein had become less mobile or had a compromised dynamism.</p>
<p id="P10">Vimentin is involved in the trafficking of membrane and intracellular vesicles, so we hypothesized that a decrease in mobility or dynamism would impact subcellular processes related to material transportation. To test this, we used a liposome-mediated plasmid transfection method. To separate the effect on endocytosis from that on endosomal trafficking, we treated the cells with ALD-R491 during three different time periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). When present during the entire transfection process (full time) that impacts both endocytosis and trafficking, ALD-R491 reduced the levels of GFP reporter up to 50%, with an EC50 of 0.036 μM and EC90 of 0.19 μM. At 0.3 μM ALD-R491 reached its maximum effect of 50% inhibition (treated full time), and the inhibition rates of ALD-R491 on endocytosis (treated before transfection) and endosomal trafficking (treated after transfection) were 18% and 35% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results indicate that endocytosis and endosomal trafficking were very sensitive to ALD-R491 however neither of cellular processes was completely blocked by the compound, with endosomal trafficking impacted more than endocytosis.</p>
<p id="P11">Exosomes originate from the endocytic pathway and are released via the fusion of a multivesicular body (MVB) with cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Using a reporter system as well as a classic exosome purification method, we found that ALD-R491 inhibited exosome release from Huh7 cells in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Like the effects observed on endocytosis and endosomal trafficking, the maximal rates of inhibition on exosome release were plateaued at around 50% of non-drug levels. These data indicate that by altering the mechanical properties (“dynamism”) of vimentin filaments, ALD-R491 reduced multiple cellular processes that are related to viral entry, trafficking and egress.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>ALD-R491 blocks SARS-CoV2 spike protein-ACE2-mediated pseudoviral infection</title>
<p id="P12">Targeting the initial steps of infection, such as viral entry and de-coating, is an attractive antiviral approach, particularly for a host-directed antiviral mechanism with the objective of blocking virus-host cell interactions. SARS-CoV-2 gains access into cells through endocytosis after the engagement of its spike protein with cell membrane proteins. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the spike protein and is responsible for the initiation of infection, although other host factors such as TMPRSS-2 and neuropilin-1 may facilitate the viral entry process. We tested the antiviral activity of ALD-R491 by using a lentivirus pseudotyped with the human SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to infect HEK293 cells overexpressing human ACE2 protein. Because the pseudovirus expresses both GFP and luciferase, the infection efficiency can be continuously tracked by live imaging of fluorescence and quantified at the endpoint by measuring luciferase activity. Exposure of the cells to ALD-R491 resulted in a dramatic reduction in the pseudoviral infection at all dose levels during the whole infection process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 A-B</xref>), and generated no cytotoxicity even at the highest concentration tested (CC50 &gt;10 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We conclude therefore that this antiviral effect was largely due to a blockade of viral entry rather than subsequent steps after endocytosis because no antiviral activity was observed when the compound was given 2 h after the viral infection. Regardless of the level of viral load present, ALD-R491 strongly and dose-dependently inhibited pseudoviral infection, with IC50s of 13.5, 34.7 and 64.9 nM for the infections at MOI of 0.5, 5 and 50, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Clearly, ALD-R491 was highly selective (&gt; 154 at MOI of 50) and potent at blocking the spike protein-ACE2-mediated viral entry, the first step of SARS-CoV2 infection. Unlike virus-directed approaches aimed at blocking the binding of the spike protein with ACE2 receptor, which include anti-spike protein antibodies that may become futile as the epitope of spike protein continues to mutate, our host-directed approach blocks the cellular process that is used by the virus. As long as endocytosis remains the route for their cellular entry, the compound would be equally effective for all variants.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>ALD-R491 enhances macrophage’s pathogen-killing efficiency</title>
<p id="P13">Monocytes and macrophages are the most important innate immune cells in the host defense against infections from pathogens, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria. At the early stages of an infection, the innate immune system, in particular macrophage M1, is as the first line of defense that prevents pathogens that have entered the tissues from further dissemination. In addition to triggering an immune response and producing proinflammatory cytokines, macrophages effectively phagocytose these pathogens, directly destroying them inside the phagosome or lysosome. SARS-CoV2 can interrupt phagolysosome function and even hijack the phagolysosome to egress from infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found alive inside monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), suggesting an impaired function of these cells for pathogen clearance, and a problematic reservoir site that supports lingering infection. The key actor for macrophage microbicidal activity is NADPH oxidase in the phagosomes which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidase is a membrane-associated enzyme consisting of multiple subunits. Vimentin is known to bind with p47Phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidase. The association with vimentin makes the p47phox subunit separated from the enzyme complex of NADPH oxidase, restraining the enzyme activity thereby limiting ROS production and consequently reducing the pathogen-killing efficiency of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In the mouse peritoneal macrophages, we found that p47Phox was abundantly present in the cell periphery next to the cell membrane and colocalized with vimentin. The vimentin-binding action of ALD-R491 caused a dissociation of vimentin from p47Phox thereby increased the presence of p47Phox in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), increased the production of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and reduced the number of Salmonella survived in the macrophages by about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These results suggest a potential of ALD-R491 to increase the pathogen-killing capacity of macrophages. As viral evasion of host immune surveillance is believed to play a major role in disease severity and persistence, the enhanced microcidal function of macrophage by ALD-R491 could reduce the ability for SARS-CoV2 to survive once inside the macrophage, thereby decreasing the chance of viral persistence and preventing the escalation of inflammation and development of long-haul symptoms.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>ALD-R491 directly activates regulatory T cells</title>
<p id="P14">In cases where the innate immunity fails to clear the pathogen, the adaptive immunity is then mobilized against the infection. Although this will help control infection, the overactive immune response is the most important contributor to morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19. Among all immune cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the key enforcers of immune homeostasis, marshalling many other immune cells in concert to keeping inflammation in check. They prevent host tissues from damage from the pathogen-triggered excessive antimicrobial immune responses and promote healing to repair epithelial damage, and other tissue damage throughout the body. In severe COVID-19 patients, the levels of peripheral Tregs were found to be remarkably reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), which has led to a call for Treg cell-based therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and clinical trial (NCT04468971) of infusions of Treg cells. Vimentin has been previously identified as forming the ‘mechanical’ restraint structure inside regulatory T cells that regulate their switch between active and inactive status. Specifically, inside Tregs, the asymmetric partitioning of vimentin forms the distal pole complex (DPC), keeping the immunosuppressive molecules away from the immunological synapse that gets formed between Tregs and antigen-presenting cells, thereby restraining the function of Treg cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We hypothesized that ALD-R491 would interrupt the DPC’s structural integrity and directly activate Tregs to increase their dampening and balancing actions, thereby addressing and potentially solving the cytokine storm of COVID. In cultured mouse Treg cells treated with ALD-R491 for a short period of time (2 h), concentrations as low as 0.01 μM resulted in a significantly decreased proportion of inactive Treg cells that had intact DPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). When disassembled, DPC would release the immunosuppressive molecules, activating Treg cells. Indeed, Treg suppression assay in vitro showed an increased Treg activity in the presence of ALD-R491 at a low concentration of 0.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). These results indicated that the highly ordered DPC structure was very sensitive to ALD-R491 and Treg cells required very low concentrations of the compound to be activated.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Orally administered ALD-R491 shows therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV2 infection in aged mice</title>
<p id="P15">Both macrophages and Tregs are highly heterogeneous and plastic, and their functions <italic>in vivo</italic> are largely context dependent. We focused on whether their enhanced functions by ALD-R491 observed <italic>in vitro</italic> would translate into therapeutic benefit against COVID-19 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To evaluate whether the oral compound would have exposure in the lung tissue at levels sufficient to be effective, we first measured the distribution of ALD-R491 in tissues after oral administration. In rats gavaged with ALD-R491 at 30 mg/kg, the compound was rapidly distributed in various tissues, with the highest exposure in the gastrointestinal tissues as expected, enriched exposures in other tissues including the lung and lymph nodes, and minimal exposure in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The compound concentrations in the lung tissue 6 h after oral dosing maintained at levels as high as 1μM, which was a concentration more than sufficient for efficacy based on its effective concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic> (&lt; 0.1μM in multiple assays). These data provided the rationale for dose selection and supported a daily dosing treatment regimen.</p>
<p id="P16">Next, we tested the compound in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA model, in which the mutated SARS-CoV-2 virus can replicate in the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. The model generates more severe disease in aged mice, reproducing the age-related increase in disease severity observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In this study, we utilized aged mice (11 to 12 months) to best mimic the most severe viral infection in the most vulnerable population in humans. The compound was orally administered prophylactically and therapeutically.</p>
<p id="P17">Prophylactic treatment had no effects under the study execution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-F</xref>), however therapeutic treatment showed significant efficacy in multiple measurements. Under the therapeutic protocol, the aged mice were administered the compound orally one day after the SARS-CoV2 infection for 3 of the 5 study days on D1, D2 and D4 and then sacrificed on D5. Therapeutic effects were observed more prominently in the medium dose group of 10 mg/kg, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), lower lung congestion as assessed macroscopically at the necropsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), milder lung tissue injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and less diffuse alveolar damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) as evaluated microscopically in the histological examination. The lung tissues from mice in both the 10 and 30 mg/kg groups showed less inflammation and better-preserved alveolar structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). The viral loads in the lung tissues at the end of the study at D5 were at low levels with no difference among groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). The low viral titers at D5 were expected because in this model without treatment, the viral loads in the lung were shown to peak at D2 and to decrease significantly by D4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The viral titer at D5 in this study therefore was less meaningful in terms of antiviral efficacy since the virus in the surviving mice had been largely cleared regardless of treatment. The therapeutic efficacy seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly given that only 3 doses were able to be administered relative to a 5-day course due to site constraints during the pandemic, was very significant both in its endpoints and in its short treatment regimen started after productive viral infection. With its dual actions of host-directed antiviral and antiinflammation, ALD-R491 represents a unique promising oral agent that is worth further investigation as a therapeutic against COVID.</p>

<title>Efficacy of ALD-R491 in treating and preventing lung injury and fibrosis in a rat model</title>
<p id="P18">With the therapeutic efficacy demonstrated in a COVID animal model, we wanted to further evaluate whether the compound of multiple functions could be used to treat or prevent lung injury, and the injury associated lung fibrosis. In COVID‐ 19 patients with pneumonia or requiring intensive care, 42% or over 60% of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis are hallmarks of ARDS at advanced stages. Up to 25% of ARDS survivors develop physiologic evidence of lung fibrosis within six months. With the continuing rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide and the increasing populations of long hauler patients, an increase in lung fibrosis is expected in post-COVID patients. Antifibrotic therapies have been proposed for treating severe COVID-19 patients and preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), however the available anti-fibrotic drugs are not well-tolerated and would present especially high risk to COVID-19 patients. Vimentin is the major intermediate filament in fibroblasts, the cell type directly responsible for excessive collagen production and fibrosis. The roles of vimentin in tissue injury and fibrosis have been well-established in the literature. Citrullinated vimentin mediates development and progression of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Vimentin KO or inhibiting vimentin has been shown to decrease collagen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), reduce lung injury and protect the lung from developing fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">We tested the vimentin binding compound ALD-R491 in rats with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis models, using prophylactic as well as therapeutic protocols. In both protocols, ALD-R491 significantly ameliorated lung tissue injury and lung fibrosis. Bleomycin directly injected via intra-trachea into to the unilateral lung caused massive lung injury and severe lung fibrosis. Compared with the positive control treatment with BIBF1120 (Nintedanib), a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor marketed as a first line treatment for lung fibrosis, the treatment with ALD-R491 showed significantly improved body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), indicating a superior safety profile of ALD-R491. Both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment using ALD-R491 reduced bronchial and arteriole injury in the fibrotic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, 6D</xref>) and the fibrotic border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>), reduced damage and fibrosis in alveoli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, 6F</xref>). Interestingly, careful examination revealed that the Masson’s trichrome images for samples with comparable Ashcroft scores exhibited a remarkable difference in connective tissue staining between BIBF1120 and ALD-R491 groups, i.e., ALD-R491 group had a much less intense blue color (stains for fibrosis) than the BIBF1120 group had (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This result indicates that, when assigned comparable Ashcroft scores, the lung tissues from ALD-R491-treated animals had less fibers than the lung tissues from BIBF1120-treated animals, so the Ashcroft scoring on lung fibrosis for ALD-R491 failed to capture this improvement in visible histopathology (less blue) because it falls outside the density rubric of the Ashcroft scoring matrix (scores only density, not color). This discrepancy was further confirmed by collagen-I IHC staining, which showed the actual reduction in fibrosis measured by collagen-I deposition was more significant than that by Ashcroft score in the lung of mice treated by ALD-R491. Compared with vehicle control, both ALD-R491 and BIBF1120 reduced collagen-I deposition in the lung fibrosis core, with the reduction of collagen more significant in ALD-R491 group than in BIBF1120 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>). This was consistent with the markable difference in amounts of fibers (blue color) seen by Masson’s staining but not reflected by Ashcroft scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Although Ashcroft scoring underestimated the efficacy of ALD-R491 in reducing fibrosis, the results from all the evaluation criteria indicate that ALD-R491 has a superior safety profile and a therapeutic potential not only in ameliorating lung injury but also in preventing and treating lung fibrosis, all of which is directly relevant to use in COVID-19 and its complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">To address the multifaceted pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection, we are developing a new therapeutic agent with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory action by binding to vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This first-in-class mechanism of action is fundamentally different from that of any existing pipeline agent, or any repurposed drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Importantly, the antiviral mechanisms of ALD-R491 create multiple novel actions against viral infection: first, a blockade of spike protein and ACE2-mediated endocytosis and of endosomal trafficking and exosomal release, which are the cellular processes that are unlikely to be evaded by the virus even with mutations; and second, an enhanced ability of macrophages to kill pathogens, which is critical both for containing the viral spread at early stages and for clearing persistent viral presence after the acute phase of infection. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of ALD-R491 could also create multiple actions that are novel and different from existing agents, and highly sought for their specific potential against the hyperinflammation of COVID-19: a direct Treg activation, as shown in this study; and a potential inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as previous study suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The therapeutic effects of the compound on the aged mice with a full-blown, ongoing SARS-CoV2 infections is not only a proxy for its efficacy against severe disease, but also informs its use in the elderly and fragile, two groups of COVID-19 patients with the most concerning unmet need. The therapeutic and preventive effects of the compound on lung injury and fibrosis make it also applicable to patients with post-COVID complications. With oral administration, ALD-R491can be conveniently dosed and broadly accessible to non-hospitalized patients, a population that is growing rapidly as this first pandemic matures.</p>
<p id="P21">These remarkable actions can take place because the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves multiple cellular processes in various types of cells where vimentin is abundantly expressed, including the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (AT1 and AT2 cells), vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">The binding of ALD-R491 to vimentin altered the organization and dynamism of the filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, 1B</xref>), which impacted multiple cellular processes in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-F</xref>), leading to a blockade of the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin can function as an attachment receptor on the cell surface and assist membrane and vesicle transport at both anterograde and retrograde directions inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). It appears to be widely hijacked by viruses for facilitating their infection, as seen with both SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and SARS-CoV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Our study showed that ALD-R491 potently inhibited Spike protein-ACE2 mediated viral entry through a blockade of endocytosis, the first step of the viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). It has been demonstrated that newly assembled SARS-CoV2 particles in the host cell, rather than budding to exit, egress from the cells by fusing multiple vesicle body (MVB)-like structure with the cell membrane, resembling exosomal or lysosomal release pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Our study showed that vimentin regulated exosomal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and that ALD-R491 dose-dependently inhibited exosome release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), which could lead to a blockade of the viral egress. All these actions contribute to a multi-part host-directed antiviral mechanism that offers a multi-part blockage of the transportation machinery hijacked by viruses for productive infection. As the compound acts on cellular processes not the virus itself, it therefore applies to all the SARS viruses regardless of strains or mutations, which is especially advantageous because of the rapid evolution of current SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for future outbreak of other coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P23">ALD-R491’s ability to enhance microcidal activity of macrophages is critical not only for controlling the infection but also for reducing the virus-triggered escalation in inflammation. Monocytes and macrophages are phagocytotic innate immune cells present in the circulation and in the tissues respectively, serving as the first line of defense upon encountering pathogens. Macrophage infiltration in alveoli is a hallmark of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Alveolar macrophages express the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes that help the cells recognize and internalize SARS-CoV-2. The positive and negative transcripts of SARS-CoV2 have been detected or enriched in alveolar macrophages, monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), suggesting the existence of live SARS-CoV2 in the monocytes and macrophages. The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been found persistently present in CD16+ monocytes of post-COVID patients for more than a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), suggesting the failure of monocytes to clear the virus. It remains to be investigated whether monocytes and macrophages can support active replication of SARS-CoV2, as has been reported for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Regardless, monocytes and macrophages may still serve as a permissive system and/or as a viral reservoir, both of which are known to enable virus to spread to other tissues or anchor specifically within the pulmonary parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), especially when there is a long duration between the onset of symptoms and the development of respiratory failure (6–12 days), or a prolonged course (several months or longer) of syndromes in COVID long-haulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Compromised ability of monocytes and macrophages to clear pathogens in COVID patients might lead to the persistence of the virus inside the cells, escalating a proinflammatory response during the acute phase, and recurring injuries and lingering symptoms in the post-acute phase. Enhancing the ability of macrophages to clear pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), ALD-R491 could therefore be one of ALD-R491’s most distinct, significant, and unique therapeutic benefits in patients with COVID as well as with post-COVID syndromes.</p>
<p id="P24">Direct Treg activation a unique feature of ALD-R491 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The binding of ALD-R491 to vimentin physically disassembles DPC, therefore, directly activates Tregs. This activation occurs rapidly (less than 2 h), unlike other Treg activating mechanisms that require changes in signaling pathway or gene expression, which are indirect and slow acting in nature. For COVID-19 with its rapid disease progression, prompt intervention appears to be especially important, which makes the fast-acting ALD-R491 advantageous. In addition, Treg activation via vimentin targeting was shown not to alter homeostasis of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) and therefore would not cause general immunosuppression, which makes it fundamentally different from the use of steroids. Separated from its immune-related functions, Treg activation has been shown to have a major direct and non-redundant role in tissue repair and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Through directly activating Tregs and other mechanisms, ALD-R491 could not only dampen the overactive immune system without compromising its antiviral response, but also prevent tissues from damage and facilitate their repair. Reduced tissue injury by ALD-R491 has been consistently observed in our studies across different animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">Anti-fibrosis activity of ALD-R491 is a further additive to a complete view of its impact on COVID-19. Lung pathologies from COVID-19 patients and computed tomography scans of the chest in post-COVID-19 patients showed a significant increase in fibrosis score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Fibroblasts are the primary mesenchymal cells in lung tissues. Overactivation of fibroblasts is the direct cause of lung fibrosis. Alveolar fibroblasts in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exhibit a persistent activated phenotype with enhanced migratory and collagen-1 production capacities. Vimentin is the major intermediate filament protein in fibroblasts, promoting the motility and invasiveness of cell and the production of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Targeting vimentin has been shown effective in reducing lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). As lung fibrosis can develop and persist in patients that have recovered from severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), the antifibrotic activity of ALD-R491 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) should provide additional values against COVID-19 and its complications.</p>
<p id="P26">In summary, the vimentin binding compound ALD-R491 impacts multiple cellular processes as well as various types of cells that are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Its multi-part host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions and its broad preclinical efficacy and make the compound a promising drug candidate worth further development and exploration for the treatment of COVID-19 and other related diseases.</p>

<p id="P40">The 9 female rats in 3 groups with body weights from 195 to 214 g were orally administered ALD-R491 at 30 mg/10 ml/kg. At 1, 2, and 6 h after drug administration, one group of the animals were anesthetized and then euthanized using abdominal aorta exsanguinations, and their blood and tissue samples were taken. The concentrations of ALD-R491 in rat plasma, tissue, feces, urine, and bile samples were analyzed by the validated LC-MS/MS methods with the LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantification) concentrations of 0.500 ng/mL for plasma, 0.500 ng/mL (equal to 25.0 ng/g after conversion) for tissue. The concentration value below LLOQ was set as 0 for the purpose of calculation. Software of LabSolutions (Version 6.81 SP1) from SHIMADZU Company was used for outputting raw chromatograms and generating concentration and accuracy results of the plasma samples. WinNonlin was used for distribution data statistical analysis (including mean, SD, and %CV) of plasma and tissues concentrations. Microsoft Office Excel (2007) was used for tissue concentration column graphs.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 M10 infection in aged mice</title>
<sec id="S30">
<title>Animals and housing</title>
<p id="P41">Aged (11- to 12-month-old) female BALB/c mice were obtained from Envigo (retired breeders). The animals were housed in the animal facility at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, with 5 mice in each cage with food and water provided ad libitum, with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were acclimated for 7 days in the BSL-3 facility prior to any experimentation</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S31">
<title>Virus and model establishment</title>
<p id="P42">Baric laboratory generated the stock of SARS-CoV-2 MA10, a mouse-adapted virulent mutant created from a recombinantly derived synthesized sequence of the Washington strain. The virus was maintained at low passage (P2-P3) to prevent the accumulation of additional potentially confounding mutations. Mice were anesthetized i.p. with a combination of 50 mg/kg Ketamine and 15 mg/kg Xylazine in 50 μl, then infected i.n. with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of sequence- and titer-verified SARS-CoV-2 MA10 in 50 μl of DMEM diluted in PBS to the inoculation dosage</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S32">
<title>Experiment groups and treatment regimens</title>
<p id="P43">Eighty animals were used in this study., Ten animals per group were randomly assigned in 1 mock-infected vehicle treatment group and 7 virus (10<sup>3</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 MA10)-infected groups treated p.o. via oral gavage respectively with vehicle and ALD-R491 at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg in prophylactic protocol (dosing at -15, -5, +24, +48, +72, +96 h post infection) or therapeutic protocol (dosing at +24, +48, +96 h post infection).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S33">
<title>Procedure and endpoint</title>
<p id="P44">Daily clinical evaluation and scoring were performed including body weight and symptom. The animals that survived anesthesia were carried to the experimental endpoint. As the mice were continuing to lose weight at all doses and in both treatment arms and the disease scores were increasing, all animals were euthanized at 5 days post-infection. Euthanasia was performed by inhalational isoflurane (drop method) and thoracotomy, with removal of vital organs (lungs). Lung tissue was taken for assessments of titer, RNA, and histology. Serum was taken for downstream analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S34">
<title>Histopathological examination of the lung</title>
<p id="P45">Lung specimens were fixed in formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological assessments. Lung samples were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist for acute lung injury (ALI) and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The ATS ALI score is a weighted composite score based on the Matute-Bello rubric and considers neutrophils in the alveolar space, neutrophils in the interstitium, hyaline membrane formation, protein in airspaces, and alveolar septal thickening. All lung specimens were submitted for scoring; the pathologist scored all specimens that were deemed suitable. Thus, at least 6 lungs were scored in all conditions.</p>
<p id="P46">
<bold>Statistical analyses</bold> were performed by Kruskal-Wallis test (Titer), One-way ANOVA (Congestion score) or two tailed T Test (Weight loss, ATS ALI and DAD scores).</p>

<title>Animals and housing</title>
<p id="P47">Forty-five male SD rats of SPF grade were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. with the company certificate No.: SCXX (Jing) 2012-001 and the animal use certificate No. 33000800003683. The animals were housed in the Animal House Facility of the KCI Biotech (Suzhou) Inc. at a temperature of 20 to 26°C and a relative humidity of 40% to 70%. Fluorescent lighting was provided illumination approximately a 12 h light/dark cycle per day. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at KCI Biotech Inc. All experimental procedures were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines issued by KCI Biotech Inc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S37">
<title>Model Establishment</title>
<p id="P48">This study was carried out in strict accordance with the SOP institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium at dose of 50mg/kg. The skin in the neck area was disinfected, then the skin layers were carefully incised to have the trachea exposed. Bleomycin (BLM) was directly injected into left main bronchus at a dose of 3mg/kg body weight in volume of 1.0 ml/kg via a cannula. After the skin layers were closed, the animals were placed on an electric heat pad at 37 °C until they woke up from anesthesia before returning to holding cages with free access to water and diet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S38">
<title>Experiment Groups and treatment regimen</title>
<p id="P49">The modeled rats were randomly assigned into 5 groups (n=9 per group), treated p.o. via oral gavage respectively with vehicle at 5 ml/kg/day, with BIBF1120 at 100 mg/kg/d prophylactically (q.d., from Day 1 to Day 21) or therapeutically (q.d., from Day 8 to Day 21), and with ALD-R491 at 100 mg/kg/d prophylactically (q.d., from Day 1 to Day 21) or therapeutically (q.d., from Day 8 to Day 21). One day after the last dosing (Day 22), all animals were euthanized according to the standard SOP at KCI Biotech. The animals were perfused systemically with ice-cold saline, their left lungs were harvested and perfuse-fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution (3ml of each lung), then processed for pathological analysis.</p>

<title>Importance</title>
</caption>
<p>With the Delta variant currently fueling a resurgence of new infections in the fully-vaccinated population, developing an effective therapeutic drug is especially critical and urgent in fighting COVID-19. In contrast to the many efforts to repurpose existing drugs or address only one aspect of COVID-19, we are developing a novel agent with first-in-class mechanism-of-actions that address both the viral infection and the overactive immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. Unlike virus-directed therapeutics that may lose efficacy due to viral mutations and immunosuppressants that require ideal timing to be effective, this agent, with its unique host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, can work against all variants of the virus, be effective during all stages of the disease, and even resolve post-disease damage and complications. A further development of the compound will provide an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, its complications, as well as future outbreaks of new viruses.</p>
