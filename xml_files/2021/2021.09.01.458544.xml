<abstract>
<p id="P1">Numerous enveloped viruses use specialized surface molecules called fusogens to enter host cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. During virus replication, these fusogens decorate the host cells membrane enabling them the ability to fuse with neighboring cells, forming syncytia that the viruses use to propagate while evading the immune system. Many of these viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infect the brain and may cause serious neurological symptoms through mechanisms which remain poorly understood<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons. Our results provide important mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could affect the nervous system circuitries causing neurological symptoms.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">Viruses from diverse families, such as rabies virus, herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, orthoreovirus, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can infect neurons <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Viral brain infections are characterized by multiple neurological symptoms, including headache, fever, confusion, epileptic seizures, and loss of taste or smell. In more severe cases, viral brain infections can lead to encephalitis and meningitis, and potentially irreversible neuronal deficits such as paralysis and death. Most clinical symptoms originate from the death of infected neurons <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. However, some viruses do not kill their host cells, and the chronic neurological sequelae of these infections cannot be explained by the loss of infected neurons <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Other neuropathological mechanisms must therefore underlie the progression of these viral infections leading to brain dysfunction. In non-neuronal tissues, viruses use their fusogens to fuse with host membranes and enter cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Once expressed inside the host cell, the viral fusogens redecorate the cell membrane conferring the ability to fuse with neighboring cells. This results in the formation of multinucleated syncytia, which allow viral propagation ‘from within’, without the need for virion release into the extracellular space <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. As defined over 100 years ago by Ramon y Cajal, neurons are individual units that do not base their development or communication on cellular fusion, with the preservation of their individuality being critical for the correct function of the nervous system. It is currently unknown whether the presence of viral fusogens can cause neuronal fusion and the formation of syncytia, thereby altering the neuronal circuitry and function.</p>
<p id="P3">To address this question, we began by using the fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) fusogen p15, isolated from the baboon orthoreovirus (BRV), which infects the brain of these primates and causes meningoencephalomyelitis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. p15 is the only viral protein required by the BRV to form a syncytium <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, with no receptor protein on the host cell being needed to facilitate fusion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. To safely mimic the result of viral neuronal infection, we transfected p15 in embryonic mouse primary hippocampal neurons, and visualized the presence of fusion through the transfer of different intracellular fluorophores between neurons. Immediately after isolation, a population of neurons was co-transfected by electroporation with a plasmid containing p15 and another containing GFP; a second population of neurons was co-transfected with a plasmid containing mCherry and the empty control vector. The two neuronal populations were then plated together and maintained in culture for 7 days (7 DIV). Our results revealed that the expression of p15 was sufficient to induce neuronal fusion, as detected by the presence of neurons containing both the GFP and mCherry fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> first row, and B), a phenotype that was never observed when the control vector was co-transfected in the absence of p15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> third row, and b). To determine whether the fluorophore diffusion was caused by the fusogenic properties of p15, we generated an inactive version of this fusogen, p15Δ21-22, in which two residues of the N-terminal of the transmembrane domain were truncated <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, expression of this inactive fusogen completely abolished the fusion of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> second row, and b).</p>
<p id="P4">Neuronal fusion implies a temporary or permanent diffusion of cytoplasmic material between cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. To confirm that this was the case, we co-transfected neurons with p15 and the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede, which shifts from green to red fluorescence upon illumination with ultraviolet (UV) light (350 – 400 nm). After identification of interconnected adjacent green fluorescent neurons, we photoconverted the green Kaede fluorophore by applying brief pulses of UV light in a small region of one neuron (donor). Newly generated red photoconverted Kaede molecules rapidly diffused to the adjacent neuron (acceptor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 1</xref>). The diffusion of red Kaede was measured as a decrease in the red fluorescence within the donor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>), with a concomitant increase in the red fluorescence in the acceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figs. 1c, d</xref>), thereby conclusively demonstrating the existence of an active cytoplasmic bridge between p15-fused neurons. In the absence of fusion, red Kaede remained confined within the photoconverted neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a, and 1e-g</xref>). We then asked whether the fusion bridges allowed exchange of cellular components larger than fluorescent proteins. To address this question, we used the photo-activatable mitochondrial marker mito-mPA-GFP, which allows to visualize mitochondria movement. Indeed, in fused neurons, we observed diffusion of mitochondria from donor to acceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">We next asked whether the neuronal fusion induced by p15 was restricted to two adjacent neurons, or if it was a propagating event that generated syncytia with a larger number of interconnected neurons. To address this possibility, we co-transfected neurons with p15 and GFP and monitored the appearance of syncytia over a period of 7 days. The number of neuronal syncytia increased over time, appearing as clusters of interconnected GFP-positive neurons that progressively incorporated more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-e</xref>). Moreover, through live confocal imaging performed over a period of 50 hours, we observed the progressive appearance of GFP in surrounding neurons, revealing the occurrence of fusion events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). Fusion was observed between the somas of adjacent neurons as well as between the processes (<italic>i.e.</italic> dendrites and axons) of distant neurons, resulting in fusion bridges with variable lengths that could extend over hundreds of microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">To determine if the p15-mediated neuronal fusion capacity was also conserved <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains in which p15 and GFP were expressed simultaneously under the control of the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter (<italic>Pmec-4::p15</italic> and <italic>Pmec-4::GFP</italic>), which is active in the six mechanosensory neurons (ALM left and right, AVM, PVM and PLM left and right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> panel i and v). Similar to what was observed in mammalian neurons in culture, any fusion event with nearby neurons or tissues would be detectable by diffusion of GFP from the mechanosensory neurons to other cells. As predicted, we observed the appearance of additional GFP-positive cells in the head, mid body and tail of the animal, a phenomenon never observed in non-transgenic siblings or wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Based on its stereotypic location and morphology, we identified ALN as the most prevalent additional GFP-positive neurons. ALN are a pair of sensory neurons located in the tail of the animal that extend their axons in close association with the axons of the ipsilateral ALM mechanosensory neurons <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Other frequently GFP-positive neurons were the pair of interneurons LUA, which are located in the tail of the animal and extend anterior neurites in close proximity with those of the PLM neurons, and the mechanosensory neurons PVD, positioned in the mid-body of the animal with two extensively branched dendrites and a long axon <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Despite over 90% of the GFP-positive cells being neurons, we also identified fluorescence in hypodermal cells, which form a tissue in which the PLM and ALM axons are embedded and has a glial-like function <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, panel iv). Similar to mammalian neurons, the expression of the inactive fusogen p15Δ21-22 within mechanosensory neurons did not result in fusion with neurons or hypodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of p15 can drive the fusing of neurons with other neurons or glial cells that are located in close proximity, suggesting a possible pathomechanism of neuronal malfunction caused by orthoreovirus infection.</p>
<p id="P7">Orthoreoviruses can be transmitted from bats to humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, and SARS-CoV-2 virus is derived from bat coronaviruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes a respiratory illness, but increasing evidence reveal also brain infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Unlike p15, the spike S protein that functions as the fusogen of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must bind to a receptor protein, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), located on the surface of the host cell <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, and uses neuropilin-1 as a co-factor to enhance infectivity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Among other tissues, hACE2 is expressed in neuronal and glial cells in the human central nervous system <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Mouse neurons express mACE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, which shares 81.86% interspecies homology with the human protein but lacks key residues for spike S binding <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. For this reason, to study the neuronal fusion properties of the spike S protein, both spike S and hACE2 must be expressed in murine neurons. Using a similar approach as that described for p15, we independently electroporated two neuronal populations, one with a plasmid expressing GFP plus a plasmid containing a codon-optimized spike S protein, and the other with a plasmid expressing mCherry plus a plasmid containing the hACE2 receptor. The two populations were then plated together and cultured for 7 days. The expression of the fusogen spike S and its receptor hACE2 in adjacent cells resulted in the fusion of these neurons and the mixture of the fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> first row, and b). Unlike p15, the presence of the specific receptor was required to initiate cellular fusion, as expression of spike S or hACE2 alone did not generate any fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> second and third rows, and b). To determine whether the fusion of neurons was caused by the fusogenic properties of spike S, we used two fusion-inactive versions of this protein, the spike S-2P and the spike S-6P (HexaPro). First, we generated the spike S-2P variant containing two consecutive proline substitutions in the C-terminal S2 subunit <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. These two mutations retain the spike S in a prefusion conformation, blocking its fusion capacity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, this mutant form has been chosen for the creation of most available vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. The spike S-6P contains four additional proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P) that further stabilize the prefusion conformation, and increase protein expression and ability to withstand heat stress <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Our results indicate that none of these two versions of spike S induce neuronal fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). In addition to neuron-neuron fusion, we observed neuron-glia and glia-glia fusion events if fusogen and receptor were expressed in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Neurons could fuse through their soma or via contacting neurites, forming fusion bridges of lengths that could reach over 100 microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). The functionality of these fusion bridges was evaluated using the exchange of photoconverted red Kaede fluorophores between fused neurons. Similar to what we observed with p15, photoconversion of Kaede in a small region of one fused neuron (donor) resulted in the fast diffusion of red Kaede molecules towards the other fused neuron (acceptor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). These results demonstrate that fusion through spike S and hACE2 also generates functional bridges that allow the diffusion of proteins. Importantly, the fused neurons retained their morphology, extended processes, and remained viable for the duration of the experiment.</p>
<p id="P8">Finally, we tested whether p15 and spike S have the potential to cause neuronal fusion in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons and brain organoids. Human neurons and organoids were transfected with a fluorophore (mCherry or GFP) with either p15, spike S or the inactive spike S-6P, and compared with their respective controls expressing fluorescence markers only. Remarkably, we observed that both p15 and full-length spike S fusogens caused extensive neuronal fusion in both human-derived systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Importantly, the spike S-6P mutant also failed to induce cell fusion in cultured human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b and c</xref>) and brain organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Fused neurons can result in compromised neuronal circuitry and altered animal behavior, as previously shown for <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemosensory neurons that ectopically express endogenous fusogens <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. Our results demonstrate that neurons expressing viral fusogens acquire the capacity to fuse, potentially compromising their functional circuit properties while remaining viable. This previously uncharacterized event could explain at least some, if not most, of the neurological consequences of viral infections of the nervous system. Moreover, most of the current immunization approaches for COVID-19 are based on expressing the spike S protein in the host cells as an epitope to trigger the immune system response <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. These nucleic acid-based vaccines deliver the antigen encoded as mRNA, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>, or as adenovirus-enclosed DNA, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> and Johnson &amp; Johnson Ad26.COV2.S <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup> vaccines. The current versions of the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines encode the full-length spike S (spike S-2P) with two mutations that stabilize the pre-fusion conformation and inactivate its fusogenicity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Our findings demonstrate that it is critical to consider the fusogenic potential when designing any future vaccines in which viral fusogens are to be expressed in mammalian cells.</p>

Briefly, the hESCs were maintained on Matrigel (#354230; Corning) in Essential 8 medium (#A1517001; Life Technologies). hESCs were dissociated with Accutase (#AT-104-500; Innovate Cell Technologies) at 37 °C for 1 min and seeded on AggreWell 800 (#34815; StemCell Technologies) in Essential 8 medium with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM, #72308, STEMCELL Technologies). After 24 h, spheroids were collected and transfered into ultra-low-attachment plates (#CLS3471; Sigma-Aldrich) with Essential 6 medium (#A1516401; Life Technologies) containing dorsomorphin (2.5 μM, #P5499, Sigma-Aldrich), SB-431542 (10 μM, #1614, Tocris) and cultured until day 13. The spheroids were then collected and placed into Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6 well-plates with DMEM/F12 (#11330057; Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 1X N2 (#17502048; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The produced neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were passaged until day 30, and then replated on poly-L-lysine (10 μg/ml #P2636; Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin (20 μg/ml #23017015; Thermo Fisher Scientific)-coated plates and maintained in Neurobasal medium (#21103049; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Glutamax (#35050061; Thermo Fisher Scientific), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, #78133; StemCell Technologies), ascorbic acid (200 μM, #72132; StemCell Technologies), GDNF (20 ng/ml, #78139.1, StemCell Technologies) and cAMP (1 μM, #A6885; Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 2 weeks.</p>

<title>Electroporation and transfection</title>
<p id="P15">When required, murine neurons were electroporated using the Invitrogen Neon™ transfection system (#MPK1025, ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, immediately after dissection, isolated neurons were washed twice in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free PBS and resuspended in buffer R containing 1 to 2 μg of the DNA to electroporate. The conditions for the electroporation were voltage 1500 V, width 10 ms, and 3 pulses. Alternatively, the neurons were transfected after 7-12 DIV using the Lipofectamine 2000 (#11668027, Invitrogen) reagent as previously described <sup>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p id="P17">Murine neurons were fixed with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 10 min. Neurons were rinsed in PBS, and permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min. They were then washed with PBS and incubated in blocking solution (5% horse serum, 1% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, the neurons were incubated with the primary antibodies to GFP (#AB16901, Merck Millipore), mCherry (#ab167453, Abcam) and anti-MAP2 (#188004, Synaptic Systems), diluted in primary antibody solution (1% BSA in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. They were then washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken (#A-11039, ThermoFisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit (#A32732, ThermoFisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-guinea pig (#A21450, ThermoFisher Scientific) and DAPI (#62248, ThermoFisher Scientific) in the secondary antibody solution (5% horse serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the neurons were washed and mounted in Vectashield® Plus antifade mounting medium (#H-2000, Vector Laboratories). The staining protocol was slightly modified for human neurons, with fixing for 5 min, blocking with 5% (w/v) BSA (#A9418, Sigma-Aldrich) and staining for MAP2 only. Organoids were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature or 30 min at room temperature. PBS-rinsed organoids were permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (#X100; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30 min, followed by blocking in 5% (w/v) BSA (#A7906; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h. The organoids were then incubated with primary antibodies to MAP2 (#ab5392, Abcam) at 4 °C for 3 days. Following PBS washing, they were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (#A11039 or #A21437, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 3 days.

The animals were imaged with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope equipped with a Photometrics camera (Cool Snap HQ2), and analyzed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) and FIJI-ImageJ. Cytoplasmic GFP was visualized with 470/80 nm excitation and 525/50 nm emission filters. Image acquisition was performed using SlideBook 6.0 (3I, Inc) and processed using FIJI-ImageJ.</p>
<p id="P20">For live-cell imaging of Kaede diffusion in mammalian neurons, fusogen/empty vector-Kaede-transfected neurons were bathed in imaging buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, 0.1% BSA, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Neurons were visualized at 37 °C on a Zeiss Plan Apochromat 40x/1.2 NA water-immersion objective on a confocal/two-photon laser-scanning microscope (LSM 710; Carl Zeiss). For transfected neurons, a UV pulse was applied on a 5 μm x 5 μm region of interest (ROI). Photoconversion resulted in the emergence of a spot of red fluorescence that rapidly diffused through the soma and proximal dendrites of the neurons. Simultaneous green and red images were collected every 785 ms; 5 images were acquired before photoconversion and 50 images after photoconversion. Photoconversion and diffusion of the fluorophore were performed on neurons separated by 25 μm to 100 μm. In control conditions, UV light was applied first outside the neuron, 50 μm away from the soma, and then inside the soma.</p>
<p id="P21">Similarly, for live-cell imaging of mito-mPA-GFP diffusion on mammalian neurons, a UV pulse was applied on a 10 μm x 10 μm ROI. Photoconversion resulted in the emergence of green mitochondria that slowly moved from one neuron to the other along the fusion bridge. Green images were collected every 5 min; 72 images were acquired before photoconversion and one last image was acquired 13 h later.</p>
