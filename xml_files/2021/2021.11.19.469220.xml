<abstract>
<p id="P1">As an inherited disorder characterized by severe pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis (CF) could be considered a comorbidity for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Instead, CF seems to constitute an advantage in COVID-19 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P2">To clarify whether host factors expressed by the CF epithelia may influence COVID-19 progression, we investigated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor and coreceptors in primary airway epithelial cells. We found that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and localization are regulated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels. Consistently, our results indicate that dysfunctional CFTR channels alter susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in reduced viral infection in CF cells. Depending on the pattern of ACE2 expression, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein induced high levels of Interleukin (IL)-6 in healthy donor-derived primary airway epithelial cells but a very weak response in primary CF cells. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that CF condition is unfavorable for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<body>
<p id="P3">The genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes 28 proteins, including four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral entry through binding of the ACE2 receptor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Once the S protein has bound the ACE2 receptor, it is processed by several proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin, which promote priming of the S protein and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily targets the airway epithelia. In some cases, infection leads to bilateral pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage, which in turn may promote acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in subjects with comorbidities. Moreover, the onset of a cytokine storm, during which interleukin (IL)-6 plays a key role in morbidity, has been described in subcohorts of COVID-9 patients with poor prognosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. CD13 is a transmembrane metalloprotease coregulated with ACE2 in various primate and human tissues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> that has also recently been proposed as a potential coreceptor of SARS-CoV-2 involved in viral entry and immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, CD13 activation has been associated with the release of high levels of IL-6 in different cell models<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">CF is caused by mutations in the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene, which encodes a chloride and bicarbonate channel widely expressed in human epithelia. Loss of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression or function in airway epithelia is associated with reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and dehydration. This process has been suggested as the initiating event of CF airway disease pathogenesis, which is characterized by severe impairment of lung function<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. CF could therefore be considered an unfavorable comorbidity in patients with COVID-19, particularly considering that other respiratory viral infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (H1N1), lead to a rapid deterioration of lung function and increased mortality in CF patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">However, several studies conducted on Belgian<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, French<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>, Spanish<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> and Italian<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> cohorts of CF patients have reported that CF seems to protect against COVID-19. Even though age distribution has been proposed as a major confounding factor for incidence calculation in these studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, the European Society of Cystic Fibrosis (ECFS) recently concluded that the case fatality rate associated with COVID-19 in CF patients was lower than in the general population. On the other hand, considering data that emerged from the French and Italian cohorts, it should not be dismissed that post lung transplant patients exhibited more severe manifestations in response to COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Since 51.2% of patients registered in the ECFS patient registry are adults<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, the possibility that the favorable COVID-19 disease outcome could be dependent only on pediatric age is questionable.</p>
<p id="P7">Therefore, our hypothesis was that some specific host factors associated with CF may influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that TMEM16F, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channel, plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and syncytia formation in lung epithelial cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, may be actively involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Furthermore, it has already been established that CFTR can regulate other apical proteins, including the ion channel solute carrier family 26 member 9 (SLC26A9)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, the potassium channel KIR 1.1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog protein (PTEN)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, and receptors such as the A2B adenosine receptor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. These regulatory functions of CFTR might be due to direct binding of CFTR to other proteins or indirect binding through PDZ-interacting domains through the adapter proteins ezrin, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF)1 and NHERF2. Given all of these possibilities, we investigated the role of CFTR in regulating SARS-CoV-2 receptors and coreceptors.</p>
<p id="P8">We first explored the expression of <italic>ACE2, TMRPSS2,</italic> and <italic>CD13</italic> in CF primary airway epithelial cells. <italic>ACE2</italic> mRNA expression was reduced in both primary bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) isolated from CF patients homozygous for the F508del <italic>CFTR</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) compared to healthy donor-derived tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Consistent with the mRNA data, ACE2 and CD13 protein levels were remarkably lower in primary well-differentiated CF-HNECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, no change in <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> expression was observed between CF and nonCF primary HNECs, either in terms of mRNA or protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a and b</xref>). To determine whether <italic>CFTR</italic> expression influences <italic>ACE2</italic> expression, we utilized different cell models in which gene editing approaches were applied to modulate <italic>CFTR</italic> expression. In particular, we employed the human lung adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cell line in which <italic>CFTR</italic> was stably silenced by a short hairpin (sh)RNA (SH3 cells), as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, the well-established CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-, in which <italic>CFTR</italic> expression is almost undetectable, and cell lines derived from CFBE41o- cells expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> (CFBE41o- WT) or F508del-CFTR (CFBE41o- F508del). Finally, we used a human bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o- cell line expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> and edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach to obtain two supplemental cell lines carrying biallelic W1282X-CFTR or G542X-CFTR nonsense mutations.</p>
<p id="P9">The results unambiguously indicated that <italic>CFTR</italic> expression is associated with <italic>ACE2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In particular, CFTR-deficient SH3 cells displayed a remarkable reduction in ACE2 levels compared to both parental Calu-3 cells and mock-transfected cells, i.e. Alter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d and e</xref>). CD13 is not expressed in these cells. In contrast, the introduction of both mutated F508del-CFTR and wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> in CFBE41o- cells resulted in a substantial increase in ACE2 levels, accompanied by remarkable induction of CD13 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f and g</xref>). Then we assessed <italic>ACE2</italic> expression in 16HBE14o- cells in which the <italic>CFTR</italic> sequence was edited using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Consistent with the results from SH3 and Alter cells, we found that ACE2 protein synthesis was remarkably reduced in cells harboring nonsense-mutated <italic>CFTR,</italic> with undetectable levels of CFTR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h and i</xref>). Thus, it seems that variations in ACE2 expression are not associated with specific <italic>CFTR</italic> genetic classes of defect, such as Class II folding defect of F508del-CFTR, but rather, are more widely related to defective CFTR protein. Moreover, a well-established inhibitor of CFTR ion flux, thiazolidinone CFTR(inh)-172<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, partially reduced the expression of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h and i</xref>). Once again, CD13 protein levels were partially corepressed in these cellular models, particularly in the G542X-CFTR cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h and i</xref>), confirming that CD13 expression is coregulated with ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells, as previously demonstrated in other cell types<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">We therefore decided to investigate whether the subcellular distribution of the ACE2 receptor is dependent on CFTR expression, localization and function considering that the CFTR channel exists in a multiprotein complex that regulates CFTR channel activity but may also regulate the localization and function of other proteins on the plasma membrane<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. For this purpose, we investigated the subcellular distribution of ACE2 in different CFBE41o-cell models using immunofluorescence. In CFBE41o- cells, both CFTR and the ACE2 receptor were not localized to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The typical plasma membrane localization of the ACE2 receptor was instead observed in CFBE41o- (WT) cells expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The expression of wild-type CFTR protein on the plasma membrane was strictly associated with the subcellular distribution of ACE2, as confirmed by Manders M1 and Pearson’s coefficients, parameters sustaining the correlation between the intracellular localization of CFTR and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, in CFBE41o- cells expressing F508del-<italic>CFTR,</italic> which encodes an unfolded CFTR protein that is primarily retained in the ER, ACE2 was almost entirely localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Once again, the colocalization of ACE2 with CFTR was validated by Manders M1 and Pearson’s coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The redistribution of ACE2 to the ER was confirmed by subcellular quantification, since the ratio between plasma membrane fluorescence and ER fluorescence was significantly reduced in CFBE41o- (F508del) cells compared to CFBE41o- (WT) and 16HBE14o- cells, where both CFTR and ACE2 proteins were primarily localized on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, III). Next, we examined whether <italic>ACE2</italic> expression and localization could be only influenced by <italic>CFTR</italic> expression, or whether CFTR channel function could play a role. To this aim, we incubated 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- (WT) cells re-expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> with CFTR(inh)-172 for 24 hours. Our data indicated that the prolonged functional block of ion efflux from CFTR does not lead to modification of the subcellular localization of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To exclude the possibility that mislocalization of the ACE2 receptor into the ER is due to alterations in the membrane trafficking pathway associated with the unfolded CFTR protein, we investigated the subcellular localization of CFTR-interactor NHERF1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. In the absence of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression, NHERF1 localizes closely to the plasma membrane in CFBE41o- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). NHERF1 normally binds to the CFTR channel through its PDZ domains. This interaction was indeed confirmed by the coefficients of colocalization in CFBE41o- (WT) cells re-expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, the typical localization of NHERF1 was perturbed in CFBE41o- cells expressing the mutated F508del <italic>CFTR,</italic> encoding a CFTR protein that is primarily retained within the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These results therefore support the hypothesis that the presence of a mutated CFTR channel, as well as the loss of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression, may induce mislocalization of the ACE2 receptor regardless of the membrane trafficking pathways.</p>
<p id="P12">In contrast to what has been observed for ACE2, the plasma membrane localization of CD13 was not perturbed by <italic>CFTR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To confirm the role of CFTR in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, we employed two complementary strategies, use of a pharmacological inhibitor of CFTR function and a miRNA-based approach to specifically downregulate CFTR production, using the CFBE41o- and Calu-3 cell lines. The chronic effect of CFTR(inh)-172 on the extracellular release of SARS-CoV-2 from infected CFBE41o-(WT) cells expressing wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>. We utilized a previously validated methodology for in vitro viral infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. The data obtained support the concept that inhibition of CFTR function is associated with a remarkable reduction in SARS-CoV-2 virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). For comparison, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 has also been investigated in the mutant CFBE41o-(F508del) and parental CFBE41o- cell lines. Using these two cell lines, which harbor nonfunctional CFTR channels, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was strongly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Regarding the miRNA-based strategy, our group and others have previously demonstrated that <italic>CFTR</italic> expression is under posttranscriptional control of different microRNAs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Since <italic>CFTR</italic> expression increased in response to antagomiR molecules against miR-145-5p<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, the exposure of bronchial epithelial cells to this miRNA might lead to <italic>CFTR</italic> downregulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> for localization of miR-145-5p binding sites within the CFTR 3’UTR). In fact, four miR-145-5p binding sites are present in the 3’-UTR of <italic>CFTR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Treatment of Calu-3 cells with premiR-145-5p significantly reduced the accumulation of <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Most importantly, treatment of Calu-3 cells with premiR145-5p remarkably reduced CFTR protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d and e</xref>). The conclusion of these experiments fully supports the concept that downregulation of <italic>CFTR</italic> can be achieved by a miRNA-mimicking strategy using premiR-145-5p.</p>
<p id="P15">We next assessed whether this treatment, performed on SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells, is associated with alteration of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The results revealed that pretreatment of Calu-3 cells with 100 nM premiR-145-5p is sufficient to dramatically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral production in a similar fashion to that observed by incubating Calu-3 cells with the CFTR(inh)-172 compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f and g</xref>). We observed partial inhibition of mature CFTR protein expression upon prolonged incubation (72h) of CFTR(inh)-172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h and i</xref>). This phenomenon has already been reported in other human cell lines, including K562 and SUP-B15<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>, and might explain the partial reduction of ACE2 observed upon CFTR(inh)-172 incubation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. As expected from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-e</xref>, western blot analysis of CFTR protein content in response to the different treatment conditions confirmed that CFTR synthesis was greatly inhibited by treatment with premiR145-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h and i</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">In addition, we evaluated the effect of the ACE2 ligand SARS-CoV-2 S protein on IL-6 expression. Although CF lung pathology has been established as a proinflammatory condition featuring elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines, in particular IL-8<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>, some clinical evidence suggests that IL-6 levels are extremely low in sputum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from CF patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>

Our data consistently showed that IL-6 mRNA expression was constitutively reduced in primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells obtained from CF patients compared to healthy donor-derived tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression in SH3 cells reduced expression of <italic>IL6</italic> mRNA compared to mock-transfected Alter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>). Most importantly, stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein led to a remarkable induction of IL-6 release in well-differentiated primary HNECs grown at the air-liquid interface derived from healthy donors but induced a very weak response in CF HNECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k</xref>). These data are in line with a recent report showing that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein increases IL-6 expression in macrophages isolated from nonCF subjects but not in CF cells<sup>

</sup>, strengthening the observations of the reduced expression and mislocalization of the ACE2 receptor in CF cells.</p>
<p id="P17">In conclusion, this work provides new insights into regulation of the expression and localization of ACE2 in relation to CFTR expression and function. This issue is of substantial interest for unraveling additional aspects in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that CFTR expression and function are directly correlated with <italic>ACE2</italic> expression and their interaction is necessary to place ACE2 receptor on the plasma membrane. Of note, our results show that CF airway epithelial cells constitutively express mislocalized and lower levels of ACE2 receptor than nonCF cells, which in turn leads to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. These results are in line with a previous report on TMEM16F<sup>

</sup>, strengthening the hypothesis that chloride channels are considerably involved in the SARS-CoV-2 biological cycle.</p>
<p id="P18">Given these findings, the use of chloride channel inhibitors or miRNAs against <italic>CFTR,</italic> such as miR-145-5p, is conceivable as a possible therapeutic strategy for preventing or limiting the adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.</p>

For ACE2, CD13, TMPRSS2 and β-actin analysis, protein extracts were loaded on Miniprotean TGX (4-14%) SDS—PAGE gel (Bio–Rad Laboratories) in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS) using Precision Plus dual color tag protein ladder (Bio–Rad Laboratories) to determine molecular weight. For CFTR analysis, protein extracts were loaded on Criterion XT (Bio–Rad laboratories) precast gels (3-8%) in XT Tricine buffer (Bio–Rad Laboratories) using Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope standards (Bio–Rad Laboratories). Gels were then transferred onto Transblot turbo PVDF membranes (Bio–Rad laboratories) at 20 V using Transblot Turbo equipment (Bio–Rad laboratories) for 5-12 minutes. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD13, β-actin) or 5% nonfat dried milk (PanReac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) for 90 minutes at room temperature and washed with TBS (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150□mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS/T) for 15 minutes. Membranes were probed with primary anti-human ACE2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab15348, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-TMPRSS2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (ab109131, Abcam), or anti-CD13 rabbit monoclonal antibody (ab108382, Abcam) in TBS/T with 5% BSA or mouse IgG<sub>2b</sub> anti-CFTR NBD2 (antibody 596, Cystic Fibrosis North American Foundation, Chapel Hill, NC, 1:2500 dilution) in 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, membranes were incubated with mouse anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (sc2357, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, dilution 1:2000) or donkey anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (RnD Systems) diluted in TBS/T for 90 minutes at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was measured using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio–Rad Laboratories), incubating membranes in ECL for 5□min at room temperature. Band intensity was evaluated by scanning video densitometry using a ChemiDoc imaging system (UVP, LCC, Upland, CA). Blots were then reprobed with monoclonal anti-β-actin-peroxidase clone AC-15 antibody (a3854, Merck, Saint Louis, MO, dilution 1:5000) in TBS/T for 90 minutes. For western blotting, cell pellets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P40 (IGEPAL), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Trizma base, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA plus protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mM PMSF for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method after precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), utilizing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. For CFTR analysis, 20 μg of the total proteic extracts were heated in Laemmli buffer (Bio–Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 37°C for 10 min and loaded onto a 3 to 8% Tris-acetate gel (Bio–Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio–Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using Trans Blot Turbo (Bio–Rad Laboratories) and processed for western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 596, against the NBD2 domain of CFTR (University of North Carolina, Cystic Fibrosis Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) at a dilution of 1:2500 with overnight incubation at 4°C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse immunoglobulin (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at room temperature for 1 h, and after washing, the signal was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumiGlo Reagent and Peroxide, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). After membrane stripping, a (β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to ensure equal loading of samples. For experiments employing the pre-miR-145, cellular extracts were obtained using Pierce RIPA Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then sonicated for 3×30 sec on ice at 50% amplitude using the Vibra-Cell VC130 Ultrasonic Processor (Sonics). Protein extracts were quantified using BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample was heated 37 °C for 10 min in 1× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 50 mM dithiothreithol (DTT) 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and loaded on 7 % SDS–polyacrylamide gel in Tris–glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS). Spectra Multicolore Broad Range Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as standard to determine the molecular weight. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Trans Blot Turbo (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For CFTR analysis, the filter was processed using the mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 596, against the NBD2 domain of CFTR (University of North Carolina, Cystic Fibrosis Center, Chapel Hill, NC, US) at a dilution of 1:2500 by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. After washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse immunoglobulin (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at room temperature for 1 h and after subsequent washes, the signal was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumiGlo Reagent and Peroxide, Cell Signaling).
