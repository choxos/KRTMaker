Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that limits inflammation, is known to impact on lipid availability, however whether this controls inflammation remains unexplored. We found that upon intestinal inflammation visceral adipocytes upregulate autophagy and that adipocyte-specific loss of the autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> exacerbates inflammation. While autophagy decreased lipolytic release of free fatty acids, loss of the major lipolytic enzyme <italic>Pnpla2/Atgl</italic> in adipocytes did not alter intestinal inflammation, ruling out free fatty acids as anti-inflammatory energy substrates. Instead, <italic>Atg7</italic>-deficient adipose tissues exhibited an altered oxylipin balance, driven through an NRF2-mediated upregulation of <italic>Ephx1</italic>. This was accompanied by a shift in adipose tissue macrophage polarization with reduced secretion of IL-10, leading to lower circulating levels of IL-10. These results suggest an underappreciated fat-gut crosstalk through an autophagy-dependent regulation of anti-inflammatory oxylipins, indicating a protective effect of adipose tissues for distant inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adipose Tissue</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>Autophagy</kwd><kwd>IBD</kwd><kwd>Colitis</kwd><kwd>Adipocyte</kwd><kwd>IL-10</kwd><kwd>Oxylipin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Autophagy is an essential cellular recycling pathway that engulfs cellular contents, including organelles and macromolecules, in a double membraned autophagosome and directs them towards lysosomal degradation. Many cell types, including immune cells, are reliant on autophagy during their differentiation and for their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Consequently, autophagy dysfunction is associated with the development of a variety of inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including its two predominant manifestations, Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), describe a complex spectrum of intestinal inflammation. Genome wide association studies identified autophagy-related genes as susceptibility alleles in IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Mechanistic studies revealed that ablation of autophagy in immune and epithelial cells promotes intestinal inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to the strong genetic association of autophagy and IBD, patients with CD often present with an expansion of the mesenteric adipose tissue around the inflamed intestine, indicating an active involvement of the adipose tissue in the disease pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Adipose tissues represent an important immunological organ harbouring a variety of immune cells, which are highly adapted to live in lipid-rich environments, such as adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Lean adipose tissues are predominantly populated by tissue-resident M2-type ATMs, while inflammation, such as induced by obesity, subverts their homeostatic functions and promotes pro-inflammatory M1-type polarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Polarization and function of ATMs depend on the integration of a variety of inflammatory and metabolic signals. M2-type macrophages rely on the availability and uptake of lipids and the subsequent metabolization of free fatty acids (FFA) compared to M1-type macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids, so called oxylipins, which are produced through enzymatic lipid oxidation can be released from adipocytes to modify macrophage cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Oxylipins have been widely described as regulatory lipid mediators that regulate inflammatory processes and resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. It is plausible that both availability of energy substrates such as FFA and signalling through oxylipin mediators will modulate immune responses. Autophagy contributes to FFA release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, however, to-date, little is known about the impact of autophagy in adipocytes on these metabolic cues and whether these may affect inflammation.</p><p id="P4">Here, we sought to investigate the impact of adipocyte autophagy on the immune system during inflammation of a distant organ, the intestine. We observed that autophagy is induced in mature adipocytes upon dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation, and that loss of autophagy in adipocytes exacerbated gut inflammation. Mechanistically, while autophagy in mature adipocytes is required for the optimal release of FFA during inflammation, this was not causative for increased intestinal inflammation. Instead, loss of adipocyte autophagy stabilized the oxidative stress master transcription factor NRF2 and promoted the oxylipin pathway activity shifting the balance of intra-tissual oxylipins. Local oxylipin dysbalance limited the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 from ATMs, aggravating intestinal inflammation. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of autophagy in adipocytes regulating local oxylipins that promote the anti-inflammatory fat-gut crosstalk, highlighting the importance of inter-tissual control of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>DSS-induced intestinal inflammation promotes autophagy in adipose tissues</title><p id="P5">To investigate whether autophagy in mature adipocytes is altered in response to intestinal inflammation, we deployed a mouse model of intestinal inflammation evoked by the administration of DSS in drinking water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, treatment with DSS led to an increased histopathological inflammation, shortened colon length, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and elevated circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-D</xref>). In addition, DSS treatment resulted in a significantly higher infiltration of immune cells in the inflamed colon, predominantly of myeloid origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>). Furthermore, DSS colitis reduced body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and in line with that, visceral adipose tissue mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as serum FFA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To assess changes in autophagy levels, adipose tissue explants from water- or DSS-treated animals were cultured in the absence or presence of lysosomal inhibitors and the accumulation of the lipidated autophagosomal marker LC3 protein (LC3-II) was quantified. DSS-induced intestinal inflammation substantially increased autophagic flux in mesenteric and in gonadal white adipose tissue (mWAT and gWAT, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that both adipose tissues proximal and distal to the intestine are responsive to the inflammation. To validate that adipocytes, but not other adipose tissue-resident cell types, contribute to the increased autophagic flux in the adipose tissue, we first prepared adipose tissue for transmission electron microscopy. Autophagosomal double membrane structures were readily identified in adipocytes from DSS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, enriched adipocytes fractions increased the expression of several <italic>Atg8</italic> homologues upon DSS colitis, further demonstrating an induction of autophagy in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, the adipocyte-depleted stromal vascular fraction containing other adipose tissue-resident immune and stromal cells showed no transcriptional changes in <italic>Atg8</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that autophagy is induced in adipocytes in response to DSS-induced intestinal inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Loss of adipocyte autophagy exacerbates intestinal inflammation</title><p id="P7">Given the increased adipose autophagy we observed as reaction to intestinal inflammation, we next investigated whether loss of autophagy in adipocytes affects intestinal inflammation. To exclude developmental effects of autophagy loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we used a tamoxifen-inducible knockout mouse model to ablate the essential autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> specifically in mature adipocytes (<italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic>) in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Tamoxifen administration led to the significant reduction of <italic>Atg7</italic> transcript levels in visceral adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This deletion was further confirmed at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, the adipocyte-specific loss of ATG7 resulted in the interruption of conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) confirming effective disruption of the autophagic process in adipose tissue. Having confirmed efficient deletion of <italic>Atg7</italic> and disruption of autophagic flux in adipocytes, we next compared the effects of autophagy loss in adipocytes in steady state and DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In all assessed parameters, loss of adipocyte autophagy in steady state mice had no effects on intestinal immune homeostasis. In contrast, <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice showed an increased loss of body weight in comparison to littermate controls upon DSS-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice treated with DSS had significantly shorter colon when compared to their wild-type littermates during acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Blinded histopathological assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> confirmed that DSS-treated <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice exhibited more severe tissue damage accompanied by increased inflammation and reduced features of repair throughout the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with an increased inflammatory response, we found increased gene expression of alarmins such as <italic>Il1a</italic> and <italic>Il33</italic>, pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>Tnfa, Ptx3, Ifng</italic> and the IFNγ-regulated chemokine <italic>Cxcl9</italic> in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Although total CD45+ immune cells numbers were comparable between adipocyte autophagy-deficient mice and littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), DSS-inflamed <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice showed an increased frequency of monocytes infiltrating the intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). In particular, the number of MHCII-expressing, inflammatory monocytes were increased in the lamina propria of <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). This phenotype is in line with the fact that autophagic flux was predominantly induced in adipose tissues upon intestinal damage by DSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) suggesting an important function of adipocyte autophagy during intestinal inflammation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of adipocyte autophagy exacerbates intestinal inflammation in the acute phase of DSS-induced colitis.</p><p id="P8">Since intestinal inflammation induced by DSS is self-resolving, we assessed the impact of adipocyte autophagy loss during resolution of the inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Two weeks after initial DSS administration, we did not find any differences in colon length between <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> and littermate controls and, equally there were no significant histopathological differences observed between the groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B-C</xref>). Interestingly, frequencies and total numbers of colonic FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) were decreased in adipocyte autophagy-deficient animals compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>), despite not affecting disease recovery. Intestinal FOXP3+ Tregs are classified into three distinct subsets based on co-expression of TH<sub>2</sub> and TH<sub>17</sub> transcription factors GATA3<sup>+</sup> and RORgt<sup>+</sup>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While all populations tended to be diminished in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice, only RORgt<sup>-</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). These data suggest that adipocyte autophagy is dispensable for the resolution of DSS-induced inflammation but may affect expansion of intestinal Tregs in response to intestinal tissue injury.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Intestinal inflammation promotes a lipolytic transcriptional profile in primary adipocytes</title><p id="P9">At this point, it remained unclear how adipocytes regulate intestinal inflammation. We hypothesized that visceral adipocytes would alter their transcriptional inflammatory profile during intestinal inflammation. To test this, visceral adipocytes were collected from wild-type and <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice treated with water or DSS and subjected to RNA sequencing. Since we anticipated sex-specific differences in adipocyte transcription profiles, we included the same number of male and female mice in each experimental group. The treatment clearly separated the experimental groups in the principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, sex-specific transcriptional changes explained ~33% of the dataset variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Next, we compared non-inflamed to inflamed adipocytes by regressing genotype and sex to identify the impact of intestinal inflammation on the adipocyte transcriptome. More than 4700 genes were differentially regulated between these states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), among which 2415 were significantly upregulated and 2333 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment in several pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Confirming our earlier results that adipocyte autophagy is affected by DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), intestinal inflammation led to an enrichment of genes involved in macroautophagy in visceral adipocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), including an increased expression of several <italic>Atg8</italic> homologues (<italic>Gabarap, Gabarapl1, Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). In addition, genes related to fatty acid metabolism were enriched in visceral adipocytes during intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, genes encoding key proteins involved in the lipolytic pathway, <italic>Adrb3, Pnpla2, Lipe</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic>, were upregulated upon intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting a change in the lipolytic status of the adipocytes. Similar to cachexic conditions, an increase of lipolytic genes (<italic>Lipe, Pnpla2</italic>) and simultaneous decrease of lipogenic genes (<italic>Dgat2, Mogat2, Lpl</italic>) is observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We confirmed protein levels of these enzymes and found that DSS-induced colitis increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and the expression of ATGL, two key enzymes in the lipolytic pathway, in line with increased lipolytic activity from the adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Overall, intestinal inflammation leads to a broad transcriptional response in visceral adipocytes, altering autophagy and fatty acid metabolism, which are reminiscent of a cachexic response phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Based on their main function in lipid provision, we hypothesized that autophagy may post-transcriptionally affect the release of FFA from adipocytes and thus may control nutrient availability to immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Adipocyte autophagy regulates FFA secretion</title><p id="P10">Recent reports implicated autophagy in mature adipocytes in the secretion of FFA in response to β-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To confirm the importance of adipocyte autophagy for optimal lipolytic output, adipose tissue explants were stimulated with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol and FFA levels were quantified. As expected, FFA secretion was reduced upon lipolysis stimulation in autophagy-deficient as compared to autophagy-proficient adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). TNFα is a crucial cytokine for human and murine IBD pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and can affect adipose tissue through inhibition of lipogenesis and by promoting FFA secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Since circulating TNFα levels were elevated during DSS colitis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), we investigated its effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism. Expression of the gene encoding for TNF receptor 1, <italic>Tnfrsf1a,</italic> was upregulated during DSS-induced inflammation in both genotypes, suggesting that TNFα-sensing was unaffected by the loss of adipocyte autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we assessed the impact TNFα on FFA release from adipose tissue explants from <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice or littermate controls. In the presence of TNFα, adipocytes increase FFA secretion, however strikingly, this was significantly blunted in autophagy-deficient adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with the decreased lipolytic activity of autophagy-deficient adipocytes, <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice exhibit reduced serum FFA levels compared to wild-type littermates upon DSS colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). While we established that autophagy could modulate overall FFA release, we next tested whether autophagy affects the production and secretion of specific FFA species. To investigate this, serum samples from water and DSS-treated animals were analysed by GC-FID. Confirming our initial findings, the serum concentration of many FFA species was reduced upon adipocyte autophagy loss, indicating that adipocyte autophagy controls overall FFA levels rather than specific FFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, loss of adipose tissue mass was comparable between both genotypes upon DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">It has previously been described that the adipokines leptin and adiponectin can influence intestinal inflammation in both pre-clinical and clinical situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we therefore assessed the impact of adipocyte autophagy loss on circulating levels of these adipokines. The levels of both adipokines were equally reduced in their circulation, paralleling the general loss of adipose tissue mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B-C</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that adipocyte autophagy blunts the release of FFA both upon β-adrenergic receptor- and TNFα-mediated lipolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Adipocyte lipolysis is dispensable for DSS-induced colitis severity</title><p id="P12">Based on our data, we hypothesized that differences in FFA availability may be responsible for a differential intestinal immune response. We therefore sought to determine the importance of adipocyte lipolysis during DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) by deleting the cytoplasmic lipase ATGL, a rate-limiting enzyme in the lipolytic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Using adipocyte-specific <italic>Pnpla2/Atgl (Atgl<sup>Ad</sup></italic>) knockout mice, we first confirmed that <italic>Pnpla2/Atgl</italic> was efficiently deleted in purified visceral adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>Atgl<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice lost comparable amounts of body weight upon DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), although adipose tissue loss was completely prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This data underlines that <italic>Atgl</italic>-driven lipolysis is a main driver for adipose tissue loss during DSS-induced colitis. Detailed analysis of the colon showed no changes in colon shortening, histopathological scores and expression of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5E-G</xref>). Similarly, there was no difference in the infiltration and presence of different pro-inflammatory immune cell population in the colonic lamina propria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5G-J</xref>). In summary, adipocyte lipolysis does not affect acute intestinal inflammation, suggesting that provision of FFA is unlikely to be the mechanism by which autophagy in adipocytes exerts its anti-inflammatory role.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Adipocyte autophagy loss promotes NRF2-mediated stress response and alters tissue oxylipin levels</title><p id="P13">To get a better understanding of pathways that may be affected by the loss of autophagy in adipocytes. We further analysed our transcriptomic data by splitting the dataset based on their condition and genotype. Reassuringly, visceral adipocytes from <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice had a strong reduction in <italic>Atg7</italic> levels and an increase in estrogen receptor 1 (<italic>Esr1</italic>) expression, due to the <italic>Cre</italic> transgene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6A-B</xref>). Across both treatment groups, we found a total of 32 genes being differentially regulated between WT and <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> visceral adipocytes. Six genes were differentially expressed under both water and DSS treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Due to the limited number of differentially expressed genes between <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> and wild-type adipocytes, we opted to look for altered pathway using ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which includes genome-wide alterations to given gene sets of major cellular pathways. Upon DSS-induced colitis, we found that the xenobiotic pathway, was significantly enriched in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>+<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). Enzymes which are known for their role in xenobiotic metabolism such as the large family of cytochromes P450 monooxygenases and epoxide hydrolases (EPHX) metabolize and detoxify exogenous substrates and mediate the production of oxylipins from endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids. The expression of many of the key genes involved in these processes are regulated by NRF2, a major transcription factor of the xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses. We found that <italic>Ephx1</italic> was consistently upregulated upon <italic>Atg7</italic> loss in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Among the genes that were enriched in <italic>Atg7</italic>-deficient adipocytes were several other NRF2-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). In agreement with an activation of the NRF2 pathway, NRF2 protein abundance was increased in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> visceral adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Specificity for NRF2 activation was further confirmed since only NRF2 target gene <italic>Ephx1</italic> was transcriptionally upregulated, whereas <italic>Ephx2</italic> which is not controlled by NRF2 remained transcriptionally unchanged in autophagy-deficient adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>).

In addition to the increase in EPHX1 and EPHX2 abundance in adipose tissues, we found that an enrichment of the oxylipin substrate docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and a trend for arachidonic acid (ARA) in serum of <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice 10 during DSS-induced inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>) suggesting a putative activation of the oxylipin pathway. We therefore tested whether the increased expression of EPHX enzymes would shift the balance of oxylipins in the tissue and, possibly, plasma. Indeed, loss of adipocyte autophagy alters the EpFA:DiolFA ratio towards a reduction of anti-inflammatory EpFAs in both mesentery and gonadal adipose tissues during DSS colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>). This was consistently observed for all analyzed DHA-derived EpFAs which are important substrates for EPHX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6K</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Strikingly, these effects appear to be locally restricted to the adipose tissues since no changes in these plasma oxylipin levels were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6L</xref>). In summary, these data suggest that loss of adipocyte autophagy activates NRF2 and increased the expression of EPHX enzymes promoting a local disbalance of EpFA:DiolFA. We hypothesize that this dysbalance in turn might alter the local inflammatory response in the adipose tissue to intestinal inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Adipose tissues increase secretion of IL-10 in response to DSS-induced colitis in an autophagy-dependent manner</title><p id="P15">Since the changes in EpFA:DiolFA appeared to be locally restricted, we next wanted to identify which soluble factors may impact on gut inflammation. Evidence suggests that stimulation of macrophages with EpFA promotes the production of IL-10, while abundance of DiolFA can quench IL-10 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, we next tested whether cytokine production from the adipose tissue may contribute to systemic inflammation during DSS-induced colitis and assessed the secreted cytokine profile from mesenteric adipose tissues. We found that the mesenteric adipose tissue increases the secretion of several cytokines including the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in response to DSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that, upon DSS-induced colitis, F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages are one of the major cell populations producing IL-10 in mesenteric and visceral adipose tissues, although mesenteric CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells appear to contribute as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). In adipose tissues of DSS treated mice, ATM frequencies were increased, but was comparable between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). EpFA can alter macrophage polarization and increase M2-type macrophage marker expression such as CD206<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In line with reduced EpFA levels in the adipose tissue, <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> ATMs expressed reduced CD206 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>). In addition, expression CD36, a lipid scavenging receptor which is commonly found on M2-type macrophages, was increased on the surface of ATMs in wild-type mice during DSS colitis and blunted in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>). Since ATMs are a prominent source of IL-10 production, we next tested whether IL-10 secretion from the mesenteric and gonadal adipose tissue was affected by adipocyte autophagy loss. Remarkably, disruption of adipocyte autophagy abolished DSS-induced IL-10 secretion from both mesenteric and gonadal adipose tissues, while having little impact on TNFα secretion, indicating that even adipose tissues that are not adjacent to the inflammation site contribute to the anti-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-D</xref>). Due to the important role of IL-10 in immune tolerance, we hypothesized that the reduction of IL-10 secretion from adipose tissues may translate into a systemic reduction of circulating IL-10 levels. Indeed, we found that while circulating IL-10 levels were significantly upregulated in DSS-treated wild-type mice compared to non-inflamed mice, their expression was diminished in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest that, in line with a decreased availability of anti-inflammatory EpFA, adipose tissues from adipocyte autophagy-deficient mice have an impaired production and secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 to DSS induced colitis compared to wild-type mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Immune cells reside within distinct tissue environments, however, the impact of local metabolic cues on inflammatory processes remains incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that autophagy in mature adipocytes contributes to the balance of intra-tissual oxylipin levels. Further, we demonstrate that adipocytes autophagy is part of the anti-inflammatory immune response by promoting the release of IL-10 from adipose tissues. Autophagy-dependent secretion from adipose tissues contributes to systemic IL-10 levels, and limits inflammation at a distant tissue site, the colon. Therefore, our study provides novel insights into a cross-tissue anti-inflammatory mechanism, enabling the development of therapeutic approaches to target this crosstalk.</p><p id="P17">While polymorphisms in autophagy genes are well established as genetic risk factors for IBD, little is known about autophagy’s role in adipocytes in this disease. We found that autophagy is induced in visceral adipocytes upon DSS-induced colitis, which was marked, among others, by a transcriptional increase of <italic>Atg8</italic> homologues during peak inflammation. These observations parallel findings during muscle atrophy, where the expression of <italic>Map1lc3b, Gabarapl1, Bnip3, Bnip3l</italic> and <italic>Vps34</italic> is regulated via FOXO3 activation, which subsequently controls autophagy levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. It appears plausible that a similar FOXO3-dependent mechanism occurs in adipocytes, especially since visceral adipocytes showed several transcriptomic and macroscopic changes reminiscent of a ‘cachexia-like’ phenotype. We hypothesize that intestinal-derived cues (such as TNFα or bacterial translocation) may promote systemic inflammation which is required for the induction of adipocyte autophagy and cachexia-like phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Early studies found that autophagy is crucial for the normal differentiation of adipose tissues <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

We extended this knowledge by our finding that adipocyte autophagy also regulates TNFα-induced lipolysis and by this may fine-tune lipolytic output of adipocytes upon inflammatory stress conditions.</p><p id="P19">We further demonstrate that adipocyte lipolysis during DSS-induced colitis is driven predominantly through ATGL. Somewhat surprisingly, loss of adipocyte lipolysis had no impact on body weight loss or colonic inflammation, thus raising the question whether adipocyte lipolysis is beneficial or maladaptive in the context of this disease.

Increased expression of EPHX1 was paralleled by a dysbalance in oxylipins shifted towards decreased levels of EpFA and increased DiolFA.

Since our data suggest a broader dysregulation of EpFA:DiolFA, it is likely that EPHX2, which was accumulated on protein level in <italic>Atg7<sup>Ad</sup></italic> adipose tissues, may also contribute to the conversion of oxylipin substrates. Increasing evidence suggests that macrophages are regulated by oxylipins in their environment.

The resulting reduction in systemic IL-10 levels prolongs pro-inflammatory programs at the distal inflammation site.

Adipose tissues were excised, cut into small 1-2mm pieces and immediately fixed in pre-warmed (37 °C) primary fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH7.2 for 2 hours at room temperature and then stored in the fixative at 4 °C until further processing. Samples were then washed for 2x 45 min in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature with rotation, transferred to carrier baskets and processed for EM using a Leica AMW automated microwave processing unit. Briefly, this included three washes with 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, one wash with 50mM glycine in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer to quench free aldehydes, secondary fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide + 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, six water washes, tertiary fixation with 2% uranyl acetate, two water washes, then dehydration with ethanol from 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% to 100% (repeated twice). All of these steps were performed at 37 °C and 15-20W for 1-2 mins each, with the exception of the osmium and uranyl acetate steps, which were for 12 min and 9 min respectively. Samples were infiltrated with TAAB Hard Plus epoxy resin to 100% resin in the AMW and then processed manually at room temperature for the remaining steps. Samples were transferred to 2ml tubes filled with fresh resin, centrifuged for ~2mins at 2000g (to help improve resin infiltration), then incubated at room temperature overnight with rotation. The following day, the resin was removed and replaced with fresh resin, then the samples were centrifuged as above and incubated at room temperature with rotation for ~3 hrs. This step was repeated and then tissue pieces were transferred to individual Beem capsules filled with fresh resin and polymerised for 48 hrs at 60 °C. Once polymerised, blocks were sectioned using a Diatome diamond knife on a Leica UC7 Ultramicrotome. Ultrathin (90nm) sections were transferred onto 200 mesh copper grids and then post-stained with lead citrate for 5 mins, washed and air dried. Grids were imaged with a Thermo Fisher Tecnai 12 TEM (operated at 120 kV) using a Gatan OneView camera.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Extracellular cytokine measurements</title><p id="P38">Serum samples were collected by cardiac puncture and collected in Microtainer tubes (365978, BD Bioscience). Samples were centrifuged for 90sec at 15,000g and serum aliquots were snap-frozen until further analysis. Global inflammatory cytokine analysis of supernatants of adipose tissue explant cultures and serum were performed using LEGENDPlex™ Mouse Inflammation Panel (740446, Biolegend). TNFα and IL-10 levels were measured by TNFα Mouse Uncoated ELISA Kit (88-7324-86, Invitrogen) and IL-10 Mouse Uncoated ELISA Kit (88-7105-86, Invitrogen), respectively. Adipose tissue derived cytokine levels were normalized to input tissue weight.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P39">Data were tested for normality before applying parametric or non-parametric testing. For two normally-distributed groups, unpaired Student’s tests were applied. Comparisons across more than two experimental groups were performed using One-Way or Two-Way ANOVA with Šídák multiple testing correction. Data were considered statistically significant when p&lt;0.05 (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001). Typically, data were pooled from at least two experiments, if not otherwise indicated, and presented as mean. Data was visualized and statistics calculated in either GraphPad Prism 9 or R software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS145517-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAfEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS145517-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_Legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAfEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patricia Cotta Moreira, Daniel Andrew and Mino Medghalchi from the Kennedy Institute animal facility for their excellent care and assistance of animal well-being.
