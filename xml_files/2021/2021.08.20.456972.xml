<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 has a broad mammalian species tropism infecting humans, cats, dogs and farmed mink. Since the start of the 2019 pandemic several reverse zoonotic outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred in mink, one of which reinfected humans and caused a cluster of infections in Denmark. Here we investigate the molecular basis of mink and ferret adaptation and demonstrate the spike mutations Y453F, F486L, and N501T all specifically adapt SARS-CoV-2 to use mustelid ACE2. Furthermore, we risk assess these mutations and conclude mink-adapted viruses are unlikely to pose an increased threat to humans, as Y453F attenuates the virus replication in human cells and all 3 mink-adaptations have minimal antigenic impact. Finally, we show that certain SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from circulation in humans may naturally have a greater propensity to infect mustelid hosts and therefore these species should continue to be surveyed for reverse zoonotic infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is thought to have emerged from an animal source in 2019 and rapidly spread by human-to-human transmission across the globe causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently by the airborne route due to its ability to efficiently enter cells in the upper respiratory tract. The spike glycoprotein is responsible for host receptor binding and membrane fusion of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) and is activated by TMPRSS2 protease expressed at the apical surface of the airway epithelium to mediate fusion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. In addition, compared to closely related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 spike contains a tract of basic amino acids at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be recognised by furin, enabling spike to be efficiently primed for fusion by TMPRSS2. This allows rapid fusion of spike at the cell surface and avoids restriction factors present in the late endosome and endolysosome <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">A series of molecular interactions between amino acids in the spike RBD and the interacting surface of ACE2 result in SARS-CoV-2 binding to human ACE2 with high affinity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 shows a broad host tropism and can experimentally infect many animal species, largely determined by the efficiency with which spike can interact with the animal ACE2 orthologues <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. For example, mice are inefficiently infected by early SARS-CoV-2 isolates unless they are engineered to transgenically express human ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 is adapted to murine ACE2 by serial mouse passage <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">From April 2020, reverse-zoonotic outbreaks (i.e. transmitted from humans into animals; also known as zooanthroponosis) of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms were reported in the Netherlands, the USA, France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Greece, Lithuania, and Poland <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Multiple reverse zoonotic events introduced the virus from farm workers into densely populated farms that then supported rapid transmission between animals <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Sequence analyses revealed several mutations in spike enriched after circulation in mink, most commonly the amino acid substitution Y453F or N501T; residues that map to the RBD of spike protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. From June to November 2020, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred among farmed mink in Denmark, with continuous spillover to farm workers and local communities with viruses harbouring Y453F <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. This large-scale outbreak resulted in an estimated 4000 mink-associated human cases and promoted the Danish government to cull all 17 million farmed mink in the country and several countries imposed total travel bans on the affected regions <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Of particular concern was the increased acquisition of spike mutations in mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses, as demonstrated by the Cluster 5 variant identified in September 2020 which had several additional changes in the spike glycoprotein including, Δ69-70 in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and I692V and M1229I in S2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Early data indicated a possible change in antigenicity whereby Cluster 5 variant virus might be less readily neutralised by antibodies in convalescent sera from individuals infected by earlier variants <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Ferrets are closely related to mink (both belong to the family <italic>Mustelidae</italic>) and have been used extensively as models for transmission of influenza virus due to their high susceptibility, comparable tissue tropism, and clinical signs similar to those seen in infected humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Consequently, ferrets have also been extensively characterised as models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission experiments and can support infection and transmission <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. During experimental infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets, several groups have independently reported mink-associated spike mutations Y453F or N501T <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Mink and ferret ACE2 are extremely similar with no amino acid differences that map to the ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 Spike interface (Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, both the Y453F and the N501T substitutions have also been associated with increased binding to human ACE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. It is possible these mutations may act to non-specifically increase binding to several groups of mammalian ACE2 proteins. A similar mutation N501Y, which is also associated with increased human ACE2 binding is often found upon mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 and is present in several human SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern showing signs of higher transmissibility <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. It has been hypothesised for influenza virus that increasing receptor binding avidity can result in non-specific antibody escape as the viral glycoprotein-host receptor interaction begins to outcompete that of antibody/viral glycoprotein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Y435F and N501T substitutions in the spike are detected in viruses transmitted between ferrets</title>
<p id="P7">In a previous study, we experimentally infected four donor ferrets and tested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit to individually co-housed naive animals <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. The early wildtype (WT) virus isolate, England/2/2020, which contains 614D, transmitted efficiently to 2 of 4 ferrets in direct contact with two infected donor animals (donor #1 and #2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, we sequenced the spike RBD of virus extracted from nasal wash obtained at early and late time point from the direct contact ferrets. Of the two transmitted virus isolates, at the consensus level, one had gained N501T in the spike protein while the other had a mixture of Y453F and N501T. Both Y453F and N501T have previously been associated with experimental ferret adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. To investigate the dynamics of ferret adaptation in more detail, virus samples were deep sequenced from various times point across the 2 successful ferret transmission chains (donor #1 to contact #1 and donor #2 to contact #2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In donor animal #1, the virus rapidly gained majority N501T with Y453F as a minor variant. However, by day 5, both mutations were present in equal amounts with no detectable WT spike. In the matched contact animal (contact #1), the transmitted virus population included a mixture of Y453F with a minority of N501T and Y453F continued to predominate between days 4-6. In Donor/Contact pair #2, again both mutations were detected but N501T predominated across both animals at all time points tested. N501T alone predominated in the day 2 nasal washes from the two donor animals that did not transmit to their direct contacts (98% in one, 94% in the other), with remaining reads showing WT spike <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. In the initial virus inoculum, N501T was detected at levels below 1% of total reads while Y453F was not detected at all (read depth ≈7000). No other consensus level mutations arose in any of the donor or contact ferrets anywhere else in the genome.</p>
<p id="P8">Interesting, by investigating all SARS-CoV-2 sequences isolated from mink reported on GISAID, we and others noted that N501T, Y453F, as well as F486L have independently arisen multiple times in mink, and in multiple lineages as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. These observations further imply that these mutations are strongly associated with mustelid adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Of all the mink-adapting substitutions, Y453F has been more frequently associated with spillback from mink into humans, including Cluster 5 in Denmark. To further investigate the effects of the Y453F substitution, we isolated virus from contact #1 from day 6 in Vero cells (‘Ferret P2’) and validated that the sequence change was maintained in the titrated virus stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The Vero grown virus stock was, in the majority, Y453F (<sup>~</sup>96%) with very minor variants, N501T and WT RBD also present (&lt;5%). Outside of spike, the virus contained an additional mutation, S6L in the envelope gene (E) which was present in &gt;70% of reads in the Vero grown stock.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Virus with Y453F shows enhanced replication and trended towards higher morbidity in ferrets</title>
<p id="P10">To investigate whether the Y453F-containing virus showed greater replication in ferrets, we intranasally inoculated 4 naive ferrets with ferret P2 virus and compared levels of virus shed from the nose to 4 ferrets previously inoculated with the same infectious titre of parental England/2/2020 virus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>(the same donors from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). At days 1-2, the mean titre of Y453F virus shed in nasal washes was significantly higher than that of the parental virus, as determined by both E gene copy number and TCID<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Both groups of ferrets showed comparable patterns of fever during infection, peaking between days 2-4, and the Y453F-infected ferrets trended towards more weight loss over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The titre of parental virus shed and fever in parental virus-infected animals approached that in the ferret P2 infected animals by days 3-4, likely because the parental virus had gained ferret-adapting mutations, such as Y453F or N501T, by this point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deep sequencing of the virus from the ferrets inoculated with the Y453F-containing ferret P2 virus showed the Y453F substitution was maintained in all 4 animals throughout the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). The E gene substitution S6L, however, was rapidly selected against, indicating that this substitution could have been an adaptation to cell culture, selected in Vero cells during isolation and amplification of the virus from nasal wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Several further substitutions, all present at very low levels in the inoculum, rapidly grew to fixation in all 4 Y453F-infected ferrets. These encoded mutations in spike at D614N, in N protein at R68P and in the NSP2 protein at T632I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). It is unclear whether these substitutions are all <italic>bona fide</italic> ferret adaptations or mutations hitchhiking as part of a selective sweep. Spike D614N may exert a similar effect to the ubiquitous SARS-CoV-2 human adaptation D614G, to non-specifically enhance ACE2 binding by promoting the spike open conformation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Overall, these data suggest that Y453F adapts the virus to ferret infection, but also further adaptations may arise during ongoing adaptation in mustelid hosts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Y453F enhances cell entry using the mustelid ACE2 receptor</title>
<p id="P11">Next, we tested whether Y453F and the other mustelid associated spike mutations improved the use of the otherwise suboptimal ferret ACE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. We created a library of spike expression constructs, generated lentivirus-based pseudoviruses and assessed the entry of these into cells transiently expressing ACE2 from human, ferret or rat, or empty vector, as previously described <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. We note that ferret ACE2 differs from that of mink by only two amino acid residues that are distal to the spike interaction interface, and therefore can be considered representative for both mustelid species (See Extended Data Figure S1).</p>
<p id="P12">While WT (D614G) spike uses ferret ACE2 poorly for entry (&gt;10-fold less well than human ACE2), the adaptations Y453F, N501T or F486L, as well as full Cluster 5 spike (Δ69/70, Y453F, D614G, I692V, M1229I), all allowed SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing pseudoviruses to enter into human- or ferret-, but not rat-, ACE2 expressing cells with much greater efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 2A</xref>). A nearby substitution, L452M, which has also appeared in at least one mink farm outbreaks <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> has no effect suggesting this is not a specific adaptation to mink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, this effect was not dependent on the presence or absence of D614G, as Y453F in a 614D background showed a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent results were also seen using a cell-cell fusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Figure 2C,D</xref>). Examining the structure of the spike RBD/ACE2 interface, each of these mink/ferret-adaptations is close to residues that differ between human and mustelid ACE2, as others have previously modelled <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. For example, Y453F lies close to H34Y (histidine in human ACE2, tyrosine in mustelid), N501T lies close to G354R, and F486L lies between ACE2 residues L79H, M82T and Q24L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Viruses containing Y453F mutation are attenuated for replication in primary human airway epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P13">To assess the impact of the Y453F mutation on the replication of virus in human airway epithelium, we infected primary human bronchial cells cultured at an air liquid interface with a mix of the parental and ferret P2 viruses at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of around 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Samples were taken 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection and analysed by deep sequencing. The WT virus significantly outcompeted Y453F, with less than <sup>~</sup>5% of reads by 48 hours post infection containing Y453F.</p>
<p id="P14">Although the Y453F containing virus is highly similar to that which circulated in mink early in the pandemic, the most prominent zoonotic spillover from mink was the Cluster 5 virus, which further contained D614G and Δ69-70. D614G and Δ69-70 are thought to potentially enhance virus infectivity in some backgrounds <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, we performed a similar competition experiment between a mixed inoculum of 40% Cluster 5 isolate and 60% early B.1 lineage, D614G containing virus (‘WT’; IC19). Again, we observed that the Y453F-containing Cluster 5 was outcompeted, constituting only <sup>~</sup>10% of reads by 24 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Finally, to further confirm that the attenuation of the Y453F containing viruses, particularly the ferret-adapted strain, wasn’t due to other changes in the genome (such as E S6L described above) we generated by reverse genetics (RG) two viruses on a Wuhan-hu-1, both carrying the D614G mutation in spike, WT (D614G), while the other additionally contained Y453F (D614G + Y453F). As with the ferret adapted P2 virus and Cluster 5 isolate we saw that the Y453F + D614G RG virus produced less infectious virus upon replication in the primary airway cells as compared to the otherwise isogenic WT (D614G) virus, significantly so at 24 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Mink adaptation has a minimal effect on SARS-CoV-2 antigenicity</title>
<p id="P16">To investigate whether a mustelid-adapted SARS-CoV-2 crossing back into the human population would have a large impact on re-infections or vaccine-breakthrough we next tested whether the mutation at Y453F facilitated escape from antibody neutralization. Surprisingly, Y453F-containing ‘Ferret P2’ virus was significantly <italic>more easily</italic> neutralised by convalescent first wave antisera than wild type requiring only 0.6 as much antisera for a 50% neutralisation titre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We further investigated the relative antigenicity of Y453F, this time using the above-described RG viruses and antisera from health care workers who had received two doses the of Pfizer-BioNtech-BNT162b2 vaccine. Again, we saw the Y453F-containing virus was more readily neutralised by 7 of the 10 vaccinee sera, although the difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">We next performed pseudovirus neutralisation assays with the previously described first wave convalescent antisera against pseudoviruses expressing the common mustelid adaptations or with full Cluster 5 spike. The B.1.351 (Beta) spike showed a significant, <sup>~</sup>5-fold drop in mean NT<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with this virus being more difficult to neutralise with first wave antisera <sup>

<title>Many circulating variants of concern show a greater ability to enter via mustelid ACE2</title>
<p id="P18">Following worldwide circulation of SARS-CoV-2, a number of ‘variant of concern’ and ‘variant of interest’ lineages have arisen associated with properties such as increased transmissibility, higher pathogenicity, and antigenic escape <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. These generally locally, or globally, outcompeted other lineages to become predominant, including the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first associated with infections the UK <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. A number of these variants have RBD mutations such as L452R, E484K and/or N501Y which are thought to promote humans ACE2 binding <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P19">To investigate whether these variants may be more able to infect mink or ferrets than the progenitor lineage B or B.1 viruses through better use of mustelid ACE2, we again used pseudoviruses expressing these variant spike proteins and normalised entry to human ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). We found that nearly all variants of concern tested could better utilise mink ACE2 than WT (D614G only) pseudovirus. B.1.1.7/E484K, Iota/B.1.526+E484K (first associated with infections in New York), Eta/B.1.525 (a variant with associations with West Africa) and L452R (in multiple variants of concern, including Epsilon/B.1.427/B.1.429, first associated with infections in California and Delta/B.1.617.2, which is currently replacing all other SARS-CoV-2 lineages globally) all allowed pseudovirus to utilise ferret ACE2 for cell entry to almost the same degree as human ACE2. Alpha/B.1.1.7 and Beta/B.1.351 spikes showed a much more modest boost while Gamma/P.1 (first found in Japan in travellers from Brazil) showed no improved usage of ferret ACE2. It appears L452R, E484K and N501Y may promote use of ferret ACE2, while K417N/T may result in a greater reduction in ferret ACE2 usage relative to human ACE2. Overall, these data suggest multiple circulating variants of concern may be able to infect mustelid hosts with only minimal, or indeed without, further adaptation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">In this study, we have performed a full risk assessment of mustelid hosts, such as mink and ferrets, as reservoirs for the emergence of antigenic variants or new variant of concern. We have shown SARS-CoV-2 is poorly adapted to mustelid ACE2 and therefore quickly gains adaptations, such as Y453F, N501T or F486L to utilise mustelid ACE2. However, Y453F in particular, negatively impacts replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, potentially explaining why the Danish mink-origin outbreaks did not propagate further following the culling of the mink. Furthermore, in line with other studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>, we found none of these mutations had a large antigenic impact, so vaccination is likely to remain effective against mustelid-adapted strains. Finally, we have shown that several VOC strains, or VOC-associated mutations, partially adapt SARS-CoV-2 spike to mustelid ACE2. Therefore, it is likely VOC lineages will continue to infect mink farms and risk spilling back over into humans.</p>
<p id="P21">Except for the Danish mink-adapted SARS-CoV-2 spillback, Y453F is found rarely in humans with very few isolates reported in GISAID and only a single report of the mutation arising in immunocompromised patients – this is despite Y453F having been shown in several studies to enhance human ACE2 binding, in a similar manner to the VOC-associated mutations N501Y or L452R <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. This would suggest that unlike the VOC-associated mutations such as N501Y, Y453F affects viral fitness in human cells. We have shown that, even in the presence of the putative stabilising NTD deletion, Δ69-70 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, virus harbouring the Y453F substitution was outcompeted by a closely related virus in human cells.</p>
<p id="P22">Here, we have demonstrated many VOCs, particularly Alpha/B.1.1.7 as well as those containing L452R (such as Delta/B.1.617.2) could have a fundamental fitness advantage in mink by increasing interaction with mustelid ACE2, compared to previous non-variant strains. At present (August 2021), the vast majority of mink-origin SARS-CoV-2 sequences on GISAID are from the year 2020, even though there are a number of ongoing mink outbreaks reported in Europe <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>, suggesting a significant reporting lag. None of the four WHO-designated variants of concern have yet been associated with mink farm outbreaks. It remains to be seen whether these VOCs would replicate in mink/ferrets without any further adaptation, but we have shown that the most common mustelid adaptations would be unlikely to have a large effect on VOC antigenicity. It will be key in the coming years to continue to closely survey farmed mink and to sequence and share any SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these animals in a timely manner as SARS-CoV-2 could still adapt in unexpected ways in mink <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P23">This work also suggests that, particularly when investigating spike RBD mutants, ferrets (or indeed mink) are poor models for humans, as mustelid ACE2 is poorly utilised by non-adapted SARS-CoV-2 spike. Thus, it is not a given that adaptation to human ACE2 will also result in increased infectiousness, transmissibility or pathogenicity in the ferret model. However, ferrets remain a useful model for investigating non-RBD phenotypes though care should be taken to use previously ferret adapted viruses to prevent rapid adaptation.</p>

Seven further sequences were excluded from further analysis as they lacked nucleotide data enabling the determination of amino acid identity at spike positions 453, 486, 501 or 614 (hCoV-19/mink/USA/MI-CDC-II1O-7265/2020, EPI_ISL_925307; hCoV-19/mink/USA/MI-CDC-IHWB-7153/2020, EPI_ISL_925308; hCoV-19/mink/USA/WI-CDC-CX2X-2436/2020, EPI_ISL_1014948; hCoV-19/mink/Netherlands/NB-EMC-3-5/2020, EPI_ISL_523094; hCoV-19/mink/Netherlands/NB-EMC-3-4/2020, EPI_ISL_523093; hCoV-19/mink/Netherlands/NB-EMC-40-4/2020, EPI_ISL_577788; hCoV-19/mink/Denmark/mDK-56/2020, EPI_ISL_641448).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the remaining 936 mink genomes rooted on the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947) with a general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution, a proportion of invariant sites estimated from the data and a gamma distribution describing among-site rate variation (GTR + <italic>I</italic> + Γ) built using RAxML v8.0.0 <sup>

<title>Passage of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets results in spontaneous emergence of the mink-associated mutations Y453F and N501T.</title>
<p>A) Ferret transmission chains from a previous study were deep sequenced to investigate any changes that occurred during infection and transmission of ferrets. Grey lines indicate previously described RNA shedding patterns seen in each ferret – pie charts indicate RBD mutations seen at each time point (as determined by deep sequencing) indicated by a black arrow.</p>
<p>B) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from American mink (<italic>Neogale vison</italic>, formerly <italic>Neovison vison</italic>), highlighting the spike mutations del69-70, Y453F, F486L or F486I, N501T, and D614G. Tip nodes are shown as points coloured by sampling location, according to the colour key. Columns to the right show the presence of either the wild-type amino acid(s) (light grey) or the mutations annotated above (coloured bars). Major epidemiological lineages designated with the Pango nomenclature system are labelled. Black arrow indicates the branch that constitutes the Danish mink strain known as cluster 5. At position 486, mutant viruses possessed 486L (leucine) except for a monophyletic clade formed of 20 sequences sampled in Latvia that possessed 486I (isoleucine) that are marked by a white asterisk.</p>
