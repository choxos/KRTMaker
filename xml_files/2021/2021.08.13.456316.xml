<abstract>
<p id="P1">The CVnCoV (CureVac) mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has recently been evaluated in a phase 2b/3 efficacy trial in humans. CV2CoV is a second-generation mRNA vaccine with optimized non-coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Here we report a head-to-head study of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in nonhuman primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 ug of lipid nanoparticle formulated CVnCoV, CV2CoV, or sham (N=6/group). CV2CoV induced substantially higher binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses, and T cell responses as compared with CVnCoV. CV2CoV also induced more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and C.37 (lambda). While CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Antibody responses correlated with protective efficacy. These data demonstrate that optimization of non-coding regions can greatly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in nonhuman primates.</p>

<p id="P2">The CVnCoV mRNA vaccine (CureVac) has recently reported efficacy results in humans in the Phase 2b/3 HERALD trial in a population that included multiple viral variants. The observed vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was approximately 48% and 53% in the overall study population and in the 18-60 years of age subgroup, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. CV2CoV is a second-generation mRNA vaccine that involves modifications of the non-coding regions that were selected based on an empiric screen for improved antigen expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Both CVnCoV and CV2CoV are based on RNActive® technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] that consists of non-chemically modified, sequence engineered mRNA, without pseudouridine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Both vaccines encode for the same full-length, pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) with identical composition. CV2CoV has been engineered with different non-coding regions flanking the open reading frame, which have previously been shown to improve transgene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Specifically, CV2CoV includes 5’ UTR HSD17B4 and 3’ UTR PSMB3 elements, followed by a histone stem loop motif and a poly-A sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; see Methods). In this study, we compare head-to-head the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in nonhuman primates.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Vaccine Immunogenicity</title>
<p id="P3">We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques intramuscularly with either 12 μg CVnCoV or CV2CoV or sham vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Animals were primed at week 0 and boosted at week 4. Sera was isolated from all animals 24h after the first vaccination to assess innate cytokine responses. CV2CoV induced higher levels of IFNα2a, IP-10 and MIP-1 compared with CVnCoV (P = 0.0152, P = 0.0152, P = 0.0411, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Binding antibody responses were assessed by receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific ELISAs at multiple timepoints following immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. At week 2, binding antibody titers were only detected with CV2CoV and not with CVnCoV (CVnCoV median titer 25 [range 25-25]; CV2CoV median titer 799 [range 82-2,010]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). One week following the week 4 boost, antibody titers increased in both groups (CVnCoV median titer 48 [range 75-710]); CV2CoV median titer 28,407 [range 2,714-86,541]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). By week 8, binding antibody titers increased in the CVnCoV group but were still &gt;50-fold lower than in the CV2CoV group (P=0.0043) (CVnCoV median titer 214 [range 47-1,238]; CV2CoV median titer 14,827 [range 2,133-37,079]).</p>
<p id="P5">Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses were assessed by pseudovirus neutralization assays initially using the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 wildtype (WT) WA1/2020 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. NAb titers followed a similar trend as binding antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). At week 2, NAb were only detected with CV2CoV and not with CVnCoV (CVnCoV median titer 20 [range 20-20]; CV2CoV median titer 131 [range 62-578]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). One week following the week 4 boost, NAb titers increased (CVnCoV median titer 55 [range 20-302]; CV2CoV median titer 2,758 [range 583-11,941]). By week 8, NAb titers increased in the CVnCoV group but were still &gt;10-fold lower than in the CV2CoV group (P=0.0043) (CVnCoV median titer 83 [range 20-335]; CV2CoV median titer 991 [range 253-2,765]).</p>
<p id="P6">At week 6, median NAb titers against the WT WA1/2020, D614G, B.1.1.7 (alpha), and B.1.351 (beta) variants were 456, 121, 101, and 189, respectively, for CVnCoV and were 12,181, 4962, 1813, and 755, respectively, for CV2CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Median NAb titers against C.37 (lamda), B.1.617.1 (kappa), and B.1.617.2 (delta) were 516, 158, and 36, respectively, for CVnCoV and were 1195, 541, and 568, respectively, for CV2CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, these data show that CV2CoV induced substantially higher NAb titers as well against SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with CVnCoV.</p>
<p id="P7">Most SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cells reside within the memory B cell pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. We assessed memory B cell responses in blood from CVnCoV, CV2CoV and sham vaccinated NHPs by flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. RBD- and Spike-specific memory B cells were detected in the CV2CoV group, but not in the CVnCoV group at week 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, 3b</xref>). The cells were not detected at week 1 for both groups (data not shown). T cell responses were assessed by IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay using pooled S peptides at week 6 in both groups but were higher in the CV2CoV group (P=0.0065) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<title>Protective Efficacy</title>
<p id="P8">All animals were challenged at week 8 with 1.0×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 via the intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) routes. Viral loads were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal swab (NS) samples collected on days 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10 following challenge by RT-PCR specific for subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. High subgenomic RNA levels were observed in BAL and NS in the sham group peak on day 2 and largely resolved by day 10. Sham controls had a peak median of 6.02 (range 4.62–6.81) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/ml in BAL and 7.35 (range 5.84–8.09) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/swab in NS on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). CVnCoV immunized animals showed a peak median of 4.92 (range 2.40–6.61) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/ml in BAL and 6.42 (range 4.46–7.81) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/swab in NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). CV2CoV immunized animals exhibited a peak median of 2.90 (range 1.70–4.64) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/ml in BAL and 3.17 (range 2.59–5.63) log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/swab in NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), with resolution of sgRNA in BAL by day 2 in most animals and by day 4 in all animals. Overall, CV2CoV resulted in significantly lower peak viral loads than CVnCoV in both BAL (P=0.0411) and NS (P=0.0087) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a and b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We next evaluated immune correlates of protection in this study. The log<sub>10</sub> ELISA and NAb titers at week 6 inversely correlated with peak log<sub>10</sub> sgRNA copies/ml in BAL (P=0.0008, R=–0.7148 and P=0.0015, R= −0.6912, respectively, two-sided Spearman rank-correlation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, c and e</xref>) and with peak sgRNA copies/nasal swab in NS (P&lt;0.0001, R=−0.8346, and P&lt;0.0001, R=−0.8766, respectively, two-sided Spearman rank-correlation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, d and f</xref>). Consistent with prior observations from our laboratory and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], these findings suggest that binding and neutralizing antibody titers are important correlates of protection for these SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in nonhuman primates. Similar correlates of protection were observed with viral loads assessed as area under the curve (AUC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Following challenge, we observed anamnestic binding and neutralizing antibody responses in the CVnCoV vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). We did not observe higher antibody responses in the CV2CoV vaccinated animals following challenge, likely reflecting the robust protection and minimal viral replication in these animals, as we have previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p>
<p id="P11">On day 10 post-challenge, animals were necropsied, and lung tissues were evaluated by histopathology. Although viral replication had largely resolved by this timepoint, sham animals had higher cumulative lung pathology scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] as compared to both CVnCoV and CV2CoV vaccinated animals (CVnCoV P= 0.0368; CV2CoV P= 0.0022) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Sham animals also had more lung lobes affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>) and more extensive lung lesions with a greater proportion of lung lobes showing evidence of interstitial inflammation, alveolar inflammatory infiltrates, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5c-h</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the cumulative lung scores between CVnCoV and CV2CoV vaccinated animals on day 10. Pathologic lesions in vaccinated animals were similar to those observed in sham animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5i-l</xref>) but fewer overall and more focal in distribution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P12">CV2CoV elicited substantially higher humoral and cellular immune responses and provided significantly improved protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared with CVnCoV in macaques. These data suggest that optimization of non-coding elements of the mRNA backbone can substantially improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Both CVnCoV and CV2CoV contain non-modified nucleotides, without pseudouridine or derivates, and CV2CoV has previously been shown to lead to higher antigen expression than CVnCoV in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. While previous studies in rodents and nonhuman primates have demonstrated protection by CVnCoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] this was only studied in the lower respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. In the present study, CVnCoV provided only modest reductions in viral loads in BAL and NS compared with sham controls. In contrast, CV2CoV induced &gt;10-fold higher NAb responses than CVnCoV against multiple viral variants and provided &gt;3 log reductions in sgRNA copies/ml in BAL and &gt;4 log reductions in sgRNA copies/swab in NS compared with sham controls.</p>
<p id="P13">Previous mRNA vaccine clinical trials have demonstrated onset of protective efficacy after the first dose and improved protection after the boost immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In the present study, the prime immunization with CV2CoV induced binding and neutralizing antibodies in all macaques by week 2, and these responses increased substantially by 1 week after the boost immunization. Although comparisons with other nonhuman primate studies are difficult due to differences in study designs and laboratory assays, NAb titers induced by CV2CoV appear roughly similar to those reported for previous mRNA vaccines in macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p>
<p id="P14">As previously reported for other vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], NAb titers were lower to certain SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta), than to the parental strain WA1/2020. Although our challenge virus in this study was SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, NAb titers elicited by CV2CoV to these viral variants exceeded the threshold that we previously reported as threshold titers for protection (50-100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, future studies will be required to assess directly the protective efficacy of CV2CoV against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in non-human primates.</p>
<p id="P15">CV2CoV induced both antigen-specific memory B cell responses and T cell responses. While the correlates of protection in this study were binding and neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], it is likely that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to viral clearance in tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. We previously reported that depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells partially abrogated protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge in convalescent macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Memory B cells may contribute to durability of antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], although B cell germinal center responses and durability of protective efficacy following CV2CoV vaccination remain to be determined. Moreover, although this study was not specifically designed as a safety study, it is worth noting that we did not observe any adverse effects following CVnCoV or CV2CoV vaccination, and we did not observe any unexpected or enhanced pathology in the vaccinated animals at necropsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p>
<p id="P16">In summary, our data show that optimization of non-coding regions in a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine can substantially improve its immunogenicity against multiple viral variants and enhance protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in nonhuman primates. Improved characteristics of CV2CoV, compared with CVnCoV, could translate into increased efficacy in humans, and clinical trials of CV2CoV are planned.</p>

<title>mRNA vaccines</title>
<p id="P17">The two mRNA vaccines, CVnCoV and CV2CoV, are based on CureVac’s RNActive<sup>®</sup> platform (claimed and described in e.g. WO2002098443 and WO2012019780) and do not include chemically modified nucleosides. They are comprised of a 5′ cap1 structure, a GC-enriched open reading frame (ORF), 3′ UTR and a vector-encoded poly-A stretch. CVnCoV contains a cleanCap (Trilink), parts of the 3′ UTR of the Homo sapiens alpha haemoglobin gene as 3′ UTR, followed by a poly-A (64) stretch, a polyC (30) stretch and a histone stem loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. CV2CoV has previously been described to contain a cleanCap followed by 5′ UTR from the human hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4 gene (HSD17B4) and a 3′ UTR from human proteasome 20S subunit beta 3 gene (PSMB3), followed by a histone stem loop and a poly-A (100) stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Both constructs were encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) by Acuitas Therapeutics (Vancouver, Canada) (CV2CoV) or Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH (Klosterneuburg, Austria) (CVnCoV). LNPs are composed of ionizable amino lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and a PEGylated lipid; compositions for CVnCoV and CV2CoV are identical. Both mRNAs encode for SARS-CoV-2 full length spike protein containing stabilizing K986P and V987P mutations (NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512.2).</p>

<title>Animals and study design</title>
<p id="P18">18 cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned to three groups. Animals received either CVnCoV (N=6) or CV2CoV (N=6) mRNA vaccines or were designated as sham controls (N=6). The mRNA vaccines were administered at a 12 μg dose, intramuscularly, in the left quadriceps on day 0. Boost immunizations were similarly administered at week 4. At week 8, all animals were challenged with 1.0x10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2 derived from USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281; BEI Resources) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Challenge virus was administered as 1 ml by the intranasal (IN) route (0.5 ml in each nare) and 1 ml by the intratracheal (IT) route. All animals were sacrificed 10 days post challenge. Immunologic and virologic assays were performed blinded. All animals were housed at Bioqual, Inc. (Rockville, MD). All animal studies were conducted in compliance with all relevant local, state, and federal regulations and were approved by the Bioqual Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p>

<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p id="P20">RBD-specific binding antibodies were assessed by ELISA as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 1μg/ml SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (40592-VNAH, SinoBiological) in 1X DPBS and incubated at 4°C overnight. After incubation, plates were washed once with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in 1 X DPBS) and blocked with 350 μL Casein block/well for 2–3 h at room temperature. After incubation, block solution was discarded, and plates were blotted dry. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum diluted in casein block were added to wells and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed three times and incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-macaque IgG HRP (NIH NHP Reagent Program) at room temperature in the dark. Plates were then washed three more times, and 100 μL of SeraCare KPL TMB SureBlue Start solution was added to each well; plate development was halted by the addition of 100 μL SeraCare KPL TMB Stop solution per well. The absorbance at 450nm was recorded using a VersaMax or Omega microplate reader. ELISA endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance &gt; 0.2. Log10 endpoint titers are reported. Immunologic assays were performed blinded.</p>

<title>Pseudovirus neutralization assay</title>
<p id="P21">The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses expressing a luciferase reporter gene were generated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Briefly, the packaging plasmid psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program), luciferase reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), and Spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS CoV-2 SΔCT of variants were co-transfected into HEK293T cells by lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). Pseudoviruses of SARS-CoV-2 variants were generated by using WA1/2020 strain (Wuhan/WIV04/2019, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402124), D614G mutation, B.1.1.7 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_601443), B.1.351 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_712096), C37 variant (GenBank ID: QRX62290), B.1.671.1 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_1384866) and B.1.617.2 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_2020950). The supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were collected 48 h post-transfection, which were purified by centrifugation and filtration with 0.45 μm filter. To determine the neutralization activity of the plasma or serum samples from participants, HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.75 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of heat inactivated serum or plasma samples were prepared and mixed with 50 μL of pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 h before adding to HEK293T-hACE2 cells. 48 h after infection, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in relative light unit (RLU) was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.</p>

<title>IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay</title>
<p id="P23">ELISPOT plates were coated with mouse anti-human IFN-γ monoclonal antibody from BD Pharmingen at a concentration of 5 μg/well overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed with DPBS containing 0.25% Tween 20, and blocked with R10 media (RPMI with 11% FBS and 1.1% penicillin-streptomycin) for 1 h at 37°C. The Spike 1 and Spike 2 peptide pools (JPT Peptide Technologies, custom made) used in the assay contain 15 amino acid peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids that span the protein sequence and reflect the N- and C- terminal halves of the protein, respectively. Spike 1 and Spike 2 peptide pools were prepared at a concentration of 2 μg/well, and 200,000 cells/well were added. The peptides and cells were incubated for 18–24 h at 37°C. All steps following this incubation were performed at room temperature. The plates were washed with ELISPOT wash buffer and incubated for 2 h with Rabbit polyclonal anti-human IFN-γ Biotin from U-Cytech (1 μg/mL). The plates are washed a second time and incubated for 2 h with Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase antibody from Southern Biotechnology (1 μg/mL). The final wash was followed by the addition of Nitro-blue Tetrazolium Chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro 3 ‘indolyl phosphate p-toludine salt (NBT/BCIP chromagen) substrate solution (Thermo Scientific) for 7 min. The chromagen was discarded and the plates were washed with water and dried in a dim place for 24 h. Plates were scanned and counted on a Cellular Technologies Limited Immunospot Analyzer.</p>

A standard was generated by first synthesizing a gene fragment of the subgenomic E gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The gene fragment was subsequently cloned into a pcDNA3.1+ expression plasmid using restriction site cloning (Integrated DNA Technologies). The insert was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed to RNA using the AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (CellScript). Log dilutions of the standard were prepared for RT-PCR assays ranging from 1x10<sup>10</sup> copies to 1x10<sup>-1</sup> copies. Viral loads were quantified from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swabs (NS). RNA extraction was performed on a QIAcube HT using the IndiSpin QIAcube HT Pathogen Kit according to manufacturer’s specifications (Qiagen). The standard dilutions and extracted RNA samples were reverse transcribed using SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) following the cycling conditions described by the manufacturer. A Taqman custom gene expression assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was designed using the sequences targeting the E gene sgRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The sequences for the custom assay were as follows, forward primer, sgLeadCoV2.Fwd: CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC, E_Sarbeco_R: ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA, E_Sarbeco_P1 (probe): VIC-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-MGBNFQ. Reactions were carried out in duplicate for samples and standards on the QuantStudio 6 and 7 Flex Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) with the thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds, then 45 cycles of 95°C for 1 second and 60°C for 20 seconds. Standard curves were used to calculate subgenomic RNA copies per ml or per swab. The quantitative assay sensitivity was determined as 50 copies per ml or per swab.</p>
