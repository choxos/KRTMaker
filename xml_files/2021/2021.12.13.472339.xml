These drivers can cause changes in the abundance of taxa, the composition of communities, and the properties of ecosystems. While the influence of single drivers is already described in numerous studies, the effect and predictability of multiple drivers changing simultaneously is still poorly understood. In this study, we used 240 highly replicable oxic/anoxic aquatic lab microcosms and four drivers (fertilizer, glyphosate, metal pollution, antibiotics) in all possible combinations at three different temperatures (20 °C, 24 °C, and 28 °C) to shed light into consequences of multiple drivers on different levels of organization, ranging from species abundance to community and ecosystem parameters. We found (i) that at all levels of ecological organisation, combinations of drivers can change the biological consequence and direction of effect compared to single drivers (ii), that effects of combinations are further modified by temperature, (iii) that a larger number of drivers occurring simultaneously is often quite closely related to their effect size, and (iv) that there is little evidence that any of these effects are associated with the level of ecological organisation of the state variable. These findings suggest that, at least in this experimental ecosystem approximating a stratified aquatic ecosystem, there may be relatively little scope for predicting the effects of combinations of drivers from the effects of individual drivers, or by accounting for the level of ecological organisation in question, though there may be some scope for prediction based on the number of drivers that are occurring simultaneous. A priority, though also a considerable challenge, is to extend such research to consider continuous variation in the magnitude of multiple drivers acting together.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Microbial communities are key components of many ecosystems, and are often exposed to many anthropogenic global change drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Christensen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Jackson et al. 2016</xref>). Exposure to fertilizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">da Costa et al. 2021</xref>) and metal pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Xu et al. 2018a</xref>), pesticides like glyphosate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Solomon and Thompson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Relyea 2009</xref>), antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Xu et al. 2018b</xref>) and temperature increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wu et al. 2011</xref>) force populations and whole ecosystems to develop in different ways compared to less or unaffected ones (Tylianakis et al. 2008). Studies show that even slight changes in environmental conditions can lead to large taxonomic and functional microbial change, and even to regime shifts, with potential long-term consequences for biogeochemical cycles and ecological function of the affected habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gruber 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P3">While many studies have focused on one global change driver, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Christensen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Rillig et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Suleiman et al. 2021a</xref>) indicated that the combined effect of multiple drivers applied simultaneously is often not equal to the sum of the effects of each individual driver. Rather, they demonstrate that interactive effects can occur. These can be synergistic (combined effect greater than the sum of the effect of individual drivers) or antagonistic (combined effect less than the sum of the effect of individual drivers). Furthermore, not just the type of driver, but also the number of factors combined plays a crucial role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Rillig et al. 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the number of studies testing three or more drivers remains very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Rillig et al. 2019</xref>), which highlights the need for further investigations of combined effects. Combining this with the importance of understanding drivers of change in microbial communities is a critical aspect of the emerging research field of climate/global change microbiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hutchins et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The limited number of studies with three or more drivers may be in part due to the logistical demands of the required experiments and the complexity of interpreting their results. For example, to assess all interactions a fully-factorial experimental design is needed which quickly leads to large experiments. Regarding interpretation, it can be difficult to understand the meaning of interactions among more than three drivers, such that even if one would conduct a fully factorial experiment, traditional methods for interpreting interactions (such as interaction plots) may be insufficient. Some studies have instead focused on the effect of variation in the number of drivers, and have applied only a subsample of all possible combinations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Brennan and Collins 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Rillig et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Another gap in understanding is how drivers and combinations of drivers act across levels of ecological organization from individuals to ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Galic et al. 2018</xref>). For example, in a case study of a model of amphipod feeding behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Galic et al (2018)</xref> showed that responses to multiple drivers at the individual level were not consistent with those at higher levels of organization. In their case-study, the nature of this inconsistency would lead to underestimation of effects at population and ecosystem levels if effects at the individual level were assumed to hold across levels of organisation.</p><p id="P6">These gaps in knowledge are problematic. One reason is that interactions can be source of ecological surprises, i.e., if we assume additivity we can be surprised if there are interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Christensen et al 2006</xref>). Also, unless there are some generalities about interactions among drivers, we will never be able to predict the effect of a new (previously unstudied) combination of drivers, so interactions will also then be a surprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Christensen et al 2006</xref>). Hence, we and others (e.g., Simmons et al 2021, Rillig et al 2018) are interested in discovering if there are any general patterns that will allow us to predict the effects of combinations of environmental changes. This report is about our search for signals of general patterns in the effects of combinations of environmental drivers. For example, whether the relationship between a biological variable and the number of drivers is dependent on the level of ecological organization of the biological variable and whether the strength and nature of the interaction effects varies with level of ecological organization.</p><p id="P7">Microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems are complex (Chistensen et al. 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davis et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Faust and Raes 2012</xref>), consisting of feedback among numerous abiotic and biotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Singh et al. 2009</xref>), among and within functional microbial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bush et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Richardson et al. 2018</xref>).

Our experiment includes the analysis of several abiotic (oxygen, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, pH) and biotic variables (Shannon index, microbial community composition, genera abundances), since recent studies have shown that various levels of ecosystems can be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Weithoff et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Shade et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Suleiman et al. 2021b</xref>) and in order to examine if effects show predictable variation across levels of organisation. We hypothesize that (i) combinations of drivers will have non-additive effects on system properties, (ii) the non-additive effects will be different depending on the temperature, and (iii) increasing the number of drivers applied will cause a systematic change in system properties.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials and methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental ecosystems</title><p id="P9">Incubation of stratified microbial communities was performed in microcosms consisting of standard glass test tubes (4 mL volume).

Please note that for clarity we also refer to NMDS scores with “negative” and “positive”, even though the direction is irrelevant for this measure. The three-way interaction of fertilizer+antibiotics+temperature on NMDS1 score is a good example how combination of drivers can change the impact direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>): When no fertilizer was present, the NMDS1 score was negative, while in presence of fertilizer, the NMDS1 score was positive. Additionally the combination of antibiotics and temperature changed the magnitude of the NMDS1 score. NMDS1 score was affected by number of drivers (F-statistic = 82.8, p-value &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), and NMDS2 score was affected by both number of drivers (F-statistic = 12.7, p-value &lt; 0.001) and temperature (F-statistic = 27.8, p-value &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

Furthermore, number of drivers strongly affected the total nitrogen concentration (F-statistic = 67.8, p-value &lt; 0.001).

Specifically, the addition of a driver, and/or temperature increase, could change the biological consequences of already applied drivers, even when the added driver applied alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We observed three trends here. The addition of a further driver could increase (e.g. F:A:T28), decrease (e.g. F:T28) or reverse the effect of the drivers which were already applied (e.g. F:A on <italic>Tychonema</italic> abundance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This demonstrates clearly the need of analysing multiple drivers in all combinations. Furthermore, our study also confirmed that the number of drivers occurring together can influence microbial communities and thereby provide some hope that number of drivers can be used as a useful predictor, though individual driver effects can greatly contribute to the effect of number of drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Rillig et al. 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of the number of drivers can be negative (e.g., <italic>Tychonema</italic> abundance) or positive (e.g. total nitrogen) and of different magnitudes, which highlights again the need of analysing various ecological response variables of species, microbial communities, and the whole ecosystem. While there may be some patterns across levels of organisation, e.g., the largest effects of number of drivers were observed at species and community levels of organisation (greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5 standardised effect size), the absence of strong patterns limits the scope for explanation and prediction of effect of multiple drivers across levels of organisation.</p><p id="P33">It is possible that effects of number of drivers is caused by multiple drivers acting in a similar fashion as a single driver of greater intensity. I.e. two drivers may be considered to typically have a higher effect because the overall intensity is higher. This would imply that drivers combine additively, or at least not completely substitutively. If this is the case, then some of the effects of number of drivers may not be so much number of drivers per se, but rather that total amount of driving being applied. Given that responses can be non-linear (and typically are), we can not exclude that some trends observed may simply be intensity effects.</p><p id="P34">A clear pattern in the results is of less apparent variability at 0 and at 4 drivers applied than with 1, 2, or 3 applied. This mainly because there are fewer combinations possible (1 combination possible to be precise: all or none), while at 1 to 3 drivers there are more combination of drivers possible, which leads to more variance. In contrast variance within driver combination is roughly invariant regardless of number of drivers. We are certain if we had a 5th stressor applied, we would see much more variation at 4 stressors applied, again because then we would have (5 choose 4)=5 possible stressor combinations.</p><p id="P35">While fertilizer, metal pollution and antibiotics had detectable effects when applied as single drivers, glyphosate did not. This finding is likely quite specific to the concentration of treatments used and should be regarded with caution. Nevertheless, it is even more interesting that when adding glyphosate to other drivers it did have an effect (see e.g., Shannon index, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Strong interactions were detected for antibiotics and fertilizer, and interestingly, these drivers revealed in combination different biological consequences compared to applied as a single driver, and temperature could also change the effects of the fertilizer-antibiotic driver duo again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P36">The effect of temperature is in our view important to note, since it predicts that observed biological consequences caused by global change can change with on-going global warming. An increase of temperature can lead to new interactions among driver combinations (F:A with increasing temperature led again to significant affected variables) or can lead to significant effects that were not observed at 20 °C (G:M, G:M:24 and G:M:28 for NMDS1).</p><p id="P37">Our study also contributes to narrowing the gap of understanding of how drivers and their combination act across various levels of organisation. Our results revealed that individual taxa can be affected differently compared to abiotic factors of the ecosystem or the microbial community composition. Therefore, our study is in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Galic et al. (2018)</xref> who reported differences of the influence of multiple drivers across levels of organisation. Interestingly, in our study, some treatment combinations, like fertilizer and antibiotics, showed significant influence across most variables and the three levels of organisation (except total nitrogen and total carbon), though even then the sign of the interaction term was sometimes negative and sometimes positive.</p><p id="P38">Effects of drivers, such as those we manipulated, are of course concentration-dependent. In this study, we used only two levels of driver concentration and added the driver in a single pulse treatment. More information about specific concentration thresholds and press disturbances are important to study and may clarify some observed trends, as well as the timing of the driver applied. In addition, responses of functional (metabolic) aspects of the aquatic microbial communities should be investigated in future studies, which could shed light into activated and deactivated pathways and enzymes used in microbial communities to react to changing environmental conditions.</p><p id="P39">One limitation of this study is that the background level of chemical stressor was not analysed prior to stressor addition. This information is important, since prior exposure to pollution would influent the responses to additional exposures. We expect that the small pond which was used to provide the water and sediment sample is low-nutrient loaded, and is due to its location largely free from herbicide, metal-, and antibiotic contamination. Nevertheless, this study showed clearly that combinations of stressors can lead to a new biological consequence, and this finding is very likely not impacted by any pre-exposure of drivers of the small pond.</p><p id="P40">One promising avenue for further research about species responses to multiple environmental drivers is to attempt to relate the patterns of response to features of the species, such as functional traits of the species. A relationship would reveal what traits of the species are determining how they respond to multiple drivers, and then give potential to predict those responses from species traits. This could be done for already present species, and also potentially invasive species. In studies such as ours, this would involve relating response patterns to characteristics of the microbial ASVs, and hence would require mapping of ASVs to trait information, which is not straightforward. Another option would be to use the 16S rRNA gene sequences to predict functional characteristics of the ASVs (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ling et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P41">In sum, our study confirmed the need to research the effects of multiple drivers on microbial communities and indicates further that a broad range of levels of organisation (species, community, ecosystem) should be analysed due to unique sets of effect and interactions across these and the different variables within them. Furthermore, our study showed that combination of specific drivers can change the biological consequence and direction compared to single drivers at all levels of organisation and that the effects of driver combinations can be modified by temperature. Overall, the lack of patterns in effect sizes across levels of organisation, and with respect to the number of drivers, represents lack of evidence for these to be useful in the prediction of the effects of combinations of global change drivers on ecological communities.</p><p id="P42">Finally, it is unclear how transferable our findings are to non-microbes or even to other types of microbial ecosystems. Microbes have some unique characteristics, such as mechanisms by which genetic material can move among individuals (horizontal gene transfer). There may be other important differences, such as strong interspecific interactions, particularly in closed experimental communities. Clearly what is required is a sufficient number of experiments, across a diverse enough collection of ecosystem and organism types, that involve at least four environmental drivers and observation of responses at population, community and ecosystem level, such that a formal meta-analysis is possible. This could be achieved a global network of such multi-stressor factorial experiments studying responses across levels of ecological organization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS144973-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAeEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MS was funded by Forschungskredit of the UZH (FK-20-125).
