Rhythms are present in red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant cell type in the body, but their physiological function is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel biochemical assay for haemoglobin (Hb) oxidation status which relies on a redox-sensitive covalent haem-Hb linkage that forms during SDS-mediated cell lysis. Formation of this linkage is lowest when ferrous Hb is oxidised, in the form of ferric metHb. Daily haemoglobin oxidation rhythms are observed in RBCs cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> or taken from freely behaving mice or humans exhibit and are unaffected by mutations that affect circadian rhythms in nucleated cells. These rhythms correlate with daily rhythms in core body temperature, with temperature lowest when metHb levels are highest. Raising metHb levels with dietary sodium nitrite can further decrease daytime core body temperature in mice via NO signaling. These results extend our molecular understanding of RBC circadian rhythms and suggest they contribute to the regulation of body temperature.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Body temperature</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>erythrocyte</kwd><kwd>haemoglobin</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology are observed in all kingdoms of life and are of fundamental importance for understanding human health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Patke <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In mammals, the daily organisation of cellular homeostasis occurs through the interaction between cell-intrinsic timing mechanisms with daily systemic cues; giving rise to rhythms in protein activity, electrical excitability, and cell motility, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Stangherlin <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Cell-autonomous circadian timing can be affected by mutations in a number of proteins including kinases (e.g. CK1, CK2 and GSK3), transcription factors (e.g. CLOCK and BMAL1), and repressors such as PER and CRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ko &amp; Takahashi, 2006</xref>). In most cell types, whilst the identity of ‘clock-controlled genes’ varies with tissue context, the rhythmic regulation of clock-controlled transcription is proposed to be the central cell-intrinsic mechanism by which cellular biology and function manifests as a daily rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Ruben <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Circadian oscillations in cellular biology exist in the naturally anucleate red blood cell (RBC), however, and so cannot be attributable to rhythms in nascent transcription. Circadian regulation of metabolism, redox balance, proteasomal degradation, and membrane electrophysiology have all been observed in isolated RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ch <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Henslee <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Homma <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cho <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The period of these circadian rhythms is sensitive to inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the activity of casein kinase 1, as in nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beale <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cho <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the absence of transcription or translation, RBC circadian rhythms are hypothesised to reflect a post-translational oscillator (PTO) that involves CK1, a ubiquitous component of circadian rhythms across the eukaryotic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">O’Neill <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Causton <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). RBCs may therefore serve as a tractable model for interrogation of the putative PTO mechanism and post-translational rhythmic regulation of cellular processes more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wong &amp; O’Neill, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Observations of circadian rhythms in RBCs raise two important questions. First, since anucleate RBCs derive from nucleated precursors during erythropoiesis, do TTFL-regulated rhythms in erythroid progenitors influence timekeeping in isolated RBCs once they are terminally differentiated and anucleate? Second, in what way might circadian rhythms in RBCs impact upon critical physiological functions, such as gas transportation? Here, we address these questions in three ways: (1) characterising a novel rhythmic process in RBCs to aid investigation of RBC circadian mechanisms; (2) using this tool to describe oscillations in RBCs derived from mice harbouring well-characterised circadian mutations and free-living human subjects; and (3) by pharmacological manipulation of rhythms to assess functional relevance. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel biomarker for circadian phase <italic>in vivo</italic> that may be relevant for understanding daily variation in oxygen delivery, peripheral blood flow, and body temperature.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An additional circadian marker in RBCs</title><p id="P5">Circadian rhythms of NAD(P)H concentration, PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub> abundance and membrane physiology are observed in isolated mammalian red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cho <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Henslee <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). While investigating PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub> rhythms in isolated human red blood cells, we noticed faint chemiluminescent bands at ˜16 kDa and ˜32 kDa which exhibited more robust circadian rhythmicity than PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). This uncharacterised, rhythmic chemiluminescence was readily observed upon incubating membranes with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent immediately after transfer from polyacrylamide gel, without any antibody incubations or exogenous source of peroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Expanded View figure 1A</xref>). Recognising the utility of an additional marker for RBC circadian rhythms, we sought to characterise the source of this chemiluminescence.</p><p id="P6">The presence of chemiluminescence in the absence of antibody suggested that some RBC protein species possess an intrinsic peroxidase activity that is tolerant to the denaturing buffer (containing 1% dodecyl sulphate pH 8.5) used for cell lysis. The ECL peroxidase reaction employed in modern immunoblotting is usually catalysed by horseradish peroxidase but can, in fact, be catalysed by any haem group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Das &amp; Hecht, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Keilin &amp; Hartree, 1950</xref>). At high concentrations, sodium azide (NaN3) inactivates peroxidase activity of haem groups through azidyl radical addition to the prosthetic group, and is a common means of inactivating peroxidase activity in immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Montellano <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). To confirm that this SDS-resistant species indeed catalyses the ECL reaction through an intrinsic peroxidase activity, we incubated freshly transferred membranes with 30 mM (0.2%) NaN3 for 30 minutes prior to assaying peroxidase activity <italic>via</italic> ECL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Pre-treatment with azide elicited a marked reduction in chemiluminescence, indicating that a haem-mediated (non-HRP) peroxidase activity was indeed adsorbed to the nitrocellulose membrane following transfer after SDS-PAGE. Haemoglobin (Hb, MW 16 kDa) is the most common haem protein in RBCs, comprising 97% of all RBC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pesciotta <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Roux-Dalvai <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) with a small minority of Hb monomers being observed to run as a cross-linked dimer (Hb<sub>2</sub>, ˜32 kDa) by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fuhrmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). We therefore considered it plausible that the rhythmic non-specific peroxidase activity might be attributable to a covalent haem-Hb moiety: a linkage that would be intrinsically resistant to denaturation <italic>via</italic> SDS and subsequent polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In RBCs under physiological conditions, however, Fe-haem is well characterised as being bound to Hb protein through non-covalent co-ordination by proximal and distal histidine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Perutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1960</xref>). Therefore, it should not be resistant to denaturation by SDS. Importantly, however, covalent linkage of haem to haem-binding proteins, including globins, has been reported to occur under several non-physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Catalano <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Deterding <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Enggist <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Reeder <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reeder, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To assess whether some fraction of Fe-haem is covalently bound to Hb protein, we employed Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under native and denaturing conditions. Under native conditions, haem proteins are readily bound by Ni-NTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pesciotta <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Under denaturing conditions, we reasoned that only proteins that are covalently linked to haem should show high affinity for the Ni-NTA matrix. Commensurately, we found that the non-specific peroxidase bound to, and eluted from, Ni-NTA under both native and denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mass spectrometry of the eluted 16 kDa protein revealed the major species to be haemoglobin beta and alpha (≥ 95% coverage) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Expanded View figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, mass spectrometry of full length HbA, purified under denaturing conditions, revealed additional peaks at +614 Da compared with the HbA polypeptide, which corresponds to the mass of deprotonated haem b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Expanded View figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the SDS-resistant peroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) was assigned to haemoglobin.</p><p id="P9">We considered that the unsaturated bonds in the haem porphyrin ring should be an attractive target for Click chemistry through base-catalysed Michael addition from a cysteinyl thiol under the denaturing and basic RBC lysis conditions we employ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nair <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). This reaction would be expected to produce a thioester-linked adduct of Fe-haem to Hb protein, though likely with a poor yield since this reaction would be competing with mixed disulphide bond formation under these lysis conditions. To test this, we included high concentrations of strong reductants (DTT and NH<sub>3</sub>OH) in the lysis buffer, which reduce thioester (but not thioether) bonds under aqueous conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pedone <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). We found that the residual peroxidase activity of Hb on nitrocellulose membranes was completely abolished under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), supporting a thioester linkage. To validate this, we pre-incubated RBCs with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to alkylate Hb cysteine residues prior to lysis - effectively blocking <italic>de novo</italic> thioester bond formation without affecting any thioester bonds that might exist prior to lysis. NEM pre-treatment abolished subsequent peroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating that thioester bond formation is facilitated by protein denaturation during cell lysis.</p><p id="P10">Overall, our observations accord with a model whereby the rhythmic peroxidase activity we detect arises from a small proportion of Hb becoming thioester-linked to haem during cell lysis, but does not explain why the formation of this bond might exhibit a circadian rhythm. The total amount of Hb detected by coomassie was invariant throughout the RBC circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Expanded View figures 1</xref>, 3); whereas the peroxidase activity associated with Hb (and Hb<sub>2</sub>) showed a clear circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Expanded View figures 1</xref>, 3). Moreover, the proportion of Hb protein that was covalently linked to haem-Hb was very low compared with the total amount of RBC Hb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previous work has indicated that RBCs exhibit a circadian rhythm in the oxidation of certain protein species including the oxidation and over-oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins, the latter being degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cho <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), as well as rhythms in Hb-quaternary structure and the cellular reducing equivalents (NAD(P)H), that are normally used by methaemoglobin (metHb) reductase to reduce metHb back to the ground state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). These are suggestive of a circadian rhythm in the oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin to form ferric (inactive, deoxy, Fe(III)) metHb, and subsequent H2O2 formation, which possibly results as a consequence of daily variation in Hb dimer-tetramer equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In light of these observations, and the strong evidence for dynamic regulation of Hb redox state in RBCs under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Umbreit, 2007</xref>), we asked whether the redox state of haem-Hb at the point of cell lysis might affect the level of thioester bond formation. Deoxygenated ferrous (Fe(II)) Hb is readily susceptible to oxidation to ferric (Fe(III)) metHb by nitrite at low millimolar concentrations that will not oxidise cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cortese-Krott <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Conversely, millimolar ascorbate reduces metHb back to the ferrous state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Eder <italic>et al</italic>, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gibson, 1943</xref>), whereas similar concentrations of azide, a less favourable electron donor or acceptor, should have less effect on Hb redox state under these conditions. Acute treatments of intact RBCs prior to lysis with sodium nitrite and sodium ascorbate dose-dependently decreased and increased, respectively, the peroxidase activity detected at Hb molecular weight on nitrocellulose membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), compared with a much more modest effect of sodium azide. An in-gel colourimetric haem stain yielded similar results to the ECL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Taken together, our observations support a model whereby a small proportion of ferrous haem spontaneously crosslinks with Hb via a thioester bond upon cell lysis which is stable during subsequent SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. This proportion is influenced by the redox state of haem-Hb in the RBCs prior to lysis and hence lysis-induced crosslinking reveals the underlying redox status of Hb. The Hb-based marker demonstrated here, allowing detection of RBC circadian rhythms by ECL reagent alone, represents a novel report for RBC circadian rhythms, a second facet of the redox rhythm in RBCs. We coin this technique “Bloody Blotting”, distinguishable from immunoblotting by the lack of any antibodies, blocking step or exogenous source of peroxidase activity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Clock mutations do not affect RBC circadian rhythms</title><p id="P13">Oscillations in cellular processes in RBCs cannot be attributable to transcriptional repression by PER and CRY proteins since these proteins are not present in RBCs, nor do RBCs possess the capacity for transcriptional feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bryk &amp; Wiśniewski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, circadian rhythms in mature isolated RBCs are also insensitive to inhibition of nascent transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). However, the RBC develops from nucleated precursors, the normoblasts, during erythropoiesis and we therefore considered whether the developmental expression of circadian cycles in erythroid precursors might affect circadian phenotype of mature RBCs. To address this possibility, we isolated RBCs from mice harbouring well-characterised circadian mutations of the post-translational regulators of PER and CRY, CK1<italic>ε<sup>Tau/Tau</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lowrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Meng <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) and FBXL3<italic><sup>Afterhours/Afterhours</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Godinho <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) respectively, and examined circadian rhythms under constant conditions using PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub> abundance and Bloody Blotting as rhythmic reporters.</p><p id="P14">Mice homozygous for these mutations exhibit behavioural circadian periods that are shorter (<italic>tau</italic> mutant) and longer (<italic>afterhours</italic>, <italic>afh</italic> mutant) than wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Godinho <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lowrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Meng <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Since circadian timekeeping occurs cell-autonomously, the short and long period phenotypes observed at the whole organism level are readily recapitulated in fibroblasts isolated from homozygous mutant <italic>Cry1:luciferase</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fibroblasts harbouring <italic>tau</italic> or <italic>afh</italic> mutations exhibit circadian periods 2.4 h shorter and 6.7 h longer, respectively, than wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, unlike fibroblasts, no significant difference in circadian period was seen between the three mouse genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, the altered timing observed in mutants of nucleated cells is not inherited by RBCs and the timekeeping role of CK1 in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beale <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) is within a PTO that does not involve PER, CRY, CK1<italic>ε</italic> or FBXL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bryk &amp; Wiśniewski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">O’Neill &amp; Reddy, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the similar circadian period between these reporters of redox state, irrespective of genotype origin, indicates they are two outputs of the same underlying oscillation, but with a higher relative amplitude and earlier phase in the Hb<sub>2</sub>* bands compared with PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Daily variation in redox status in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>

<italic>In vivo</italic>, haem-Hb occurs in human RBCs in two oxidation states: as ferrous Hb(II) and as ferric metHb(III). The transport of oxygen requires oxygen reversibly bound to ferrous Hb(II). Oxygenated tetrameric Hb(Fe(II))O<sub>2</sub> is a very stable complex but does slowly auto-oxidize at a rate of about 3-4 %/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Eder <italic>et al</italic>, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) a rate that is accelerated at lower partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> (pO<sub>2</sub>) when the haemoglobin is partially oxygenated. In a healthy individual, metHb reductase ensures that &lt; 1 % of RBC Hb exists in the Fe(III) state, although disease, dietary nitrites and inherited conditions such as methaemoglobinemia can elevate this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cawein <italic>et al</italic>, 1964</xref>).

We therefore collected and flash froze blood samples every 2 hours from 4 healthy volunteers, beginning at habitual wake time, over a complete circadian cycle under controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Despite the differences in entrainment (<italic>ex vivo</italic> vs <italic>in vivo</italic>), PRX-SO<sub>2/3</sub> immunoreactivity in isolated RBCs consistently peaked at a point equivalent to the middle to end of the active phase <italic>in vivo</italic> (at the transition from hot to cold).

Nevertheless, daily regulation of Hb redox status has functional significance in at least two ways. Since metHb cannot bind O<sub>2</sub>, metHb rhythms may affect the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. We found a daily rhythm of modest relative amplitude in SpO<sub>2</sub> in antiphase with metHb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Though this is correlational, the phase relationship between the rhythm in metHb and SpO<sub>2</sub> is consistent with the influence of metHb on Hb’s allosteric Hill co-efficient. MetHb stabilises the R state of Hb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gladwin &amp; Kim-Shapiro, 2008</xref>) meaning that when metHb is higher, transition to the Hb T-state will occur at relatively lower pO<sub>2</sub> and thereby facilitate increased oxygen supply to peripheral blood vessels/tissues during the rest phase. However, the low amplitude is likely to limit its the physiological significance for oxygen-carrying capacity.</p><p id="P25">A more important potential consequence of daily cycles of Hb redox status is the regulation of vascular tone and peripheral blood flow through nitric oxide (NO) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">DeMartino <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Grubina <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Umbreit, 2007</xref>).

Co-oximetry records pulse rate (PR), perfusion index (PI, the ratio of the pulsatile blood flow to the nonpulsatile static blood flow in a peripheral tissue), and the proportion of total Hb (SpHb), Oxygenated Hb (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and MetHb (SpMet) in the blood. Four freely-behaving, healthy, age-matched male volunteers (25-35 years old) were monitored over a 3-day period during a normal working week.</p><p id="P39">Data was collected in Cambridge, UK between September and November, 2012. Data collection was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval/favourable opinion from the Local Research Ethics Committee (University of Cambridge, UK). Participants in the study were screened for relevant self-reported health issues, including sleep disorders or excessive daytime sleepiness.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Mouse body temperature measurement</title><p id="P40">Animal experiments were approved by the animal welfare committee at the University of Manchester. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River (UK). N=8 mice were housed under a 12:12 light:dark cycle at ˜400:0 lux for the duration of the experiment. Ambient temperature was maintained at 22± 2 °C and humidity at 52 ± 7%, with food and water, or 10% blackcurrant squash (Morrisons) ± drug, available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Mice were group housed until the start of experimental recordings when they were individually housed, and kept in light-tight cabinets. Male mice aged 9 weeks at the beginning of the experiment were used.</p><p id="P41">Mice were implanted with TA-F10 radiotelemetry devices (Data Sciences International, USA) to record body temperature and locomotor activity. Radiotelemetry devices (sterilised in 2.5% Gluteraldehyde (G6257, Sigma) and rinsed with sterile saline) were implanted in the abdominal cavity of isofluorane anaesthetised mice (2-5% in oxygen, total duration ˜15 minutes), followed by a recovery period of 10 days. Body temperature and locomotor activity were recorded every 5 minutes throughout the experimental recording period. Locomotor activity monitoring was used to monitor mouse health during the experiment. Mice were included in the study if healing after implantation was complete, and no wound opening was observed. Mice were excluded if surgical wounds opened at any point during the experiment, or locomotor activity was absent for more than 6h during recording.</p><p id="P42">After a 2-day habituation period to the individual cages, baseline recording was collected for 2 full days. At ZT23, after the 2 full days of baseline recording and prior to the inactive period of mice, mice were given sodium nitrite (375mg/L, 23713, Sigma) diluted in 10% squash for palatability for 2 further full days with body temperature and locomotor activity recorded. To generate average day profiles during baseline or sodium nitrate phases of the experiment, 15-minute bins of body temperature were averaged across the two days of recording for each mouse. The average daily profile of all mice was plotted against time of day. To quantify effect of nitrite on body temperature, controlling for locomotor activity and time of day, each 15-minute bin of body temperature was categorised as belonging to ‘active’ or ‘inactive’ locomotor periods based on whether locomotor activity during the bin was higher or lower, respectively, than the individual’s median activity across the whole 2-day experimental recording period. The median threshold was chosen to keep the number of ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ bins similar, though a more stringent threshold of inactivity (total inactivity across 3 consecutive bins) was also assessed, and similar results observed. Body temperature in bins belonging to ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ periods were separated by time of day (light, day vs dark, night) and averaged for each mouse across the two days of recording. Thus, for each mouse, four separate average body temperatures were generated, belonging to inactive and active periods during the light phase, and inactive and active periods during the dark phase. Average body temperatures for the ‘inactive’ and ‘active’ periods in light and dark phases were compared across baseline and sodium nitrite phases of the experiment by repeated measures three-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P43">All graphs and analyses were performed in Prism 8 (Graphpad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA) and R (version 3.6.3) in R Studio (version 1.2.5033, RStudio Inc). Least squares non-linear regression curve fitting in GraphPad Prism (v7.03, GraphPad; La Jolla, CA) was used to determine whether circadian rhythms were present in quantified data by comparing straight line fit and damped cosine fit with the extra sum-of-squares F test as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beale <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Pulse co-oximetry data was analysed for significant rhythmicity by autocorrelation in R and subsequent damped cosine curve fitting as above. Mean ± SEM is reported throughout.

In the rest phase (night for humans; day for mice), increasing stabilisation of the R state of haemoglobin as levels of metHb rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bunn &amp; Forget, 1986</xref>) leads to an increase in affinity for O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Monod <italic>et al</italic>, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Perutz, 1970</xref>) and an increased nitrite reductase activity of deoxyHb at low pO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Grubina <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The subsequent export of increased concentrations of NO, via an N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Basu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), leads to increased vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cosby <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Crawford <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and thus increased heat loss. In the active phase, the concentration of metHb is lower, reducing deoxyHb nitrite reductase activity and thus RBC-produced NO. When fully oxygenated, oxyHb inactivates NO, or NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, to nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Herold &amp; Shivashankar, 2003</xref>), reducing vasodilation. Taken together, the daily variation in metHb and its effect on the production and export of NO, and subsequent vasodilation, is predicted to lead to a daily variation in body temperature due to daily variation in vasodilation-mediated cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Krauchi &amp; Wirz-Justice, 1994</xref>).</p><p><bold>B</bold> Whole blood samples were taken from mice during the early rest phase (day, ZT3), early active phase (night, ZT15), or during the early active phase from mice which received supplemental dietary nitrite (50mg/l) for 10 days.
