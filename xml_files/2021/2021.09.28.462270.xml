<abstract>
<p id="P2">The genome of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been sequenced at an unprecedented scale, leading to a tremendous amount of viral genome sequencing data. To understand the evolution of this virus in humans, and to assist in tracing infection pathways and designing preventive strategies, we present a set of computational tools that span phylogenomics, population genetics and machine learning approaches. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets, enabling real-time analyses. Furthermore, time series change of Tajima’s D provides a powerful metric of population expansion. Unsupervised learning techniques further highlight key steps in variant detection and facilitate the study of the role of this genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Multiscale PHATE methodology identifying fine-scale structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that underlies the emergence of key lineages. The computational framework presented here is useful for real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and could be applied to any pathogen that threatens the health of worldwide populations of humans and other organisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible virus responsible for the current ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded, 29,903 nucleotide long RNA genome. The virus’ genome is accumulating mutations at a steady pace since its introduction into human hosts. Genomic surveillance and the identification of variants of concern (VOC) and their impact on transmission, disease severity and immune response, are of tremendous importance to pandemic control, most notably in the context of worldwide vaccination efforts. In this context, an unparalleled wealth of chronologically and globally sampled viral genomes have been sequenced in a concerted public effort and submitted to public databases such as the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">In attempt to track the transmission and spread of emerging lineages, several lineage nomenclatures have been proposed, the most commonly used ones being the clades from NextStrain (phylogenetic approach) and Pangolin annotations (decision tree approach implemented in pangoLEARN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Additionally, the World Health Organization assigns Greek letters to Variants of Concerns (VOCs), Variants Being Monitored (VBM), and Variants Of Interest (VOI). VOCs started emerging at the end of the first year of the pandemic, with the first one to be reported being the Alpha variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Shortly after that, several other variants have attracted attention from the scientific community and public health bodies, amongst them Beta, Gamma, and Lambda, and more recently, the Delta variant which is becoming globally dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Historically, phylogenetics is used to describe relationships between sequences, however, it is becoming more computationally intensive to use with the increasing number of closely related sequences made available on GISAID. Alternatively, by taking advantage of established population genetics paradigms that study the evolution of mutation frequencies in time, we may be able to describe and analyze the increasingly large datasets. For instance, an early study constructed a haplotype network to visualise circulating lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). While phylogenetic approaches assume that the ancestral sequences are unobserved and represented by internal nodes, a haplotype network approach is appropriate when internal nodes actually are observed, because some sampled sequences are ancestral to others. This is the case for the current sampling scheme of pandemic sequences worldwide, despite many sampling biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Tajima’s D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), a classical population genetics approach, can be used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 lineage expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Dimensionality reduction techniques summarizing genetic diversity are also widely employed to investigate population structure. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to investigate the population structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus early in the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), an unsupervised learning technique that has become increasingly popular in genomics in recent years, was previously used on GISAID sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). More recently, a novel unsupervised method, Multiscale PHATE (msPHATE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), was used for COVID-19 clinical data in combination with SARS-CoV-2 genetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Here, we used genomics data collected in GISAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) from the fist year of the pandemic (January to December 2020, downloaded on January 19th 2021) to present a computational genomics pipeline for large-scale viral genetic profiling using a collection of established population genetics approaches and data visualisation strategies. Using these tools, we characterize the full scale of mutational diversity during the pre-vaccination phase of the pandemic. We show that these methods are useful to characterize the evolutionary steps undertaken by the virus during its early adaptation to the human host. This computational framework can help design efficient preventive strategies and derive fast response against viral adaptation to future therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Viral Genetic Data Pre-processing</title>
<p id="P7">A key challenge in working with large datasets to extract meaningful information from genomic data is a careful pre-processing of the data to exclude low quality sequences, artefacts due to batch effects, and missing data. GISAID has very stringent submission guidelines and quality checks, which already guarantees data of good quality, but we’ve added several pre-processing steps (Step 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which lead us to flag a series of systematic errors due to sequencing and bioinformatics methodologies (Methods). From the raw fasta file with 384,407 consensus sequences available in GISAID on January 19th 2021, we obtained a high-quality dataset of a total of 329,854 consensus sequences. Sequencing coverage across world regions is heavily biased, as we have 4194 sequences from Africa, 23499 sequences from Asia, 210624 sequences from Europe, 72774 from North America, 15009 sequences from Oceania and 3735 sequences from South America. We aligned these high-quality sequences and extracted all RNA substitutions compared to the reference sequence (NC_045512.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and imputed all sequences at 199 positions where derived allele frequency (DAF) was over 1% in at least one month using ImputeCoVNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This novel approach is a 2D ResNet Autoencoder which has been shown to have an accuracy of &gt; 99% and surpasses distance-based methods in terms of computation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), which is a major advantage in such a large dataset. We then built a harmonized database of RNA substitutions (Step 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) that contains a total of 24,802 mutated genomic positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Since most of the consensus sequences in this dataset are from the UK (43%) and from USA (20%), we define two waves in the first year of the pandemic, corresponding to the two successive global increase of COVID-19 cases observed in countries that implemented strict containment measures in March 2020 and then relaxed these measures in the summer 2020, with the limitation that countries from the southern hemisphere had offset waves due to seasonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The first wave encompasses sequences sampled from January to end of July 2020, and the second wave encompasses those sampled from August to December 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We identified 20,403 substitutions within the first wave consensus sequences and 22,210 in the second wave, when compared to the reference genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Each of these mutated positions were further categorized based on their frequency of occurrence in the global host population during the first and second waves of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Singletons make up 23% and 17% of the first and second wave mutations, respectively: because these mutations are only seen in one sequence in each wave, they are most likely enriched in sequencing errors. Doubletons (mutations seen twice during a wave), account for 14% (first wave) and 11% (second wave) of the mutations, in line with an expanding population. There are 5% (first wave) and 11% of mutations found in more than 100 sequences in the first and second wave, respectively, where most impactful mutations on viral fitness will be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Derived Allele Frequency (DAF) Trajectories Through Time</title>
<p id="P9">Expanding viral lineages will arbour a set of prevalent genetic mutations that will quickly increase in frequency over the course of a epidemic. To detect these mutations during the COVID-19 pandemic’s first year, we considered their derived allele frequencies (DAF) over time (Step 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In the first wave, 20 RNA substitutions reached a DAF of 10% for at least one month (January to July) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Four mutated positions are in linkage disequilibrium with each other, as evidenced by their DAF trajectories overlapping, meaning that they co-occurred together. Three of these substitutions are C-to-U mutations (C241U, C3037U, C4408U), the last one is A23403G in the Spike protein (S:D614G). These four substitutions have increased very quickly in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, red DAF trajectory): this lineage was the first to become dominant and did so in a few months, climbing to 71% in March (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is thought that S:D614G is the driver of this event and has been shown to have a selective advantage for SARS-CoV-2 which is conferred by an increase of transmission and viral load in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Three consecutive co-occurring substitutions G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C also increased in frequency during the first wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, purple DAF trajectory). It is the only change of three consecutive nucleotides, or triplet, that reached a DAF over 1% in the first year of the pandemic, an event that is unlikely to arise by chance alone, and could represent an adaptive change occurring on a codon. These three mutations span two amino acids in the N protein, leading to N:R203K and N:G204R. However, in the overlapping gene ORF9c (or ORF14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) they form a single codon mutated from GGG to AAC, causing a single missense change in the resulting protein (ORF9c:G50N). Interestingly, ORF9c is a novel gene in SARS-CoV-2 compared to known human coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), coding for a putative transmembrane protein. Additionally, this codon change significantly disrupt the RNA secondary structure of this specific region of SARS-CoV-2 genome, making a stable hairpin become a ’wobbly’ loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Finally, the first wave was marked by the increase in frequency of this group of five co-occuring substitutions: A1163T, T7540C, G16647T, C18555T, G22992A, G23401A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, yellow DAF trajectory). This lineage peaked in July 2020 and was mainly circulating and contained in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Overall, the second wave is marked by an increase in the number of highly transmitted mutations: from August to December, there is an increase in the number of substitutions with high DAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), for a total of 53 mutations. However, among the 33 new high-frequency substitutions, the DAF trajectories show two well-defined groups, representing two different lineages: one with mutation S:A222V at genomic position 22227 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, dashed green DAF trajectories) and a lineage with mutation S:N501Y at position 23063 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, dashed plum DAF trajectories). The lineage with S:A222V corresponds to 20E in NextStrain annotations, and was first reported by Rambault and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This lineage has accumulated 11 co-occurring mutations since its appearance, and was mostly seen in European countries. The lineage with S:501Y mainly corresponds to the NextStrain 20I, now commonly known as the Alpha variant, which accumulated 22 co-occurring high frequency mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p>

<title>Haplotype Networks for Fast Evolutionary Clustering of Sequences</title>
<p id="P11">The generation of haplotype networks is a widely used approach for analysing and visualizing the relationships between sequences within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The nodes of the network are haplotypes, edges represent mutated genetic positions that vary between two nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The size of the nodes generally varies to represent the number of sequences for a specific haplotype. In the case where there is very little to no recombination, this approach results in a minimum spanning tree. To keep the number of haplotypes tractable for informative visualization, we defined them by selecting the 22 mutations displayed in the DAF trajectories that are most representative (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> underlined positions, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). We generated a haplotype network (Step 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) using a technique that takes the time of sampling into account (Methods). We included the 122 haplotypes with more than 10 sequences in our representation, ignoring rare events. The final haplotype network includes 17 main haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), representing the main genetic lineages circulating during the pandemic’s first year, and several ”descendant” haplotypes. Haplotype I include all sequences with ancestral states at each position (ie. reference haplotype), and haplotype XV corresponds mainly to the Alpha variant, and differs from the reference haplotype at 8 positions.</p>
<p id="P12">To further visualise the genetic diversity of the virus in the first two waves, we looked at the viral diversity during each wave of the pandemic using the haplotype network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). During the first wave, the haplotype network shows the presence of nine haplotypes with more than 200,000 sequences (II-V, VII-IX, XI, XII) diverging from the ancestral haplotype I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), with haplotypes II, III and VIII being the most prevalent, all carrying the S:D614G mutation. Most haplotypes are seen in several regions of the world, albeit at different frequencies (eg. V arose mainly in Asia and II mainly in North America), except for haplotype XI. This latter lineage (Pangolin D.2) was mostly circulating in Australia (encompasses 92.8% of all high-quality Australian sequences in GISAID in July 2020). First detected in June 2020, this variant almost completely vanished as of October 2020. The second wave is marked by a critical decrease in the prevalence of haplotypes without the S:D614G mutation (I, IV, VII and XII) that have almost become extinct by August 2020, and the fast increase in prevalence of haplotypes VI, XIV and XV, arising mainly in Europe. Other novel region-specific haplotypes (XIII in North America, XVI in Europe, XVII in Africa) arose during this wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, the second wave was marked by the appearance of lineages with mutational jumps on haplotype VI and XV (Supplementary Text, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) using root-to-tip estimates of mutational rates in each haplotype lineage (Methods).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Comparison to Phylogenetic Reconstruction</title>
<p id="P13">To compare the haplotype network to a more standard phylogenetic approach (Step 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), we generated a divergence tree using FastTree along with other complementary tools (Methods), as recommended in multiple published pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). With these approaches, using all 329,854 sequences is unfeasible, therefore sub-sampling is needed (Methods) which can bias the representation of the circulating diversity of the viral population. In contrast, the haplotype network can be built with all available sequences, while recapitulating the phylogenetic structure quite accurately, despite some lineage splitting, particularly of haplotype I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The phylogenetic approach sometimes wrongly combines very distant lineages, for example lineage I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, arrow) where further inspection of these sequences put into doubt the relationship reported by the phylogenetic tree. Indeed, the haplotype annotations allow to identify problems in the phylogeny that would otherwise go undiscovered, technical issues that can then be corrected by additional tools and manual adjustments (Supplementary Text, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, the haplotype network allows easy representation of recurrent mutations, for instance, the C-to-U mutation at position 14805 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>), which emerged on three different backgrounds (IV,XII,XIII).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Comparison to Other Lineage Annotation Systems</title>
<p id="P14">Our haplotype definition is well in line with NextStrain lineage definition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), though some distinctions exist. For instance the haplotype approach can differentiate sequences from haplotype I and IV, differing by two substitutions (genomic positions 26144,14805), and from III and IX, differing at position 25583, whereas NextStrain does not differentiate these lineages, grouping them into 19A and 20A, respectively. In contrast, our categorization of sequences by haplotype and the Pangolin annotation methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) do not concord well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), with, for instance, the B.1 lineage spanning many genetically distant haplotypes: sequences from haplotype II and VIII can be assigned to the same generic B.1, while these differ by a total of five high frequency mutations, including the triplet at 28881-28883. Conversely, lineages B.1.1, B.1.2, B.1.5 are sublineages of haplotypes VIII, II, and III, respectively, defined by mutations that never surpassed 10% worldwide. These inconsistencies between the genetic background of different Pangolin lineages, and the greater granularity observed compared to NextStrain lineages justifies the usage of haplotype categories for the analyses of genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. However, the haplotype definition based only on these 22 most prevalent mutations in 2020 does not differentiate all VOCs. For example, the sequences of the Gamma variant discovered in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), which also has the substitution at position 23063 (S:N501Y) as well as the triplet, are grouped with Alpha sequences in haplotype XV.</p>

<title>Time Series Change of Tajima’s D statistic to Detect Lineage Expansions in Real Time</title>
<p id="P15">The haplotype network representation informs on the overall size of clusters but lacks information on the lineages’ expansions over time, especially by geographical region. Population genetic statistics, most notably Tajima’s D, has been used to estimate epidemiological parameters of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and can detect population expansion and contraction events. Specifically, a strongly negative Tajima’s D value indicates a rapid population expansion, resulting in an excess of low-frequency alleles in the population. However, Tajima’s D is very sensitive to population structure and is therefore not meaningful when applied on a global scale. The genetically-informed grouping of sequences by haplotypes as well as stratification by world regions, however, allows to get closer to well-mixed viral populations, where Tajima’s D can be applied. For prevalent haplotypes in each continent, we thus computed Tajima’s D for each month of 2020 (Step 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) while controlling for sample size (Methods). We recognize that the uneven sequencing coverage across the continents may bias mutation rate estimates, therefore we avoided comparing regions. We then correlated Tajima’s D to the number of sequences per haplotype per continent and observed a moderate negative correlation (mean adjusted R2 = 0.24, s.d. = 0.23, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). This correlation is significant enough such that the time series of Tajima’s D recapitulates the major variations in the number of sequences per haplotype per month across each continent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Indeed, we observe a decrease of Tajima’s D through time for several haplotypes that either took over in a specific region or are known to have become dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B,C</xref>). For instance, in Africa, haplotype XVII (Beta) appears in October 2020 with a high Tajima’s D value compared to dominant haplotypes VIII and III and then shows a fast decrease of Tajima’s D in the next months, consistent with population expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This correlates with the drastic increase in number of sequences seen at the end of 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), reflecting the emergence of Beta in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Another striking event of this type is seen in Europe where the rapid increase of XV (Alpha) coincides with a steep decrease in Tajima’s D from October to December (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>). These events are also consistent with observations from Singh and Yi (2021) who tracked the spread of the corresponding Nextstrain clades (XV: Nextstrain 20I; XVII: Nextstrain 20H; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>)).</p>
<p id="P16">In North America, Tajima’s D for haplotype IX also shows a marked decrease from April to June, suggesting an expansion of this lineage, although its prevalence in the sampled population from GISAID did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This may reflect undersampling of specific populations in North America. Conversely, the rapid rise of haplotype XIII (Lambda) is captured both by Tajima’s D and sequence counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>). Other types of events can be seen, such as loss of lineages and lineages causing outbreaks that are quickly contained. An example of the former is seen in Asia where SARS-CoV-2 emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), where Tajima’s D for haplotype I sequences increases with time, suggesting a contraction of population size of the ancestral lineage, with haplotype VIII and V becoming dominant haplotypes by the end of 2020. The signature of a contained outbreak is seen in Oceania, where Tajima’s D distribution across time is U-shaped, indicating an increase in population size followed by a contraction, in line with sequence counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In South America, sample counts per haplotype suggests that haplotype VIII took over II and III by the end of 2020, but the low Tajima’s D values in August 2020 are inconsistent with a decrease of these lineages and suggests that the number of sequences assigned to these haplotypes is an underestimate in that region.</p>

<title>Visualizing viral fine-scale population structure using Principal Component Analyses (PCA)</title>
<p id="P17">To detect and visualize fine-scale structure in genetic variation, a common statistical approach is to use PCA of coded alleles at mutated positions segregating in populations. The projection of sequences onto the principal components is known to reflect the underlying (generally unknown) genealogical relationships between haploid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In the viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 from 2020, we performed PCA (Step 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) on viral mutations present in at least 10 sequences from the first and second wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The first two PCs describe the most variation between sequences and clearly show discrimination between haplotypes dominating during either of the two waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The coordinates of clusters relative to one another in the first wave concord with the haplotype network representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>): on PC1, the haplotypes without S:D614G are separated away from VIII and XI carrying the triplet mutations, whereas PC2 separates them from haplotypes II and IX, with haplotype III located at the center, in line with its intermediate position in the haplotype network. Additionally, the distance in the PC1/2 space between haplotype groups appears to recapitulates very well the genetic distance between them. For instance, haplotype III sequences are at least four mutations away from I, three mutations away from VIII, and two mutations away from II, reflecting distances between groups on the graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the second wave, PC1 and PC2 do not reflect these phylogenetic relationships as much, but rather highlight the most divergent groups, the major second wave lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both PCs show the XV group as an extreme group, which is explained by the major mutational jump of 22 mutations from haplotype VIII background defining Alpha. We can however see a subset of XV sequences clustering with VIII sequences, which are either precursor sequences of Alpha, or Gamma sequences. Beyond PC1 and PC2, other PCs from the two waves show additional structure within and between haplotype subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). For instance, PC3/4 of the first wave sequences show the divergence of haplotype XI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), the lineage dominating in Australia in the summer, whereas PC4/5 of the second wave sequences show the emergence of the haplotype XIII lineage (Beta) from its ancestral background on haplotype II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">We then used UMAP to further summarize the 20 first PCs, explaining a total of 2.82% and 7.32% of genetic variance in the first and second wave respectively, in a 2-dimensional plot (Methods). UMAP has shown some potential to describe population structure from genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), but in this case, despite the UMAP representation showing some clustering by haplotypes, many small groups of sequences are scattered around in an unstructured way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>), indicating that this technique may not be the most appropriate for visualisation of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, even when exploring several parameters (Methods).</p>

<title>Multiscale PHATE (msPHATE) for Data-driven Viral Lineage Groupings Across Granularities</title>
<p id="P19">PCA reveals insightful characteristics of the genetic data, and identifies major lineages, but grouping of data points (here, sequences) in PCA derived from genetic variation is known to be heavily influenced by uneven sampling of sequences, which means that the number of sequences sampled within sub-lineages will influence distances between subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This is not a desirable attribute for early detection of new differentiated sub-lineages, which are often sampled in lower numbers compared to the other well-established lineages. We thus explored the use of msPHATE on SARS-CoV-2 genetic data, a novel unsupervised learning technique that showed promising results on biological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), to enable the identification of additional structure within haplotype groups using whole viral consensus sequences (Step 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The method creates a tree of data granularities that can be cut at coarse levels for high-level summarizations of data, or at fine levels for detailed representations on subsets. The coarse level representation clusters sequences within groups which recapitulate the major circulating viral haplotypes during each wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Across different granularities, msPHATE is able to uncover viral sub-lineages: a finer level representation of the first wave sequence data reveals three separate clusters of haplotype II, and one of haplotype III clusters splits into five sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, right panel) and each subgroup mutational landscape can be inspected (Supplemental Text, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9B-D</xref>). One of the five subgroups is made of sequences belonging to haplotype XIV, which only became particularly prevalent during the second wave in Europe. This shows the potential of msPHATE to identify emerging lineages.</p>
<p id="P20">The finer level of the second wave embeddings shows very distinct patterns for the main circulating sub-lineages. There were many different sublineages for XVI sequences compared to XV subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, left panel). Zooming into the haplotype XV clusters, we identified several sub-lineages (C1-8), which showed different mutational landscapes. For each of these subgroups, we can detailed their mutational landscape by deriving mutational graphs (Step 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These graphs are stratified histograms of DAF for genomic positions that differ from the reference sequence in at least one subgroup, allowing comparison of lineages’ mutational landscape. The mutational graph of the eight XV subgroups, as defined by msPHATE, shows unique mutational events that define specific clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> right). The C1 cluster shows all Alpha-defining mutations, but no other mutation has reached a DAF of 25% within this group, whereas the other clusters C2-7 have accumulated additional mutations. Notably, C5 and C6 present the ORF8:K68* nonsense mutation at genomic position 28095, a mutation at low frequency by the end of December 2020, but which quickly increased in frequency in the first months of 2021. Indeed, it was found in over 80% of Alpha sequences by September 2021, revealing a potentially beneficial mutation on Alpha background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). While Gamma was found in a msPHATE grouping with other VIII sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), we detected an additional subgroup of XV, cluster C8, which does not have the same mutational landscape as the rest of the XV sub-lineages. This lineage (Pangolin lineage AP.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), despite having experienced an independent mutational jump of 7 mutations at once, disappeared early in 2021.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P21">The world-wide efforts to sequence and share thousands of viral genome sequences made possible in depth tracking of the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 over time as it spread across the world. However, processing, analysis, and interpretation of hundreds thousands of sequences and mutation events is a challenging task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, we first propose a pre-processing pipeline to improve downstream analysis by using only high-quality data. Imputation of missing alleles at key positions facilitated haplotype annotation and therefore lineage tracing. Detection of spurious sites due to sequencing errors and bias is also an important step, and data analysts should be careful about these when processing large amount of genomic data, especially in a small genome of 29Kb, where by now, every position in the genome has been affected by sequencing errors.</p>
<p id="P22">We tested population genetics approaches to explore and identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Allele frequency tracing through time is a widely used population genetics approach that can monitor circulating lineages over time. SARS-CoV-2 evolution experienced a period of relative evolutionary stasis during its first months infecting human hosts, which is consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Mutations with increased fitness started emerging and led to a number of variants of concern, some of which are the leading cause of current infections. Indeed, the second wave of the pandemic was marked by the appearance of lineages with mutational jumps, explaining the increase in the number of substitutions, which may reflect adaptive steps in the evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 within the human host, with the virus acquiring selective advantages to the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Finally, this approach of analyzing worldwide frequencies of mutated positions allows a comprehensive picture of the virus’ strategies to developing new mutations and therefore lineages, exemplified by the observation of the Alpha variant emerging, starting in October (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) but was only reported at the end of December (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">The nomenclature has become increasingly complex with the number of lineages and sub-lineages emerging throughout the world. We explored tracing of lineages using a haplotype network, that was generated using the most frequent mutational events in a given time period, to clarify the genetic background of VOCs in 2020. Interestingly, Delta variant is accompanied with one of the triplet mutations, G to A at position 28881 (N:R203M), such that this variant emerges in the third wave network. It is easy to accommodate new mutations as new haplotypes can be generated with any mutational events of interest on any region of interest, such as the Spike protein, the main vaccines target currently.</p>
<p id="P24">We captured the expansion and decline of major circulating haplotype populations in each continent, and correlate them to sequences counts using Tajima’s D, a classical neutrality test statistic. Some inconsistencies between Tajima’s D predicted expansions and decrease in sequence counts could be an indication of undersampling in a given region. Sampling biases are numerous in this dataset, and attempts to correct them may also lead to other systematic errors. Furthermore, it is a very unbalanced dataset in terms of sampling countries, with 144,376 (44%) of the sequencing effort during the first year done in the UK. Global strategies aiming at a more uniformly distributed between countries sequencing effort would be able to identify earlier emerging variants. Population structure during the first year of the pandemic, was successfully visualized using PCA and msPHATE, and showed global and more fine-scale structure for each wave. The fine level of msPHATE embeddings were able to identify an outlier cluster during the first wave that dominated during the second wave (haplotype XIV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, msPHATE embeddings can identify sub-lineages with the potential of becoming a variant of concern, and can recapitulate hierarchical relationships between sub-lineages.</p>
<p id="P25">In conclusion, we presented a series of computational and population genetics tools to ease the lineage tracing of SARS-CoV-2 variants and predict emerging ones. We also presented a novel application for msPHATE as a method to analyze viral genetics data, and as a lineage surveillance method. Together, these approaches constitute a comprehensive toolbox to allow the scientific community to continually and closely monitor the evolution of any viral population. In the case of the ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, developing a dynamic, global and up-to-date understanding of viral evolutionary strategies will be of utmost importance to rapidly respond to emerging variants, identify increasingly infectious or vaccine-resistant lineages, and identify at-risk populations.</p>

We then removed samples from non-human hosts as well as those with incomplete sequences (&lt; 29, 000bp), for a total of 339,427 sequences. Each consensus sequence was mapped separately to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using minimap2 2.17-r974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). All mapped sequences are then merged back with all others in a single alignment bam file. The variant calling is done using bcftools mpileup v1.9. <italic>

</italic> in haploid calling mode. Sequences are processed by batches of 1000 sequences to overcome technical issues in processing of very low frequency variants within a bam file. Once the variant calling is obtained for each batch, INDELS are removed and bcftools merge was used to merge all the variant calls across the entire dataset. Variants located in both ends of the genome, which have high-level of missingness (&gt;20%, positions 1-54 and 29838-29903) were excluded. We then flagged spurious variants within these sequences (see below) and identified 361 samples with at least two flagged positions, which we removed from our dataset. Of the remaining 339,066 sequences, we excluded sequences without GISAID metadata and with incomplete sampling date (sampling month unavailable), which resulted in a final dataset of 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences. We divided this dataset into two pandemic waves: 139,515 sequences with a submission date between January 1st and July 31st 2020 were defined as first wave samples, and 190,339 sequences with a submission date between August 1st and December 31st 2020 where defined as second wave samples. A mutation database is built using the sqlite3 library. Only positions that are variant from the reference, including missing calls, were included in the <italic>position</italic> table of the SQL database.

We additionally developed a tool to flag spurious variant within consensus sequences due by sequence misalignment in original labs, which we initially detected by manually inspecting consensus sequences. These errors were found in larger proportion in the sequences uploaded to GISAID in the early stages of the pandemic. Our approach identifies substitutions compared to the reference genome that are located within 10 genomic positions of stretches of ”N”, defined as at least 5 consecutive Ns. This strategy was applied to the 339,427 consensus sequences from human host, we identified 2,164 sequences with at least one flagged position (0.6%). Among these, flagged positions where the mutated allele otherwise reached 1% in one of the pandemic waves (for a total of 199 positions) were considered as real mutations and not as spurious sites. A total of 6,736 spurious sites were detected and the variant allele was replaced by N in the sequences. Furthermore, we removed 361 samples with at least two flags.

<p id="P28">For the 199 positions reaching 1% derived allele frequency (DAF) in the consensus sequences of one of the two pandemic waves, we imputed the missing alleles using ImputeCoVNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Briefly, ImputeCoVNet is a 2D convolutional ResNet autoencoder that aims at learning and reconstructing SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the help of two sub-networks: (1) an encoder which is responsible to embed the given input into a low-dimensional vector, and (2) a decoder that is responsible for reconstructing that sequence from that low-dimensional vector. During training, the encoder network takes as input complete sequences encoded with a one-hot representation and the decoder outputs a reconstructed version. Once trained, the model is used to infer missing values within incomplete sequences: the missing alleles at previously defined positions of interest are predicted by the model during reconstruction. We evaluated imputation accuracy on sequences without missing data and reached an accuracy of 99.12% on this set of mutated positions.

We obtained a total of 463 unique haplotypes, and only those with more than 50 sequences were kept, for a total of 56 haplotypes. A haplotype network representing distance relationships between haplotypes was built. Because SARS-CoV-2 sequences were sampled sequentially through time, the haplotype network takes the temporal dimension into account. We split the year into 24 intervals representing half-months and each consensus sequence was attributed to one time interval. For each time interval, a haplotype network is generated using the haplonet function of the pegas R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) by including only sequences that occurred before or within this time interval. The networks were merged iteratively over time. At each step, if the merging creates a cycle (ie. the addition of a haplotype that is linked with two previously linked haplotypes) we removed the branches of the cycle that link the haplotypes for which the first occurrence was the longest timeframe. If many links had the longest timeframe, we removed the link between the more differentiated haplotypes. This process solved several time inconsistencies.

<title>Tajima’s D</title>
<p id="P32">To track SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes’ spread, we used a population genetic metrics that can infer changes in effective population sizes by comparing the contribution of low- and intermediate-frequency mutations to viral genomic diversity, i.e. Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989). We calculated Tajima’s D at the continent level to be able to relate its time series to the haplotype network. For each haplotype and each of the 12 months of the first and second waves, we randomly sampled 20 viral consensus sequences from each continent to calculate Tajima’s D, and repeat this procedure 500 times to obtain confidence intervals. Lineages or time bins with fewer than 20 sequences were discarded. This sub-sampling method allowed us to control for differences in sample size across continents and time, although sampling biases inevitably result in reduced detected diversity. After calculating Tajima’s D, we correlated it to the number of sequences per haplotype per continent per month, which we used as a proxy for the number of cases per haplotype per continent per month. We also performed this correlation for each haplotype separately. We evaluated the significance of the correlation using the permutational ANOVA (n=5000 permutations) implemented in the R package ”lmPerm” (v.2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).

Triallelic and Quadriallelic sites are here coded as separate mutations. Missing data is encoded as reference allele. We used the incremental PCA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a python library that was also used on the data projected on the 20 first components of the PCA using the default parameters of the algorithm. In order to have the better fit, we explore each pair of those parameters: minimum distance [0.01, 0.05, 0.3, 0.8, 0.99] and neighbor numbe:r [10, 50, 80, 100, 200]. The code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HussinLab/covid19_mostefai2021_paper">https://github.com/HussinLab/covid19_mostefai2021_paper</ext-link>. Finally, msPHATE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) (package available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/Multiscale_PHATE">https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/Multiscale_PHATE</ext-link>) embeddings were computed for the first and second waves GISAID high quality consensus sequences. A 0123 encoded matrix was used for each wave to generate the MS-PHATE embeddings. For a given position, the 0123 encoding is as follow: 0 encodes for the reference allele, and 1 2 and 3 encode for the 3 derived allele in decreasing frequency order independently for each wave. MS-PHATE returns embeddings and clusters at all granularities and we chose salient levels based on gradient analysis for visualization. Each dot in the plot consists of a group of samples in the original data, and we color the dots using the majority vote of haplotype. MS-PHATE provides the relationship between groups existing at different granularities and we use that to identify subgroups on finer levels comparing to a coarse level.</p>

<title>A Data-driven Methodological Pipeline for Analyzing Viral Genomic Data</title>
<p>This workflow recapitulates the major analysis steps used to analyse SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequence data inputted in GISAID during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dark blue arrows represent steps where all positions are kept (except spurious sites), blue arrows represents steps where subsets of positions are kept (indicated next to the arrow), yellow boxes represented filtering steps at the level of sequences, light bleu boxes represent the methodological steps and the main steps are numbered from Step 1 to Step 9. These population genetics and unsupervised learning methods constitute a comprehensive toolbox to allow the scientific community to efficiently monitor the evolution of the virus.</p>

<title>Viral Genetic Diversity During the First Year of the Pandemic.</title>
<p>Derived Allele Frequencies (DAF) over time of representative high-frequency substitutions during the first (January-July) and second (August-December) wave of the pandemic. Only positions that exceed a DAF of 10% for a given month are shown. Positions with highly correlated DAF trajectories (<italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> &gt; 99) have the same line color. Solid lines are used for mutations appearing in the first wave. (B) Haplotype network representing genetic subtypes based on representative mutations (position underlined in A). Genomic positions that differs between two nodes (haplotypes) are specify on edges. Nodes are colored by haplotype and node size represent the number of consensus sequences for each haplotype. The 17 main haplotypes are annotated with roman numerals. (C) Divergence tree made from 15,690 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences using FastTree and TreeTime. The haplotype network built from prevalent mutations using all high-quality consensus sequences recapitulates well the phylogeny.</p>

<title>Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences in Space and Time</title>
<p>Haplotype network of the first (A) and second (B) wave. Node size represent the number of consensus sequences for each haplotype and pie charts represent continental proportions for each haplotype. (C) GISAID consensus sequence counts (on a log10 scale) of the most prevalent haplotypes in each continent during the first year of the pandemic. (D) Tajima’s D estimates of the three most prevalent haplotypes in each continent for the first year of the pandemic. Boxplots represent 500 resampled estimates of Tajima’s D from random resamplings of 20 genome sequences for each month with at least 20 sequences. Both the haplotype network and Tajima’s D are insightful tools to detect expanding lineages at a given point in time.</p>

<title>Viral Population Structure During the First and Second Wave of the Pandemic</title>
<p>Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of genetic diversity of the first (A,C) and second (B,D) wave consensus sequences reveal the population structure of the 17 main haplotypes in each wave. Genetic variation present in at least 10 genomes is used. The PCA is computed with all sequences, and only the sequences from the 17 main haplotypes are projected. Identical sequences are projected onto the same coordinates, therefore the number of sequences represented by each point is proportional to the size of the dots, with added transparency. PC1 and PC2 show differentiation between the main lineages from the two waves (A,B). The variant responsible for the Australian outbeak stands out clearly on PC3 from the first wave (C) and the Lambda variant sequences (XIII) are shown as the most distal subgroup on PC4 and PC5 from the second wave (D), in opposition to sequences from haplotype VI (on PC4) and subgroups of haplotype III (on PC5). The PCA recapitulates insightful characteristics of the evolutionary relationships of sequences and identifies major lineages from the two pandemic waves.</p>

<title>Viral Population Structure Using a Novel Reduction Technique Multiscale PHATE (msPHATE)</title>
<p>(A) Coarse (left) and fine (right) grain visualizations of msPHATE embedding generated from genetic diversity of the first wave consensus sequences. The clusters are colored by majority vote. Subsets of haplotype II and III can be seen in the finer level. (B) Fine grain visualizations of msPHATE embedding of genetic diversity of the second wave consensus sequences (left). Zooming into haplotype XV clusters reveals 8 clusters (sub-lineages). Gamma variant is part of an VIII cluster that is marked with a star symbol. Mutated positions in each cluster group of haplotype XV are listed along the x-axis in the order they appear on the genome (right). Mutations in at least 25% of the samples for each haplotype XV cluster are represented as a bar, and the corresponding amino acid changes are shown on the bars (blank bars represent synonymous mutations). Genomic position annotation was done using SnpEFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). All the clusters share the mutation S:N501Y which characterize the haplotype XV. msPHATE embeddings allow the early detection of small subgroups of emerging lineages and can highlight putative variants of concern.</p>
