<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P3">On the 24<sup>th</sup> November 2021 the sequence of a new SARS CoV-2 viral isolate spreading rapidly in Southern Africa was announced, containing far more mutations in Spike (S) than previously reported variants. Neutralization titres of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic as well as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta are substantially reduced or fail to neutralize. Titres against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in cases both vaccinated and infected by Delta. Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of a large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development. Omicron S has structural changes from earlier viruses, combining mutations conferring tight binding to ACE2 to unleash evolution driven by immune escape, leading to a large number of mutations in the ACE2 binding site which rebalance receptor affinity to that of early pandemic viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Since the end of 2020 a series of viral variants have emerged in different regions where some have caused large outbreaks, Alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Supasa et al., 2021</xref>) and more recently Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>) have had the greatest global reach, whilst Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), Gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b</xref>) and Lambda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Colmenares-Mejia et al., 2021</xref>), although causing large outbreaks in Southern Africa and South America, did not become dominant in other parts of the World. Indeed, Beta was later displaced by Delta in South Africa.</p>
<p id="P5">The rapid emergence of Omicron (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https:www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(bi1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern">https:www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(bi1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern</ext-link>) on the background of high Beta immunity implies that the virus may have evolved to escape neutralization by Beta specific serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>). Within S, Omicron has 30 substitutions plus the deletion of 6 and insertion of 3 residues, whilst in all the other proteins there are a total of 16 substitutions and 7 residue deletions. Particular hotspots for the mutations are the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) (15 amino acid substitutions) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) (3 deletions totalling 6 residues, 1 insertion, 4 substitutions). In-depth studies by a large number of laboratories have shown the RBD and NTD as the site of binding of the most potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cerutti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rapp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Zost et al., 2020</xref>) and the RBD is the site of binding of various mAbs in clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Starr et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">S mediates cellular interactions. It is a dynamic, trimeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Walls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>) which can be lipid bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Toelzer et al., 2020</xref>) and tightly associated in a ‘closed’ form or unfurled to expose one or more RBDs allowing both receptor binding and increased access to neutralising antibodies. Once bound to a cell, S undergoes cleavage and a drastic elongation converting it to the post fusion form.</p>
<p id="P7">Most potent neutralizing antibodies target the ACE2 footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>) occupying ~880 A<sup>2</sup> at the outermost tip of the RBD (the neck and shoulders referring to the torso analogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>)), preventing cell attachment. A proportion of antibodies are able to cross-neutralize different variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>) and a few of these bind to a motif surrounding the N-linked glycan at residue 343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>). These antibodies, exemplified by S309 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>) can cross-react with SARS-CoV-1 but do not block ACE2 interaction and their mechanism of action may be to destabilize the S-trimer. Neutralizing anti-NTD mAbs do not block ACE2 interaction and bind to a so-called supersite on the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cerutti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>), however they generally fail to give broad protection as the supersite is disrupted by a variety of NTD mutations present in the variants of concern. Moreover, some NTD binding antibodies were shown to have an infectivity-enhancing effect by induction of S open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2021c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">A relation between higher binding affinity of the RBD to ACE2 and higher infectivity has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Starr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>). Indeed, mutations in the RBD of Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants are associated with an increased affinity towards ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Supasa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, yeast surface displayed selection of randomly mutated RBD selected for tighter ACE2 binding selected the mutations present in the variants of concern N501Y (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) and E484K (Beta, Gamma), variants of interest F490S (Lambda) or multiple other variants, for instance S477N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>). In addition, the mutation Q498R was selected, and shown to have a major contribution to binding (in epistasis with N501Y), raising the concern that a new variant that includes the different affinity enhancing mutations may arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">In this report, we study the neutralization of Omicron by a large panel of sera collected from convalescent early pandemic, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta infected individuals, together with vaccinees receiving three doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222) or the Pfizer BioNtech (BNT16b2) vaccines. There is widespread reduction in the neutralization activity of serum from multiple sources and we use these data to plot an antigenic map where Omicron is seen to occupy the most distant position from early pandemic viruses which form the basis for current vaccines.</p>
<p id="P10">We show that Omicron escapes neutralization by the majority of potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) arising after both early pandemic and Beta variant. Utilizing a large bank of structures (n=29) from panels of potent monoclonal antibodies we describe the mechanism of escape caused by the numerous mutations present in Omicron RBD, which includes most mAbs developed for prophylactic or therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baum et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Analysis of the binding of ACE2 to RBD and structural analysis of the Omicron RBD indicates that changes at residues 498 and 501 of the RBD have locked ACE2 binding to the RBD in that region sufficiently strongly to enable the generation of a plethora of less favourable changes elsewhere, providing extensive immune escape and in the process resulting in a final net affinity for ACE2 similar to the early pandemic virus.</p>

<title>Phylogeny of Omicron</title>
<p id="P12">On average, a mutation is inserted into the genome of SARS-CoV-2 every second infection. Such mutations generate intra-host diversity upon which selection then acts, with the viral load being a critical parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Valesano et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, the virus is constantly changing. The median number of sequences that harbor a mutation at any given position is 570 (out of 4.7 million genomic sequences in GISAID; Nov 14, 2021), however rather few of these are enriched, with less than 10% of amino-acids having over 10,000 sequenced mutations. Enrichment of a mutation at a given position suggests increased virus fitness endowing a selective advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Martin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zahradnik et al., 2021c</xref>). If a specific mutation arises independently in different lineages, it implies an even greater advantage in fitness.</p>
<p id="P13">Omicron has changes throughout its proteome but S changes dominate, with 30 amino acid substitutions plus 6 residues deleted and 3 inserted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Ten of these were found previously in at least two lineages (D614G was mutated early on and maintained throughout). Of those ten, six have the same amino-acid substitution in &gt;75% of the sequences, and only one (E484A) has a unique substitution in Omicron (in Beta and Gamma it is a Lys). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref> shows the number of mutant sequences per residue at positions undergoing mutations in independent lineages. This can be interpreted in two ways, one is that the later mutations are epistatic to one another and thus are more difficult to reach, or that they do not contribute to virus fitness.</p>
<p id="P14">The Omicron RBD has 15 changes in total in the RBD, described below. The NTD also has numerous changes, including 4 amino acid substitutions, 6 amino acids deleted and 3 amino acids inserted, also described below. Several mutations found in Omicron occur in residues conserved in SARS-CoV-1 and many other Sarbecoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These observations agree with the Pango classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rambaut et al., 2020</xref>) which places Omicron at a substantial distance from all other variants.</p>
<p id="P15">Although S has the largest concentration of changes, there are mutations in many non-structural proteins. Nsp12 Polymerase (PDB:7B3B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gao et al., 2020</xref>) bears a single mutation in Omicron, P323L, distant from the active site targeted by compounds in use or in clinical trials, whilst the Nsp14 N-terminal exonuclease domain (PDB:7N0D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Moeller et al., 2021</xref>) important in proofreading, again has a single mutation, I42V, distal to the active site. These observations suggest that the large number of mutations in Omicron is not being driven by reduced polymerase fidelity. Nsp5 Mpro protease (PDB:7RFW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Owen et al., 2021</xref>) has a single mutation, P132H, distal to the active site targeted by the Pfizer PF-07321332 compound and Nsp3 has no mutations close to either the active site of the papain-like protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gao et al., 2021</xref>) or the macro domain inhibitor site. Whilst allosteric effects cannot be completely ruled out, there is little apparent significance to these changes which probably would not impact on small molecule therapeutics currently in use or development. This may reflect the lack of selective pressure to date on these proteins.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Mapping of Omicron RBD mutations compared to Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta</title>
<p id="P16">The Alpha variant has a single change in the RBD at N501Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Supasa et al., 2021</xref>) which occupies the right shoulder and contributes to the ACE2 binding footprint. Beta has two further mutations in the RBD: K417N and E484K, at back of the neck and left shoulder respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), also part of the ACE2 footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Gamma mutations are similar: K417T, E484K, N501Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b</xref>). Delta mutations, L452R front of neck, T478K far side of left shoulder, fall just peripheral to the ACE2 binding footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>). All of these variants have at least one RBD mutation in common with Omicron. Of the 15 Omicron changes in the RBD, nine map to the ACE2 binding footprint: K417N, G446S, S477N, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H with N440K and T478K just peripheral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Aside from these, mutations occur on the right flank: G339D, S371L, S373P and S375F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), the last three of which are adjacent to a lipid binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Toelzer et al., 2020</xref>). The lipid binding pocket has been seen occupied by a lipid similar to linoleic acid in an unusually rigid state of S where all RBDs are found in a locked-down configuration stabilised by lipid-bridged quaternary interactions between adjacent RBDs. However, this lipid bound form has been rarely seen, instead the pocket is usually empty and collapsed, with the RBD alternating between looser down and up conformations. We presume that this is because the pocket readily empties of lipid during protein purification, indeed rapidly prepared virus particles tend to have the RBDs closer to the locked down state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ke et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of lipid promotes RBD presentation to the target cell.</p>
<p id="P17">Until now the antigenic properties of variant viruses have been well described by assuming each change produces only a local change in structure and we will use this assumption in rationalising the serological impact of the changes in Omicron. We present structural data later to qualify this assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Omicron NTD mutations</title>
<p id="P18">The heavily mutated Omicron NTD possesses the 3 deletions found in Alpha, Delta has 1/3 substitutions in common with Omicron, whilst there are no NTD changes in common with Beta or Gamma. The mutations seen in the NTD lie on exposed flexible loops, which differ from those in SARS-CoV-1 and are likely to be antigenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In summary, the pattern of deletions and insertions seen in Omicron consistently moves those loops that are most different from SARS-CoV-1 to being more SARS-CoV-1-like, at least in length. Of the N1, N3 and N5 loops which comprise the antibody supersite, Omicron has a substitution at G142D and deletion of residues 143-145 in N3 which would mitigate against binding by a number of potent neutralizing antibodies e.g. 4A8 and 159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b</xref>). The deletion of residues 69 and 70 in N2 has also occurred in the Alpha variant whilst the deletion at residue 211, substitution at 212 and insertion at 214 are unique to Omicron. All these changes are on the outer surface and likely antigenic.</p>

<title>Neutralization of Omicron by Convalescent serum</title>
<p id="P19">We isolated Omicron virus from the throat swab of an infected case in the UK. Following culture in VeroE6 cells transfected with TMPRSS2 the S gene sequence was confirmed to be the Omicron consensus with the additional mutation A701V, which is present in a small number of Omicron sequences.</p>
<p id="P20">We have collected sera from individuals infected early in the pandemic (n=32) before the emergence of the variants of concern (VOC), along with cases infected with Alpha (n=18), Beta (n=14), Gamma (n=16) and Delta (n=42). Neutralization assays were performed against Omicron and compared with neutralization titres for Victoria (an early pandemic strain), Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.</p>
<p id="P21">In all cases neutralization titres to Omicron were substantially reduced compared to either the ancestral strain Victoria or to the homologous strain causing infection and in a number of cases immune serum failed to neutralize Omicron at 1/20 dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-E</xref>). Compared to Victoria the neutralization titres of sera for Omicron were reduced for early pandemic 16.9-fold (p&lt;0.0001), Alpha 33.8-fold (p&lt;0.0001), Beta 11.8-fold (p=0.0001), Gamma 3.1-fold (p=0.001) and Delta 1.7-fold (p=0.0182). Compared to the neutralization of homologous virus, for example Alpha virus by Alpha serum, Omicron neutralization was reduced for sera from Alpha 18.4-fold (p&lt;0.0001), Beta 22.5-fold (&lt;0.0001), Gamma 12.3-fold (p&lt;0.0001) and Delta 25.9-fold (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p id="P22">In summary, Omicron causes widespread escape from neutralization by serum obtained following infection by a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants meaning that previously infected individuals will have little protection from infection with Omicron, although it is hoped that they will still maintain protection from severe disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Vaccinated and infected sera show better neutralization of Omicron</title>
<p id="P23">We have collected sera from Delta infected cases and because Delta spread in the UK during the vaccination campaign, we obtained sera from three different groups; Delta infection only (n=19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), Delta infection following vaccination (n=9) or vaccination following Delta infection (n=8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Neutralization assays against early pandemic, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron viruses were performed. Compared to Delta-only infected individuals, sera from cases who had received vaccine and been infected by Delta showed substantially higher neutralization to all viruses tested; early pandemic, with Delta infected and vaccinated sera showing a 7.9-fold (p&lt;0.0001) increase in the neutralization of Omicron, compared to Delta infection alone. To confirm the boosting effect of vaccination we collected a paired blood sample from 6 Delta cases before and after vaccination which clearly demonstrates the boosting effect of infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">In summary, sera taken from convalescent cases previously infected with a variety of SARS CoV-2 variants show substantial reduction in neutralization titres to Omicron, likely indicating that these individuals will have little protection from reinfection with Omicron, although it is hoped they will retain some protection from severe disease. On the other hand, infection with Delta (and perhaps other variants) together with vaccination significantly boosts Omicron neutralization titres.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Increased neutralization of Omicron by third dose booster vaccination</title>
<p id="P25">In a number of countries such as the UK, booster programmes have been launched to counter waning immunity and the increasing frequency of break-through infections with Delta. To examine the effect of booster vaccination, we tested neutralization of Victoria, Delta and Omicron viruses using sera from individuals receiving 3 doses of ADZ1222 (n=41) or BNT162b2 (n=20). For ADZ1222, serum was obtained 28 days following the second and third doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). For BNT162b2, serum was obtained 28 days, 6 months, immediately prior to the third dose and 28 days following the third dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">At 28 days following the third dose, for ADZ1222, the neutralization titre to Omicron was reduced 12.7-fold (p&lt;0.0001) compared to Victoria and 3.6-fold (p&lt;0.0001) compared with Delta, for BNT162b2, the neutralization titre to Omicron was reduced 14.2-fold (p&lt;0.0001) compared to Victoria and 3.6-fold (p&lt;0.0001) compared to Delta. The neutralization titres for Omicron were boosted 2.7-fold (p&lt;0.001) and 34.2-fold (P&lt;0.001) following the third dose of ADZ1222 and BNT162b2 respectively compared to 28 days following the second dose. Of concern, and as has been noted previously, neutralization titres fell substantially between 28 days and 6 months following the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, although we did not measure titres 6 months following the second dose of AZD1222.</p>
<p id="P27">In summary, neutralization titres against Omicron are boosted following a third vaccine dose, meaning that the campaign to deploy booster vaccines should add considerable protection against Omicron infection.</p>

<sec id="S9">
<title>Effect of Omicron mutations on Wuhan antibody responses</title>
<p id="P28">We have previously reported a panel of 20 potent neutralizing antibodies (FRNT50 &lt; 100ng/ml) isolated from cases infected with early pandemic viruses (Wuhan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>). Neutralization assays against Omicron were performed and compared with neutralization of early pandemic, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta viruses; 17/20 mAbs failed to neutralize Omicron (FRNT50 &gt;10μg/ml) whilst the titres for mAbs 58, 222 and 253 were reduced 3.4, 12.6 and 19.3 -fold compared to Victoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">The binding sites of these antibodies were mapped together with other published structures to 5 epitopes (based on the position of the centre of gravity of each antibody) either by direct structural studies or competition analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>). According to the torso analogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>) these were designated: neck left shoulder, right shoulder, right flank and left flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref> we show the mapping of the density of centroids to the surface of the RBD with the Omicron mutations shown as spikes (the information is also mapped to the primary structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and selected antibody binding is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-G</xref>. As expected there is correlation between the two, although the antibody centroids are more broadly spread across the RBD surface, in particular there are no mutations in the left flank epitope, where a significant number of antibodies bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). These antibodies can neutralize in some assays, and confer protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>) and this cryptic epitope might therefore be an important target for therapeutic antibody applications and cross-protective vaccine antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrate the continued binding of this class of antibodies below.</p>
<p id="P30">Nineteen of the 20 most potent (FRNT50&lt;100ng/ml) neutralising monoclonal antibodies we isolated from early pandemic cases mapped to the ACE2 binding site across the neck and shoulder epitopes of the RBD and 5 of these classified as public IGVH3-53 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). Mapping these onto the RBD surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) shows that the centroids are highly concentrated in the neck region. IGVH3-53 mAbs were especially common in early pandemic responses and although their centroid is at the neck they are orientated such that their light chain CDRs interact with the right shoulder (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Most IGVH3-53 mAbs are sensitive to the N501Y mutation, although some such as mAb 222 or Beta-27 can still neutralize 501Y containing viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>). Omicron mutation Y505H makes a direct interaction with the L1 and L3 CDRs of mAb 222 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b</xref>). This, together with Q493R, which may also impact interaction with the H3 loop are likely responsible for the 12.6-fold reduction in the neutralization titre of mAb 222 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">MAb 253 as well as 55 and 165 are IGVH1-58 mAbs which bind an epitope shifted towards the left shoulder with H3 CDR contacting S477N and probably more importantly, Q493R may be disruptive, in this case approaching the H2 CDR, leading to the 19.3-fold reduction in neutralization of Omicron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P32">The neutralizing activity of mAbs 88, 316, and 384 is knocked out for Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), all interact with E484 (mAb 316 via H1 and H2) within the left shoulder epitope and the E484A mutation would be unfavourable. In the case of mAb 316, Q493 makes direct interactions with H1 and H3, thus Q493R will also likely be deleterious. Broadly neutralizing mAb 58 binds at the front of the RBD reaching towards the right flank in an area which is relatively clear of mutations and thus is unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). MAb 278 binds in a similar area but higher, the epitope comprising more of the right shoulder with L3 in contact with G446, and the G446S mutation in Omicron appears to knock out activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P33">MAb 170 will be affected by Q493R and Q498R, which make direct interactions with L1 and H3 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Q498R is between G496S and G446S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and these substitutions may act in concert but since G446 is in proximity to H1 together these mutations knock out the activity of mAb 170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Effect of Omicron mutations on Beta antibody responses</title>

This is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, where the focus on residues in the shoulders has spread the centroid patch out towards several Omicron mutation sites, this information is mapped to the primary structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and a schematic of the binding of the four potent cross-reactive antibodies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>.

In total 11 antibodies make contact with 501Y; <italic>Beta-<bold>6,10, 23, 24, 30</bold>, 40, 54, 55, 56</italic>, whilst Beta-22 and 29 bind epitopes dependent on 417N/T together with 501Y, (antibodies in italic are VH4-39 or 4-30 and the neutralization of Omicron for those in bold is completely knocked out). Beta MAbs targeting the back of the neck epitope (Beta-22,29,30) will be affected, for example in the case of Beta-29, H1 makes extensive interactions with residues Q493, G496 and Y505 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Beta-44 binding to the left shoulder epitope has already been shown to be sensitive to T478K whilst the combination of S477N and T478K in Omicron is likely to be more deleterious. Interestingly several of the antibodies (Beta <italic>40, 54, 55, 56</italic> and 22, 29 (501Y 417N/T)) retain some activity and this is explained below with reference also to the structure of the Omicron RBD/Fab 55 complex, where we suggest that this may reflect Omicron escape from early pandemic rather than Beta responses.</p>

<title>Effect on RBD/ACE2 Interaction</title>
<p id="P44">Fitness of a virus can stem from higher infectivity or evasion of the immune system. One way to identify mutations that increase binding affinity is by selection using a randomly mutated RBD displayed on the yeast surface for ACE2 binding. Mutations fixed for higher affinity binding included N501Y, E484K, S477N and most prominently, Q498R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>). Interestingly, Q498R was selected only at later stages. This is explained by the 2-fold reduction in affinity as a single mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in combination with the N501Y mutation, the affinity is increased 26-fold, more than any other mutation analyzed. Adding to this the S477N mutation, one obtains a 37-fold increase in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These three mutations, selected through <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution, were found together for the first time in the Omicron variant.</p>
<p id="P45">We measured the affinity of Omicron RBD for ACE2 and perhaps surprisingly, the affinity was on a par with that of the early virus, 8 nM and 7 nM respectively (these and binding affinities for a variety of other RBDs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>), implying that the increased affinity imparted by S477N, Q498R and N501Y are being offset by other mutations in the ACE2 footprint. We measured the affinities of the other single mutations in the ACE2 binding footprint of Omicron, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, C</xref>, and they provide a rationale for this. T478K in the presence of N501Y decreased the positive effect of the later by 2-fold. Y505H reduces binding of Q498R, N501Y double mutant by 50%. G496S and the triple-mutation S371L, S373P and S375F reduce binding by 2-fold and 2.2-fold respectively. E484A (instead of the Lys found other variants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) was neutral. While K417N (found in the Beta variant) on its own decreases binding substantially, the effect on binding when combined with other mutations is smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Two single-mutations found specifically in Omicron, Q493R and N440K did increase binding, probably due to increasing the electrostatic complementarity between ACE2 (negatively charged) and the RBD (positively charged) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P46">Comparing the RBD-62/ACE2 structure (PDB:7BH9) to that of Omicron RBD bound to Beta 55 antibody (described below, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), shows high similarity, with an RMSD of 0.55 Å over 139 residues. Importantly, the locations of the binding enhancing mutations 477N, 498R and 501Y are conserved between the two, despite the RBD-62 bound to ACE2, while Omicron RBD is not. This shows that these residues are pre-arranged for tight binding, implying low entropic penalty of binding.</p>

<title>The structural impact of the numerous mutations in S</title>
<p id="P48">To quickly gain insight into the possible structural impact of the numerous RBD mutations we used Alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) to predict the Omicron RBD structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). The top two ranked solutions, were essentially identical to each other and to the early pandemic reference structure (for residues 334 to 528 the RMSD for the 195 Ca atoms was 0.71 Å between the top ranked Alphafold2 prediction and the early pandemic structure). There was one region of significant, but still relatively minor, difference in the region of the triple serine mutation 371-375 (numbering for the early pandemic virus), on the right flank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). These mutations S371L, S373P, S375F all change from small flexible polar serine residues to bulkier, less flexible hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, all the Omicron S mutations involve single codon changes apart from S371L which requires two changes from TCC to CTC indicative of an underlying strong selection pressure and biological function to this change. The structure is not markedly altered however, it is exactly this region of the structure that undergoes a large conformation change when lipid is bound into the pocket. The serine rich loop opens, allowing the attached helix to swing out and open the pocket for lipid binding.</p>
<p id="P49">We suggest that increased rigidity and the entropic penalty of exposing hydrophobic residues may disfavour lipid binding to Omicron, which is likely to have an effect on the properties of the virus, explaining the selection of this apparently concerted series of changes.</p>
<p id="P50">To test these predictions, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the Omicron RBD domain in complex with two Fabs: Beta55 and EY6A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B, Table S2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). The RBD structure is very close to that observed in early pandemic viruses (RMSD 0.9 Å for 187 Ca) and, as predicted by Alphafold2 the only significant change in the vicinity of the set of 3 serine mutations at residues 371-375 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The rearrangement in this region is essentially an amplified version of that predicted, suggesting that algorithms such as Alphafold2 have some value in predicting the effect of dense patterns of mutations such as those seen in the Omicron RBD.</p>
<p id="P51">The binding of EY6A to the left flank of the RBD is essentially unchanged from that observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) (KD 7.8 and 6.8 nM for early pandemic and Omicron RBDs respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A, 7F</xref>), in line with this cryptic epitope, which is highly conserved for functional reasons, being a good target for broadly neutralising therapeutic antibodies.</p>
<p id="P52">Beta55, as predicted earlier(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>), binds to the right shoulder, around residue 501. Interestingly, the epitope includes several residues mutated in Omicron from the early pandemic virus (including Q498R, N501Y, Y505H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B, S6C</xref>). It is remarkable that despite these significant changes, neutralization is relatively little affected. The neutralisation result was confirmed by measurements of the binding affinity, 177 nM and 204 pM for the early pandemic and Omicron RBDs respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). To confirm the structural basis. we also determined the crystal structure of an analogous ternary complex formed with early pandemic RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), as expected the details of the interaction are essentially identical. If we extend the analysis of the 501Y targeting antibodies by comparing the structures of Beta-6, 24, 40 and 54, we find subtle explanations, thus Beta-24 and some others, are knocked out due to a clash with CDR-L1 created by the Q493R mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D</xref>), whereas for antibodies Beta-40, 54 and 55 this mutation can be accommodated. In addition, the Q498R mutation may create a hydrogen bond in Beta-40 or a salt bridge in Beta-54 to CDR-H3, which may compensate for the loss of binding affinity due to changes around residue 501 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>). Thus, the surprising resilience of several of the 501Y targeting antibodies may be because the mutated residues in this region are not ‘hot-spots’ of interaction and mutations can sometimes be accommodated without significant impact on affinity. This may suggest that a major driver for evolution was the less 501-focussed responses to early viruses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P53">The first 4 Omicron sequences were deposited on 24<sup>th</sup> November 2021. Within days distant international spread was seen and it is causing great concern due to its high transmissibility and ability to infect previously exposed or vaccinated individuals. Only three weeks after the virus was first detected in the UK Omicron cases outnumber Delta in London and the number of daily new cases in the UK is larger than at any previous time in the pandemic. Over the next weeks disease severity will become clearer.</p>
<p id="P54">The density of mutational changes (including deletions and insertions) found in Omicron S is extraordinary, being more than three times that observed in previous variants. Within S, as observed for other variants, the NTD, RBD and the furin cleavage site region are hotspots for mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>) and within the RBD, mutations are concentrated on the ACE2 interacting surface and the right flank. There seem to be two main drivers for the evolution of the RBD; increasing affinity to ACE2 and escape from the antibody response, which are coupled in Omicron.</p>
<p id="P55">Most potent neutralizing antibodies bind on, or in close proximity to the ACE2 footprint (neck and shoulder epitopes) and block interaction of S with ACE2, thereby preventing viral attachment to the host cell. There are two other classes of potent neutralizing mAbs, firstly antibodies binding in close proximity to the N343 glycan (right flank epitope) exemplified by Vir S309(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>) which include the Beta 49, 50 and 53 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>) used in our analysis. These mAbs bind distant from the ACE2 binding site, do not block ACE2 interaction and their mechanism of action may be to destabilize the S trimer. Finally, antibodies binding to the supersite on the NTD can also be potently neutralizing although the mechanism of action of NTD antibodies remains obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cerutti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>). Multiple mutations at all three of these sites: the receptor binding site, proximal to N343 glycan and NTD are found in Omicron, and lead to substantial reduction in neutralization titres for naturally immune or vaccine sera, with many showing complete failure of neutralization. This together with the widespread failure of potent mAb to neutralize Omicron point to a driver of immune evasion for their evolution.</p>
<p id="P56">The left flank epitope, which is not mutated in Omicron, in contrast is used by antibodies that do not block ACE2 binding, are not classed as potently neutralising in many assays and yet have been shown to be protective in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hastie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). This strongly conserved epitope is inaccessible in most conformations of the RBD and binding is proposed to destabilise the S trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Benton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Huo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that structural constraints on this epitope may render escape more problematic and this may therefore be an important target. Here we demonstrate structurally and by affinity measurements that the epitope is conserved and antibody binding essentially unchanged.</p>
<p id="P57">Following repeated rounds of selection by yeast display for high ACE2 affinity, RBD-62 (I358F, V445K, N460K, I468T, T470M, S477N, E484K, Q498R, N501Y) emerged as the highest affinity clone with a 1000-fold increase in affinity for ACE2 from 17 nM for Wuhan RBD to 16 pM for RBD-62. It is striking that the key contributors for the high affinity of RBD-62 are present in Omicron. Interestingly, the combination of mutations K417M, E484K, Q493R, Q498R and N501Y also emerged after 30 passages in mouse lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). This mouse-adapted virus was highly virulent and caused a more severe disease. The appearance of E484K, Q493H/R, Q498R and N501Y in yeast display and mouse adaptation experiments is a strong indication that the tighter binding to ACE2 also facilitates more efficient transmission.</p>
<p id="P58">However, in Omicron. the virus opts for a different strategy, affinity to ACE2 is not increased for Omicron-RBD. Since mutations S477N, Q498R and N501Y are likely to increase ACE2 affinity by 37-fold, we hypothesise that these changes, also found in RBD-62, serve to anchor the RBD to ACE2, leaving the rest of the receptor binding motif more freedom to develop further mutations, including those that reduce ACE2 affinity, in the quest to evade the neutralizing antibody response. Indeed, K417N, T478K, G496S, Y505H and the triple S371L, S373P, S375F reduce affinity to ACE2, while driving immune evasion. All this is achieved with very minimal structural changes in the isolated Omicron RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P59">These observations provide a valuable lesson on the plasticity of protein-protein binding sites, maintaining nM binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cohen-Khait and Schreiber, 2016</xref>). Thus, whilst the extreme concentration of potent neutralizing antibodies around the 25 amino acid receptor footprint of ACE2 suggest that this would be an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV-2, with ACE2 placing constraints on its variability (with receptor binding sites therefore sometimes hidden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rossmann et al., 1985</xref>)). In practice, the extraordinary plasticity of this site to absorb mutational change, whilst retaining affinity for ACE2 is a potent weapon to evade the antibody response. Such camouflage of receptor binding sites has been observed before (see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Acharya et al., 1989</xref>), but it seems that by acquiring a lock on the ACE2 receptor at one point, through 498 and associated mutations many other less energetically favorable changes can be tolerated, fueling antigenic escape. Thus, by mutating the receptor binding site, the virus can modulate ACE2 affinity and potentially transmissibility, whist at the same time evading the antibody response.</p>
<p id="P60">How Omicron evolved is currently under debate. The results presented here show that immune evasion is a primary driver in its evolution, sacrificing the affinity enhancing mutations for optimizing immune evading mutations. This could for instance happen by a combination of a single immunocompromised individual which further evolved in rural, unmonitored populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Clark et al., 2021</xref>). Virus evolution has been previously observed in chronically infected HIV+ individuals and other immunocompromised cases leading to the expression of the N501Y, E484K and K417T mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Karim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kemp et al., 2021</xref>). What seems beyond doubt from the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (only one synonymous mutation in all of S) is that the evolution has been driven by strong selective pressure on S. It has been predicted that increasing immunity by natural infection or vaccination will increase the selective pressure to find a susceptible host, either by increased transmissibility or antibody evasion, it appears that Omicron has achieved both of these goals.</p>
<p id="P61">In addition to changes in the ACE2 footprint Omicron RBD possesses a triplet of changes from serines to more bulky, hydrophobic residues, a motif not found in any of the other Sarbecoviruses. This introduces some structural changes and may led to loss of ability to form the lipid binding pocket which might normally aid release of the virus from infected cells. Since one of these mutations requires a double change in the codon it is likely that this effect is significant and it is conceivable that it acts in synergy with the change at residue 498, perhaps explaining why, even in the context of N501Y, present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma and other minor variants, this mutation has not established itself earlier.</p>
<p id="P62">For most mAbs the changes in interaction are so severe that activity is completely lost or severely impaired. This also extends to the set of mAbs developed for clinical use, the activity of most is lost, AZD8895 and ADG20 activity is substantially reduced while the activity of Vir S309 is more modestly reduced.</p>
<p id="P63">Omicron has now got a foothold in many countries, in the UK it has an estimated doubling time of 2.5 days, 2 doses of vaccine appear to give low protection from infection, while 3 doses give better protection. There is considerable concern that Omicron will rapidly replace</p>
<p id="P64">Delta and cause a large and sharp peak of infection in early 2022. It is likely that substantial increased transmissibility and immune evasion are contributing to the explosive rise in Omicron infections.</p>
<p id="P65">We have previously compared the neutralization of early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta using serum obtained early during the early pandemic or from Alpha, Beta or Gamma infected individuals. This allowed us to build a crude antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 sero-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>). Early pandemic viruses and Alpha sit close to the centre, whilst Beta/Gamma diverge in one direction and Delta in the opposite direction, meaning that Beta/Gamma serum poorly neutralize Delta and vice versa. Unsurprisingly, when we recalculate the map including Omicron data we find that Omicron occupies the most antigenically distant position on the map, being almost orthogonal to the plane containing the Beta, Gamma and Delta.</p>
<p id="P66">At present, the only option to control the spread of Omicron, barring social distancing and mask wearing, is to pursue vaccination with Wuhan containing antigen, to boost the response to sufficiently high titres to provide some protection. However, the antigenic distance of Omicron may mandate the development of vaccines against this strain. There will then be a question of how to use these vaccines; vaccination with Omicron will likely give good protection against Omicron, but will not give good protection against other strains. It seems possible therefore that Omicron may cause a shift from the current monovalent vaccines containing Wuhan S to multivalent vaccines containing an antigen such as Wuhan or Alpha at the centre of the antigenic map and Omicron or other S genes at the extreme peripheries of the map, similar to the polyvalent strategies used in influenza vaccines.</p>
<p id="P67">In summary, we have presented data showing that the huge number of mutational changes present in Omicron lead to a substantial knock down of neutralizing capacity of immune serum and failure of mAb. This appears to lead to a fall in vaccine effectiveness, but it is unlikely that vaccines will completely fail and it is hoped that although vaccine breakthroughs will occur, protection from severe disease will be maintained, perhaps by T cells. It is likely that the vaccine induced T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 will be less affected than the antibody response. Third dose vaccine boosters substantially raise neutralization titres to Omicron and are, in countries such as the UK, the mainstay of the response to Omicron. Widespread vaccine breakthrough may mandate the production of a vaccine tailored to Omicron and failure of monoclonal antibodies may likewise lead to the generation of second generation mAbs targeting Omicron.</p>
<p id="P68">A question asked after the appearance of each new variant is whether SARS-CoV-2 has reached its limit for evolution. Analysing the mutations in Omicron shows that, except for S371L, all other mutations required only single-nucleotide changes. Also, most changes observed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> RBD-62 evolution study constituted single-nucleotide mutations. Two-nucleotide mutations and epistatic mutations are more difficult to reach, but open up vast untapped potentials for future variants. To avoid this, it is imperative to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to reduce the number of infected people through vaccination and other measures globally.</p>
<sec id="S21">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p id="P69">The neutralization assays presented in this paper are performed <italic>in vitro</italic>, they do not therefore fully quantify the antibody response <italic>in vivo</italic> where complement and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity may contribute to virus control. Evasion of the antibody response may allow reinfection with Omicron, but the role of the T cell response, not measured here, is likely to contribute to the control of infection and moderate severe disease.</p>

<title>Focus Reduction Neutralization Assay (FRNT)</title>
<p id="P80">The neutralization potential of Ab was measured using a Focus Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT), where the reduction in the number of the infected foci is compared to a negative control well without antibody. Briefly, serially diluted Ab or plasma was mixed with SARS-CoV-2 strain Victoria or P.1 and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. The mixtures were then transferred to 96-well, cell culture-treated, flat-bottom microplates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers in duplicate and incubated for a further 2 hrs followed by the addition of 1.5% semi-solid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) overlay medium to each well to limit virus diffusion. A focus forming assay was then performed by staining Vero cells with human anti-NP mAb (mAb206) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (A0170; Sigma). Finally, the foci (infected cells) approximately 100 per well in the absence of antibodies, were visualized by adding TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate. Virus-infected cell foci were counted on the classic AID EliSpot reader using AID ELISpot software. The percentage of focus reduction was calculated and IC50 was determined using the probit program from the SPSS package.</p>

<title>Affinity driving mutations in Omicron RBD have previously been identified by in vitro evolution for tighter binding.</title>
<p>(A) Analysis of the occurrence and prevalence of Omicron variant mutations. The background is coloured according to S-protein functional domains: NTD domain (AA 12 – 306; orange), RBD domain (AA 318 – 514; green), Furin cleavage site and its proximity (AA 655 – 701; blue). The four positions critical for the high affinity of RBD-62 are highlighted in bold. Mutation frequencies within individual lineages are denoted in green (100-75 %), blue (75-50 %) and magenta (50-25 %). Information about the distribution and frequency of S-protein mutations and the spatiotemporal characterization of SARS-CoV-2 lineages was retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.outbreak.info">www.outbreak.info</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mullen et al., 2020</xref>) and Gisaid database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017).* Same evolutionary origin, a Number of evolutionary non-related lineages with given or similar mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zahradnik et al., 2021c</xref>), b log(10) number of the observed Omicron mutation at the given position as determined on 14.11.2021, c same as b but total log(10) number of changes at the given position. d fold-change in binding as determined by yeast-surface display. (B) Comparison of fold change in binding affinity among selected mutations and their combinations as determined by titrating ACE2 on yeast surface displayed RBD mutations. Values are fold-change relative to the original strain. For Omicron, yeast titration is denoted in violet, SPR (this study) is black, SPR as determined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cameroni et al., 2021</xref>) is grey and ELISA as determined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Schubert et al., 2021</xref>) is in orange. Data denoted by black dots have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zahradnik et al., 2021b</xref>). (C) RBD-62 (blue)/ACE2 (green) structure (PDB: 7BH9) overlaid on Omicron RBD structure (orange) as determined bound to Beta 55. All Omicron mutations are shown, overlaid on relevant RBD-62 mutations.

<title>Antigenic map from neutralization data for omicron.</title>
<p>(A) neutralization data (log titres) showing sera as columns against challenge variants as rows. Sera are grouped into blocks according to the eliciting variant. The reference neutralization titre for each block is calculated as the average of all self-challenge titres, i.e. when challenged with the same variant as which elicited the serum. In the case of vaccine sera this was taken as the average of all best neutralisation titres. Colours within a single block therefore express the relative neutralization titre with respect to this reference. (B) shows an example of the equivalent model generated from one run of antigenic map refinement using the same reference offsets as calculated for (A). (C) shows three-dimensional view of the antigenic map for variants of concern. The distance between two points corresponds to the drop-off in neutralisation titre used to generate value for (B). (D) same antigenic space as (C), but rotated to look down from the point of view of the Omicron position on the remaining variants. (E) Overlay of the X-ray structure of Omicron (red) on the early pandemic (Wuhan) RBD (grey) and the predicted model of the Omicron RBD in black, drawn as cartoons. The structural change effected by the S371L, S373P and S375F mutations is shown enlarged see inset. (F) X-ray structure of ternary complex of Omicron RBD with Beta 55 and EY6A Fabs. The Omicron RBD is shown as a grey semi-transparent surface with the mutated residues in magenta. The Fabs are drawn as cartoons, heavy chain in magenta and light chain in blue.</p>
