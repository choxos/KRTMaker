<title>Background</title>
<p id="P1">Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in critically ill patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. Cellular mechanisms underlying AKI and kidney cell responses to injury remain incompletely understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P2">We performed single-nuclei transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, molecular imaging studies, and conventional histology on kidney tissues from 8 individuals with severe AKI (stage 2 or 3 according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria). Specimens were obtained within 1-2 hours after individuals had succumbed to critical illness associated with respiratory infections, with 4 of 8 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Control kidney tissues were obtained post-mortem or after nephrectomy from individuals without AKI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">High-depth single cell-resolved gene expression data of human kidneys affected by AKI revealed enrichment of novel injury-associated cell states within the major cell types of the tubular epithelium, in particular in proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules. Four distinct, hierarchically interconnected injured cell states were distinguishable and characterized by transcriptome patterns associated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, interferon response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively. Transcriptome differences between individuals with AKI were driven primarily by the cell type-specific abundance of these four injury subtypes rather than by private molecular responses. AKI-associated changes in gene expression between individuals with and without COVID-19 were similar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="P4">The study provides an extensive resource of the cell type-specific transcriptomic responses associated with critical illness-associated AKI in humans, highlighting recurrent disease-associated signatures and inter-individual heterogeneity. Personalized molecular disease assessment in human AKI may foster the development of tailored therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P5">Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequently observed clinical syndrome, which associates with high morbidity and mortality<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. More than 10% of all hospitalized individuals and more than 50% of critically ill individuals admitted to intensive care units develop AKI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Despite its extensive clinical and economic impact, AKI therapy is largely limited to best supportive care and kidney replacement therapies (hemodialysis or hemofiltration) in patients with advanced kidney failure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Targeted therapies preventing AKI or fostering recovery from AKI are still missing.</p>
<p id="P6">Numerous attempts have been made using animal models and human samples to uncover underlying mechanisms of AKI, to identify therapeutic targets and to identify disease biomarkers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. However, studies in a controlled clinical setting with cell type-specific gene expression resolution of human AKI are lacking.</p>
<p id="P7">Although AKI is uniformly defined by changes in serum creatinine levels and/or urinary output, previous studies suggest a vast underlying heterogeneity and complexity of AKI with an unknown number of AKI subtypes, suggesting that personalized approaches in the treatment of AKI may be needed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Most recently, the question of AKI subtypes was intensively debated when high incidence rates of AKI were observed in individuals with COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. In particular the question was raised whether COVID-19 entails a specific molecular subtype of AKI, either through renal viral tropism or other systemic effects<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">Single-cell gene expression approaches provide powerful tools to investigate cell type-specific changes and cellular interactions and thus may help to delineate potential molecular subtypes of AKI. Recent mouse studies underlined the potential of single cell resolution for our understanding of AKI and revealed new molecular cell states associated with AKI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>

<title>Single-nuclei RNA sequencing from human kidney samples enables the investigation of cell type-specific gene expression changes in acute kidney injury</title>
<p id="P9">To access cellular responses in AKI, we conducted a single cell transcriptome census of human AKI utilizing single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of kidney samples from individuals with AKI and control individuals without AKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Kidney samples from individuals with AKI who succumbed to critical illness were obtained within 1-2 hours post-mortem with consent of next of kin. All AKI individuals (n=8, AKI<sub>1-8</sub>) had developed clinical criteria of severe AKI (as defined by KDIGO criteria for AKI stage 2 or stage 3) within 5 days prior to sampling. All individuals had developed AKI in a clinical setting of critical illness, severe respiratory infections, and systemic inflammation, including four cases of COVID-19-associated AKI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>). To control for baseline characteristics inherent to human kidneys obtained under clinical conditions and to quantitate the extent of post-mortem effects on gene expression, we used control kidney samples. They included normal kidney tissue collected during tumor nephrectomies (n=3; Control<sub>TN1-TN3</sub>; for clinical parameters of all individuals see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>). In addition, we obtained post-mortem kidney tissue at three different time points (15 min, 60 min, 120 min) after the cessation of circulation (Control<sub>15 min; 60 min; 120 min</sub>) from a brain-dead individual without clinical evidence of AKI.</p>
<p id="P10">Single-nuclei RNA-seq of all samples resulted in 106,971 sequenced cells with a median of 2139 detected genes and 4008 unique transcripts per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S1</xref>). Joint unbiased clustering and cell type identification with known marker genes allowed the identification of the expected major kidney cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). There were no overt differences in major cell type abundances between AKI and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the presence of AKI (versus absence of clinical AKI) was the main driver of cell type-specific and global gene expression differences between the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, PCA did not identify a major impact of the sampling method (tumor versus post-mortem biopsy), the sampling time after cessation of circulation (15 min, 60 min or 120 min) or the presence of COVID-19-associated AKI (versus AKI associated with other respiratory infections) on global or cell-type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig S2</xref>). Interestingly, we observed heterogeneity of kidney cell gene expression between different individuals with AKI, suggesting different molecular subtypes of AKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Kidney tubular epithelial cells from different parts of the nephron show strong gene expression responses to AKI</title>
<p id="P11">Kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice, the most frequently applied experimental model of human AKI, results in a predominant injury of cells of the proximal tubule (PT), the most abundant cell type of the kidney. Therefore, many previous studies focused on this cell type<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. However, in humans there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of AKI on molecular states of different kidney cell types<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. To assess the cell type-specific response to AKI systematically, we performed differential gene expression analysis within the major kidney cell types comparing AKI to control kidneys using DESeq2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table S2</xref> for a full list of differentially expressed genes per cell type). Profound transcriptomic responses to AKI were observed in kidney tubule cells of the PT, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and connecting tubules (CNT), cell types that reside predominantly in the cortex and outer medulla of the kidney, regions that are known to be particular susceptible to ischemic or hypoxic injury<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, less pronounced transcriptomic responses to AKI were observed in thin limbs (tL), collecting duct principal cells (CD-PCs) and collecting duct intercalated cells (CD-ICs), consistent with the predominant localization of these cell types in the inner medulla of the kidney, which is adapted to a low oxygen environment, has lower energy expenditure and is less susceptible to hypoxia or ischemia when compared to more cortical regions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Podocytes, endothelial cells and interstitial cells also displayed less pronounced transcriptomic responses in AKI.</p>
<p id="P12">Among differentially expressed genes were known markers of renal cell stress, which encode proteins that have been proposed as kidney injury markers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/lipocalin 2 (LCN2), kidney injury molecule 1 (HAVCR1), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, our data provided the opportunity to identify the major cellular sources where these transcripts were synthesized in response to injury. For instance, consistent with previous reports on mouse and human AKI, LCN2 was primarily upregulated in CNT and CD-PC<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, while HAVCR1 was primarily upregulated in PT<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), encoding for the secreted glycoprotein osteopontin, was found to be upregulated in virtually all non-leukocyte kidney cell types. This was strongly reminiscent of the situation in mouse AKI, where osteopontin upregulation was similarly observed in multiple kidney cell types<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, and where osteopontin inhibition attenuated renal injury<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>, suggesting a conserved, targetable AKI pathway. IGFBP7 protein was previously found to be primarily of PT origin in diseased human kidneys<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Consistently, we found an upregulation of IGFBP7 mRNA in PT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, we also found IGFBP7 to be upregulated in podocytes and TALs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), findings which we were able to validate by IGFBP7 in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>). This indicates that our single cell transcriptome database is consistent with prior knowledge and provides an opportunity to uncover novel information regarding the cellular origin of AKI-associated transcripts.</p>
<p id="P13">Pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes indicated that a proportion of genes upregulated in AKI were associated with inflammatory response-associated pathways (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma and interleukin signaling), hypoxia response, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Table S3</xref>). Importantly, our analyses indicated that most functional pathways were upregulated simultaneously in multiple kidney tubule cell types suggesting common AKI response patterns across the nephron. Several studies have indicated an AKI-associated metabolic shift in tubular epithelia and a downregulation of genes associated with tubular transport processes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Consistently, we observed that genes downregulated in AKI were mostly related to molecule transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Since our cohort included four individuals with COVID-19-associated AKI, we compared their kidney cell type-specific gene expression with that of individuals with non-COVID-19 respiratory infection-associated AKI. Only few differentially expressed genes were identified, suggesting that the major transcriptomic responses of kidney cells in COVID-19 were not substantially different from those in other forms of AKI (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl. Table S4</xref> for the respective gene lists).</p>
<p id="P15">Importantly, the genes and pathways that were differentially regulated in AKI versus control according to single nuclei sequencing data displayed concordant regulation in bulk mRNA sequencing from separate kidney samples of the same patients, providing additional validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C, D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S9">
<title>Profound effects of AKI on kidney cell state abundance</title>
<p id="P16">To achieve a more fine-grained analysis of cellular subclasses, we performed subclusterings of the major kidney cell types. Thereby, we were able to derive 74 kidney cell populations based on their transcriptomes, which included known cellular subtypes of kidney cells (e. g. S1, S2, and S3 segments of the PT) and additional novel cell populations (designated as “New” cell populations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S4-5</xref>). These “New” cell populations were still attributable to major kidney cell types based on their transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), but they were not characteristic of the known anatomic sub cell types, suggesting that they represent injury-related cell states.</p>
<p id="P17">We analyzed, which of the identified cell subpopulations differed in abundance in individuals with AKI, yielding depleted and enriched subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Profound depletion in AKI was observed within cells of the PT (in particular those representing the S3 segment), consistent with its known susceptibility to injury and its tendency to undergo dedifferentiation in AKI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Unexpectedly, in addition to PT, differentiated medullary TAL, DCT, CNT cells were also substantially depleted in AKI. Inversely, profound enrichment in AKI was observed of the “New” cell subpopulations associated with these same cell types, indicating that PT, TAL, DCT and CNT displayed the most profound responses to AKI and confirming the notion that “New” subpopulations represent injury-associated cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). “New” subpopulations within cells of collecting duct (CD-PC, CD-IC-A, CD-IC-B), ascending and descending thin limbs (ATL, DTL) were also enriched in AKI, although they represented only small subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that these cell types are less susceptible or reside in less susceptible regions of the kidney. Non-epithelial cell types of the kidney, such as endothelial cells, interstitial cells and leukocytes displayed no enrichment or depletion in AKI, with the exception of one subtype of endothelial cells (EC-New 1), which was enriched in AKI and showed a transcriptional profile resembling endothelia of descending vasa recta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S10">
<title>Analyses of AKI-induced cell states suggest four distinct injury response patterns</title>
<p id="P18">We next conducted further analyses to characterize the “New” cell subpopulations detected within the tubular epithelial compartment of the kidney. Quantification of the four “New” cell clusters associated with the PT (PT-New 1-4) indicated that almost one third (31.8%) of PT cells in AKI samples belonged to these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We next identified marker genes for PT-New 1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and performed pathway analysis. Enriched gene sets included oxidative stress signaling and the nuclear transcription factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway (PT-New 1), the hypoxia response pathway (PT-New 2), the interferon gamma response and genes encoding for ribosomal proteins (PT-New 3) as well as genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PT-New 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org</ext-link>, Hallmark and canonical pathways, for pathway definitions). Nevertheless, PT-New 1-4 showed some overlap and trajectory analysis using partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup> suggested hierarchical relationships between healthy PT cells and cells representing PT-New 1-4, with PT-New 4 displaying the most distant gene expression signature from healthy PT.</p>
<p id="P19">We compared PT-New 1-4 to previously identified PT-derived injured cell states in mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, designated as “injured PT S1/S2 cells”, “injured PT S3 cells”, “severe injured PT cells” and “failed repair” cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. We trained a multinomial model using marker genes of these clusters using a cross-species mouse/human comparative approach (see methods), which indicated that PT-New 1 (oxidative stress) showed similarity to injured mouse S1/2 cells, whereas PT-New 2 (hypoxia) resembled injured S3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S6</xref>). PT-New 3 and PT-New 4 most closely resembled “failed repair” PT cells in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S6</xref>). Cells from PT-New 3 and PT-New 4 expressed the EMT marker VIM. PT-New 4 cells were additionally marked by VCAM1, a marker that has previously been associated with the “failed repair” state of injured PT cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. PT-New 1, PT-New 3 and PT-New 4 also showed high expression of interferon target genes (e. g. IFITM2, IFITM3) and human leukocyte antigen HLA-A, which is consistent with the association of injured PT cells with immune responses and inflammation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Together these observations suggest that “New” cell populations represent four distinct but hierarchically connected injured PT cell states.</p>
<p id="P20">The individual abundances of PT-New 1-4 and the combined abundances of PT-New 1-4 were significantly increased in the AKI samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Importantly, the distribution of PT-New 1-4 among individuals with AKI displayed marked heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, E</xref>). For instance, the relative abundance of PT-New 4 (EMT/ “failed repair”) varied by a factor of three among samples from different individuals with AKI (compare PT-New 4 between AKI 4 and AKI 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The combined injury-associated PT clusters (PT-New 1-4) made up between 20% and 45% of all proximal tubule cells in individuals with AKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Together these observations highlight the presence of recurrent AKI-associated cell states, but they also indicate substantial inter-individual heterogeneity.</p>
<p id="P21">To localize “New” PT-associated clusters in injured kidney tissues, we performed RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations for transcripts overexpressed in PT-New 1-4 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Interleukin-18 (IL18) mRNA was specifically expressed in occasional cells within clusters PT-New 2 and PT-New 4. Consistently, in situ hybridizations indicated that IL18 mRNA was expressed in a small subpopulation of PT cells of AKI kidneys compared with little or no expression in control kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). In contrast, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) was widely expressed in PT-New 1-4 cells. Consistently, in situ hybridizations of AKI kidneys demonstrated IGFBP7 mRNA expression in a substantial subset of PT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), while only few PT cells of control kidneys expressed IGFBP7. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was expressed in a subset of cells within PT-New 1, 3, and 4. In situ hybridization confirmed IFITM3 expression within severely injured PT cells of AKI kidneys, while IFITM3 was undetectable in control kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>The abundance of injury response patterns varies among cell types of the kidney tubule</title>
<p id="P22">We next turned to other kidney epithelial cell types and their response to injury. We compared AKI-enriched “New” cell states in tL, TAL, DCT, CNT, CD-PC and CD-IC to those in PT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S7-9</xref>). Remarkably, the transcriptomic responses of the different tubular epithelial cell types to AKI displayed a marked overlap. For instance, “New” cell populations residing in TAL (TAL-New 1-4) and DCT (DCT-New 1-4) displayed 4 injured cell states with marker genes and functional pathways similar to PT-New 1-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Table S5</xref>). This suggests conserved injury responses across different kidney cell types. The percentage of cells displaying AKI-associated “New” cell states varied markedly among major cell types of the kidney: 31.8% of PT cells; 36.4% of TAL cells; 59.6% of DCT cells; 43.5% of CNT cells; 2.1% of tL cells; 19.1% of CD-PCs and 5.7% of CD-ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S7-9</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Similar to the PT, we also observed inter-individual heterogeneity for the AKI-associated cell states in other cell types of the kidney tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl. Fig. S7-9</xref>). Although, similar clusters as PT-New 1-4 were present in the other kidney tubule cell types, their relative abundance was cell type-dependent. In PTs and DCTs, the most abundant AKI-associated cell state was that associated with EMT (PT-New 4 and DCT-New 4). In contrast, the most abundant TAL cell state was TAL-New 3 (interferon gamma signaling-associated). IFITM3, an interferon-associated gene and marker gene of TAL-New 3, was expressed in injured TALs of AKI kidneys when analyzed by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). We conclude that injury responses in different epithelial cell types of the kidney associate with common molecular pathways and marker genes, although they display cell type-specific and inter-individual heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">This study identifies a strong impact of human AKI associated with critical illness on the kidney transcriptome at single cell resolution. We provide an atlas of single cell transcriptomes and uncover novel AKI-induced transcriptomic responses at unprecedented cellular resolution and transcriptional depth. We find that the dominant AKI-associated transcriptomic alterations reside within the different cell types of the kidney’s tubular epithelium with surprisingly few transcriptomic alterations in other cell types. We uncover four AKI-associated “New” transcriptomic cell states, which emerge abundantly in PT, TAL and DCT and display a remarkable overlap of marker genes and enriched molecular pathways between these different tubular epithelial cell types, suggesting common injury mechanisms. Finally, we report a strong transcriptional heterogeneity among individuals with AKI, which is explained by the inter-individual differences in cell type-specific abundances of injury-associated cell states.</p>
<p id="P25">Our study provides insights into the pathophysiology of human AKI and indicates injury-associated responses in several different types of tubular epithelial cells. Previous studies of AKI in animal models (mostly ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice) have focused on the PT because cells of the PT are abundant and because PTs display marked susceptibility and responsiveness to ischemic injury<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Fewer studies have examined effects of AKI on other cell types. However, some previous rodent studies also showed evidence of injury in distal parts of the kidney tubule including TALs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup> and collecting ducts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>, similar to what we demonstrate here in human AKI. Presumed mechanisms of tubular injury and tubular transcriptome responses are related to the high metabolic demands of tubular cells, in particular proximal tubules and TALs, which become overwhelmed in the setting of ischemia or hypoxia <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. Tubular stress in this setting is documented by novel induction of injury-associated transcripts and down-regulation of differentiation markers (e. g. solute transporters). Most recently, transcriptome studies at single cell resolution in mouse AKI models confirmed these findings and indicated predominant cellular responses in the proximal tubule compartment of the kidney<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Our human AKI data are consistent with the proximal tubular responses described in mice, but they suggest an unexpectedly widespread molecular response in other types of kidney tubular epithelia, including TAL, DCT, CNT and collecting duct. It is tempting to assume that this difference reflects the more complex, multifactorial pathogenesis of AKI in critically ill patients compared to ischemia reperfusion models, but additional interspecies differences can so far not be excluded.</p>
<p id="P26">Given the observed induction of AKI-associated cell states in different segments of the kidney tubule, questions arise regarding their functional significance. It is noteworthy that we found a particularly pronounced activation of NRF2 target genes in the “New 1” clusters in several cell types (PT-New 1, TAL-New 1, DCT-New 1, CNT-New 1, CD-PC-New 1, TL-New 1). NRF2 signaling is induced by oxidative stress, plays a role in the induction of antioxidative genes and has been associated with protection from kidney injury<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. Trajectory analyses and comparative genomics indicated that these cells were likely derived from S1/2 segments of the PT and represent an early stage of injury. Cells of the “New 2” cluster exhibited a hypoxia signature. Hypoxia has also previously been recognized as an important mechanism of AKI, due to low baseline tissue oxygen concentrations in the kidney, which further decline under conditions leading to AKI. Induction of hypoxia-inducible genes through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors in different kidney cell populations or selectively in TAL or PT cells was found to ameliorate ischemic or toxic AKI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, cells of the “New 3” and “New 4” clusters expressed an EMT signature and pro-inflammatory genes and resembled cells previously described as a “failed repair” state, which is associated with progression to kidney fibrosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. In trajectory analyses these cells were transcriptionally most distant from healthy tubular epithelium in PT and TAL.</p>
<p id="P27">Our study included patients with COVID-19-associated AKI. There is an ongoing debate on the mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19, particularly with regard to whether there is a COVID-19-specific kidney pathophysiology that is different from other critical illness-associated forms of AKI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Our study did not uncover a specific transcriptomic signature associated with COVID-19-associated AKI and suggests that COVID-19 AKI is on a common molecular spectrum with AKI associated with other types of respiratory failure and critical illness.</p>
<p id="P28">In summary, we observed that AKI in humans with critical illness and systemic inflammation is associated with widespread transcriptomic responses within a spectrum of kidney cell types, uncovering novel cell states and potential targets for AKI therapies. These findings suggest that precision approaches like single cell transcriptomics maybe suitable tools to overcome the current limitations in diagnosing and treating subtypes of AKI.</p>

<p id="P33">Initial filtering was performed by excluding nuclei with more than 5% mitochondrial reads and less than 500 detected genes. Nuclei passing this filter of all samples were then analyzed using Seurat’s best practice work flow for data integration using the reciprocal PCA approach (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satiialab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html">https://satiialab.org/seurat/articles/integration_rpca.html</ext-link>) with default parameters. Emerging clusters were then analyzed for marker gene expression using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function and subsequently assigned to the major renal cell types.

<p id="P34">During the next steps, the aim was to identify destroyed nuclei and doublets. For the destroyed nuclei, in the initial clustering, they clearly clustered away from major kidney cell types and showed a significantly reduced complexity of gene expression (nUMI, nGene) when compared to major cell types. Doublets could be detected by clusters in the subclusterings of the major cell types showing canonical marker genes from another major cell type (e.g. TAL marker gene expression in a PT subcluster). Destroyed and doublet cells were removed and the whole clustering process was repeated to avoid any influence of the excluded cells on the clusterings.</p>
<p id="P35">Enrichment testing for all major cell types was performed by calculating relative abundances of each generated subcluster per patient as percent of the respective major cell type. A p-value was computed by using a Mann-Whitney-U test comparing relative abundances of AKI samples versus control samples for each cluster and each major cell type. Enrichment scores were calculated by -log10 transforming the p-values and considered significant if p-value&lt;0.05.
