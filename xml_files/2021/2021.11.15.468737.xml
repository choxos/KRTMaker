The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex for genome replication and transcription, making RdRp an appealing target for antiviral drug development. Here, we reveal that RdRp can recognize and utilize nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) as a substrate to synthesize RNAs with an efficiency of about two thirds of using nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as a substrate. NDPs incorporation is also template-specific and has high fidelity. Moreover, RdRp can incorporate β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) into RNA while using diphosphate form molnupiravir (MDP) as a substrate.

Replication of the genome and transcription of genes are all dependent on a protein complex known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 contains a catalytic subunit (non-structural protein 12, nsp12) and two accessory subunits (nsp7 and nsp8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

Due to the significant role of RdRp and the lack of homologues in humans, RdRp has become the most appealing target for anti-coronavirus drug development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To date, the most promising RdRp inhibitors are nucleotide/nucleoside analogs (NA). NA prodrugs are designed to be metabolized to the active 5'-triphosphate form (5'-TP)once inside cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, thus they can compete with endogenous nucleotides for incorporation into newly synthesized viral RNAs, resulting in viral genomes lethal mutation or inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Remdesivir is a broad antiviral drug approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, which can be incorporated into RNA to sterically hinder RdRp, thereby blocking viral RNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Other NAs (favipiravir, ribavirin) are integrated into nascent viral RNA at high rates but are not recognized as endogenous nucleotides in subsequent rounds of replication, increasing the mutation rate and resulting in an inviable genome, a process known as "lethal mutagenesis"<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

To develop a better RdRp targeting drug we need to better understanding of both the properties of RdRp and how these inhibitors function.

Although both dNDPs and NDPs showed very weak activity in these experiments, the data prompted us to test if NDPs are an active substrate for RdRp. In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can recognize and utilize NDPs as a substrate to synthesize RNAs with an efficiency of about two thirds of using nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as a substrate. In addition,we proved that molnupiravir is not only fully functionable in its diphosphate form but also more active than in triphosphate form. This could imply a new strategy for designing COVID-19 treatment nucleoside analogue drugs with more efficacy and fewer side effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RdRp synthesizes RNA by using both NTPs and NDPs as a substrate</title><p id="P6">Since RdRp is by far one of the most attractive targets for anti-coronavirus drug development, a thorough characterization of RdRp polymerase activity will, without doubt, greatly contribute to discovering the effective strategy for drug screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 was purified by assembling nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). Based on previous research, SARS-CoV-2 RdRp polymerase activity was measured by conducting a conventional RNA elongation assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. When NTPs was added, elongation catalyzed by RdRp complex occurred on the RNA duplex, resulting in an intact double-stranded RNA product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To test if RdRp uses NDPs or NMPs as a substrate, we performed an RNA extension assay by using NTPs, NDPs or NMPs as substrate, respectively. The result revealed that RdRp synthesized RNA products of the same length regardless of NTPs or NDPs as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>). To examine the template specificity of this RNA synthesis, we challenged 13+23 nt RNA with various NDPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). Only the cognate ADP promoted RNA extension, indicating that NDPs incorporation is template-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This result also raised the question of whether the RNA made from NDPs has the right sequence. Hence, two experiments were performed: single-clonal sequencing of ligated plasmids, and high-throughput sequencing of PCR products. First, the cDNA was synthesized through reverse transcription of the RNA products, and then amplified by 10 cycles of PCR with primers containing the restriction sites of XhoI and BamHI. PCR products were then ligated into the vector pET-15b and used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α strain. Plasmids extracted from the positive clones were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The sequencing results indicated that the RNA synthesized from NDPs has the right sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f</xref>). Second, the cDNA amplified by 10 cycles of PCR was sequenced by high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>). At least 50,000 sequences were obtained for each product (SI). The ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP (purchased from Sigma) used in these experiments were characterized by mass spectrometry respectively to make sure these NDPs were not contaminated by NTPs (S1).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NDPs are nearly two thirds as efficient as NTPs as a substrate of RdRp</title><p id="P9">Previous studies indicated that although some DNA polymerases and RNA polymerases are able to use diphosphate form substrate. The activity of the diphosphate form substrate, however, is much lower than that of the triphosphate form substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To determine if this is also the case for RdRp we performed a kinetics study by using NTPs and NDPs as a substrate respectively. The 13+23 nt RNA duplex was used as a template and the elongation of product over time was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). Kinetics curves indicated that the relative incorporation efficiency of NDPs is about two thirds (67.94% ± 2.66%) of that of NTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>). These data suggested that the incorporation rate for NDPs is slower than that of NTPs. Subsequently, we decided to test if all four NDPs equally contribute to the slower incorporation rate. A 13+26 nt RNA duplex was synthesized for the assay testing the incorporation efficiency for each NDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>). Each reaction system contains three NTPs and the NDP of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). Unexpectedly, our data showed that substitution of any single NTP by NDP has no observable effect on the efficiency of RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>). This may imply that the speed of RNA synthesis is only affected by continuous NDP incorporation but not the intermittent insertion.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SARS-CoV-2 RdRp incorporates NHC into RNA by using diphosphate form molnupiravir as a substrate</title><p id="P10">Since RdRp has become one of the most important targets for the development of antiviral drugs, many nucleoside analogue drugs have been constructed to target RdRp for COVID-19 treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Among all these chemicals reported by far, molnupiravir has been regarded as a promising drug candidate. The molecular mechanism of molnupiravir was determined recently. Once ingested by patients, molnupiravir undergoes stepwise phosphorylation to yield the active nucleoside triphosphate analogue (β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, or MTP). The RdRp then uses MTP as substrate and incorporates NHC monophosphate into RNA at the position where the nucleotide in the template is G or A, resulting in “error catastrophe” and virus death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Although the mechanism of molnupiravir has been well established, our finding of-RdRp’s ability to utilize NDPs as a substrate still raises a question: is NHC diphosphate (MDP) also an active form and recognized by RdRp as a substrate? To address this question, the 13+26 nt RNA duplex was used to perform the RNA extension assay with NDPs and MDP as the substrates in comparison with the extension using NTPs and MTP as the substrates. The 13+26 nt RNA duplex allows ten nucleotides (nt) of extension. The 13+26 nt RNA duplex contanis two adjacent G and two adjacent A, allowing NHC incorporation into the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>). In this case, when cytidine triphosphate (CTP) or uridine triphosphate (UTP) is replaced by MDP, the incorporation of M does not hinder the incorporation of the next subsequent nucleotide, and RdRp still completes the extension reaction. Similar results were obtained using MTP as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that both MTP and MDP are active forms of monulpiravir in humans.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MDP is a better substrate than MTP</title><p id="P12">Since both MTP and MDP are active substrates of RdRp we performed an assay to figure out which one is the better substrate. By observing their efficiency in reaction, we found that when the template is G, the relative incorporation efficiency of MTP is 0.78, while MDP is 0.87 in comparison to CTP. When the template is A, the relative incorporation efficiency of MTP is 0.58, while MDP is 0.77 in comparison to UTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3d</xref>). In order to obtain a reliable result, the experiment was repeated six times with two batches of RdRp. The results indicated MDP is the better substrate for RdRp in comparison to MTP. MTP and MDP were characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry to make sure they are the right pure compounds (S2).</p><p id="P13">Next, we tried to determine if MDP is also more efficient in introducing mutations than MTP. The products of RdRp-catalyzed extension reactions containing MTP or MDP using 13+29 nt RNA as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>) were reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified, and the number of mutations was counted by high-throughput sequencing. The statistical results were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Similar mutation ratios were found when the same concentrations of MTP and MDP were added. Higher ratio of MTP or MDP to CTP associates with higher mutation rate, with MDP resulting in slightly more mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>NDPs are a good substrate for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp but not other virus RNA polymerases</title><p id="P14">To test if other virus RNA polymerases also use NDPs as a substrate, we purified SARS-CoV RdRp, NS5 protein of ZIKA virus and T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and measured their activities when NDPs were used as s substrate. Results show that amount these RNA polymerases tested SARS-CoV-2 RdRp had the highest activity when using NDPs as a substrate. SARS-CoV RdRp could also use NDPs as a substrate, but the product band seam a double RNA strand shorter than expectation implying stalled extension. NS5 of ZIKA virus did not produce a well-defined product band when using NDPs as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>). The transcription of T7 RNAP was measured based on fluorescence technology. We found that except for the case in which ATP was replaced by ADP and weak transcription occurred, any other NTP replaced by NDP would inhibit the transcription completely.

Thoroughly characterization of RdRp both structurally and biochemically would no doubt be beneficial to drug development.</p><p id="P17">The substrate usage of RdRp is astonishing. To the best of our knowledge, most RNA polymerases, including DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, use nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as a substrate to synthesize RNA under the guidance of a template strand. We found that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp synthesizes RNA with comparable efficiency using NTPs and NDPs as a substrate, and other RNA viruses that can utilize NDPs as a substrate have also been found. We speculate that the ability to use NDPs as a substrate may be an advantage of RNA virus during infection. During later stages of infection, host cells may not be able to produce enough ATP and other NTPs. By using NDPs as a substrate, SARS-CoV-2 can continue the process of genome replication and assembly of progeny viruses, while most metabolic activities stop.</p><p id="P18">It has long been a general knowledge that to become active against virus nucleoside analogue drugs must undergo stepwise addition of phosphate groups to become the triphosphate form. In order to produce this outcome, this type of antivirals must be recognized by three kinds of kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This raises a concern that the triphosphate form of antivirals may be incorporated into host mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Even worse, mutagenic ribonucleoside analogs could be reduced into the 2’-deoxyribonucleotide form by host ribonucleotide reductase and then incorporated into DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our finding that RdRp also uses MDP as a substrate could largely resolve these concerns. Since the diphosphate form is also active, there would be no issue regarding whether the prodrugs can become triphosphate form inside host cells. Furthermore, nucleoside diphosphate analogues, which can evade nucleoside diphosphate kinase, would cease to have the possibility of being incorporated into mRNA or DNA. The best strategy is to use the membrane-permeable nucleotide diphosphate analog for COVID-19 treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The advantage of this strategy is that the drug is not only able to bypass all the phosphorylation steps and has no risk of incorporation into host mRNA or DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P19">Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, composed of nsp12, nsp7 and two copied of the nsp8 subunits, was carried out as described in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

RdRp catalyzed reactions each containing three NTPs and one NDP (ADP GTP CTP UTP, ATP GDP CTP UTP, ATP GTP CDP UTP and ATP GTP CTP UDP) and 13+26 nt RNA duplex was performed for 1 min. The reactions were stopped with 2 × stop buffer. Grayscale analysis was then carried out using ImageJ and ilustrated by using OriginPro 8 (OriginLab, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>RNA extension assays with MDP as substrate</title><p id="P28">A 13+26 nt RNA duplex was used in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5e</xref>). The 5' end of the RNA product strand was labeled with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) group, which allows us to monitor RNA elongation. RdRp can incorporate NHC monophosphate into RNA at the position where the nucleotide in the template is G or A. MDP and MTP were purchased from MedChemExpress.</p><p id="P29">For RNA extension RdRp at final concentration of 2 μM was incubated with 200 nM 13+26 nt RNA duplex and 50 μM ATP GTP UTP or CTP GTP UTP with or without 50 μM MTP/MDP in 20 μl reaction buffer for 1min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped with 2 × stop buffer. 10 μl RNA product for each reaction was resolved on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels and imaged with a Tanon-5200 Multi Fluorescence Imager to confirm the extension.

Fluorescent signal continuously changed when transcription occurred, indicating the presence of RNA product. However, when NDPs were used as a substrate, the fluorescent signal remained unchanged, indicating the lack of RNA product. Substitution of ATP by ADP led to weak transcription, any other NTP replaced by NDP would inhibit the transcription completely.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS139960-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig.5</label><caption><p>Nucleotide diphosphate analog prodrugs designed by our strategy would have less potential to cause side effects.
