severe respiratory illness in humans. Dromedary camels are the zoonotic reservoir for MERS-CoV. To investigate the biology of MERS-CoV in camelids, we developed a well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model for <italic>Llama glama</italic> and <italic>Camelus bactrianus</italic>. Histological characterization revealed progressive epithelial cellular differentiation with well-resemblance to autologous <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissues. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV displays a divergent cell tropism and replication kinetics profile in both AEC models. Furthermore, we observed that in the camelid AEC models MERS-CoV replication can be inhibited by both type I and III interferons (IFNs). In conclusion, we successfully established camelid AEC cultures that recapitulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> airway epithelium and reflect MERS-CoV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In combination with human AEC cultures, this system allows detailed characterization of the molecular basis of MERS-CoV cross-species transmission in respiratory epithelium.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 as the causative agent of severe viral pneumonia in humans. To date, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported, with a case fatality rate of 34% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). MERS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that is intermittently transmitted from dromedary camels to humans leading to local outbreaks with limited human-to-human transmission. Sero-surveillance indicates that MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, and in contrast to humans, only causes a mild respiratory tract infection in camelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of zoonotic infections in humans, as well as higher sero-prevalence of camel exposed workers, are more frequently observed in the Middle East compared to Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Possible reasons for this pattern might lay in the genetic differences of the virus across the two regions, as well as cultural discrepancies or a lower awareness and surveillance in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Nevertheless, travel-related cases in 27 countries, as well as nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals, such as in South Korea in 2015 (186 cases and 36 deaths), have been reported and highlight the need for continuous surveillance to mitigate future epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The anatomical distance of the conducting airways is markedly different between camelids and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Concordantly, viral shedding during MERS-CoV infection in humans and camelids is dissimilar, as exemplified by the detection of relatively high levels of MERS-CoV in the upper respiratory tracts of infected camelids, as opposed to humans, in which the infection is restricted to the lower respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This can be partly explained by the different distribution of the functional receptor – serine exopeptidase Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) – for MERS-CoV in humans and camelids, which likely influences the limited human-to-human transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, the observed discrepancy in the clinical resolution between MERS-CoV infected humans and camelids also suggests that other host determinants, such as the innate immune system, might be of importance.</p><p id="P4">To facilitate investigations that are focused on the molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis discrepancy of MERS-CoV in humans and camelids, we develop a pseudostratified airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model for llama (<italic>Llama glama</italic>) and Bactrian camel (<italic>Camelus bactrianus</italic>), analogous to the human AEC culture model. Histological and functional characterization revealed that both camelid AEC culture models closely resemble the <italic>in vivo</italic> morphology, actively respond to IFNs, and are permissive to MERS-CoV. These three characteristics illustrate that the established camelid AEC model allows detailed future comparative studies on virus-host interactions in human and camelid respiratory epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of camelid airway epithelial cell cultures</title><p id="P5">To generate <italic>in vitro</italic> models that potentially serve as surrogates to characterize MERS-CoV – host interaction at the main replication site in the host reservoir, we sought to establish well-differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures from camelids, analogous to human AEC cultures. Unfortunately, there was no tracheobronchial tissue available from <italic>Camelus Dromedarius</italic> during the entire study period (2014 – 2021), due to national import and export restrictions. As both Bactrian camels and llama are also susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, we chose to isolate primary epithelial cells from post-mortem tissue from tracheobronchial regions of <italic>Camelus bactrianus</italic> (1 donor) and <italic>Lama glama</italic> (2 donors) and propagated them using a pre-established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Following the isolation and expansion, epithelial cells from the old and new world camelids were seeded on semi-permeable cell culture inserts. Once cells reached confluency, the cultures were air-lifted to establish an Air-liquid interface (ALI) to allow for cellular differentiation. During the differentiation process, the development of the camelid AEC cultures was monitored by immunofluorescence analysis with 7-day intervals for a total duration of 28 days.</p><p id="P6">This revealed a progressive ciliary development in both Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures that reached a plateau after three weeks for the llama AEC cultures. For the Bactrian camel AEC cultures, the overall number of ciliated cells was slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Nonetheless, for both species tight junction formation seemed to stabilize two weeks after ALI establishment as indicated by the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement and condensed hexagonal architecture of the tight junction marker Zona Occludens 1 (ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, D</xref>). In addition to the quantitative measurements, camelid AEC cultures were histologically compared with autologous <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissue from the corresponding anatomical region. These vertical histologic sections demonstrated that after 28 days of differentiation the camelid AEC cultures formed pseudostratified layer of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Combined these results demonstrate that the well-differentiated camelid AEC cultures exhibit morphological properties resembling the Bactrian camel and llama tracheobronchial respiratory epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Efficient MERS-CoV replication in Camelid AEC cultures</title><p id="P7">Following the establishment of the camelid AEC cultures, we assessed the expression and distribution of the functional receptor for MERS-CoV in formalin-fixed AEC cultures using a polyclonal antibody against DPP4. As a positive control, we included the Vero E6 cell line, which is known to express DPP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This revealed that DPP4 could readily be detected in both Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Of note, the Bactrian camel DPP4 was predominantly distributed at the apical surface of non-ciliated cell populations, while in llama AEC cultures, DPP4 expression is mainly restricted to the apical surface of the ciliated cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). To determine whether both camelid AEC models are susceptible to MERS-CoV, we inoculated well-differentiated Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures with 4000 PFU of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV EMC/2012) at 37 °C. At 2 hours post-infection (hpi), the apical surface was washed three times with HBSS. Subsequently, virus progeny release was monitored every 24h for the duration of 96 hours by virus titration and qRT-PCR. Interestingly, in both Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures we observed efficient, albeit dissimilar, MERS-CoV replication profiles. In Bactrian camel AEC cultures MERS-CoV readily reached a plateau at 24 hpi after which the amount of infectious progeny virus declined overtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, C</xref>). In contrast, the overall MERS-CoV replication kinetics in llama AEC cultures was delayed, as MERS-CoV reached the highest titer at 96 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Following the replication kinetics, we also assessed the viral cell tropism with immunofluorescence analysis at 48 hpi using an antibody against double stranded RNA (dsRNA), as a surrogate marker for active viral replication. This highlighted that in both Bactrian camel AEC cultures dsRNA was mainly observed in non-ciliated cell populations, similar as in human AEC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <bold>left panels</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In contrast, in the llama AEC cultures dsRNA-positive cells were predominantly co-stained with the cellular ß-tubulin marker used to detect ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that both camelid AEC cultures support efficient MERS-CoV replication and indicate that the viral cell tropism coincides with the DPP4 distribution in the AEC models from both camelid species.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Recombinant IFN inhibits MERS-CoV replication</title><p id="P9">We have previously demonstrated that MERS-CoV replication can be reduced upon exogenous type I and III IFN treatment in human AEC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, prior to assessing whether MERS-CoV replication can be reduced upon exogenous type I and III IFN treatment in both camelid AEC cultures we first determined whether the cell-intrinsic innate immune system is functional. For this, we stimulated camelid AEC cultures with recombinant pan-species type I IFN, human type III IFN, and synthetic dsRNA (poly-I:C) and analyzed the induction of several host transcripts at 6 h and 12 h post-treatment. This revealed that stimulations by exogenous type I and type III IFNs lead to the induction of canonical ISGs, such as Mx1, CXCL10, and RIG-I in both camelid AEC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Stimulation with poly I:C, a surrogate for active virus replication, resulted in the induction of both ISGs and chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), signifying that both the sensing and signaling arms of the cell-intrinsic innate immune system seem to be intact in both camelid AEC models.</p><p id="P10">After having established the functionality of the innate immune system in the camelid AEC cultures, we assessed whether exogenous type I and III IFN treatment could reduce MERS-CoV replication in the camelid AEC cultures, similar as in human AEC cultures. For this, camelid AEC cultures were pre-stimulated with exogenous type I or III IFNs for 18 hours prior to MERS-CoV infection. Forty-eight hours post-infection, we observed that in the Bactrian camel AEC cultures apical progeny virus release was reduced by 3.5 to 4 logs by type I and type III IFNs, respectively. Interestingly, for the llama AEC cultures we observed that both type of IFNs markedly reduced MERS-CoV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results were corroborated by immunofluorescence analysis at 48h, in which the number of dsRNA positive cells are reduced in IFN treated cultures compared to untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This indicates that, like human AEC cultures, MERS-CoV replication can be reduced in both camelid AEC cultures upon type I and III IFN pretreatments. Combined, these results demonstrate that the established camelid AEC models facilitates future experimental work to dissect fundamental virus – host interactions within the camelid respiratory epithelium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">In the current study, we have successfully established well-differentiated AEC cultures from Bactrian camel and llama as surrogate <italic>in vitro</italic> models to study MERS-CoV in the camelid hosts. We show that the camelid AEC cultures are well-differentiated, possess a functional innate immunity, and support efficient MERS-CoV replication. We observe the cell tropisms and replication kinetics profiles during MERS-CoV infection are dissimilar among the old-world and new-world camelid AEC cultures. In addition, we demonstrated that pretreatments with exogenous type I and III IFNs were able to reduce MERS-CoV viral replication in both camelid AEC cultures. Our data suggest that well-differentiated camelid AEC cultures can serve as a more biologically relevant system that morphologically and functionally resembles the natural site of infection of MERS-CoV in camelids. This approach can help to circumvent the needs of certain animal experiments, especially since experiments using large animals such as camelids are difficult to conduct due to their limited availability and logistical requirements.</p><p id="P12">While dromedary camels are shown as the main zoonotic reservoir for MERS-CoV, susceptibility of both Bactrian camel and llama to MERS-CoV by either natural or experimental infection has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Although both species are genetically closely related, we show that the replication profile as well as cell tropisms of MERS-CoV are different in Bactrian camel and llama, in line with those observed results in experimentally infected camels and llamas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Interestingly, as the natural habitat of Bactrian camels shows a higher overlap to that of dromedary camels, the reservoir for MERS-CoV compared to llamas, MERS-CoV might evolutionarily favor and be better adapted to the Bactrian camel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Differences in MERS-CoV cell tropism can be explained by the distinct MERS-CoV receptor distribution between camel and llama AEC cultures. Nevertheless, differential DPP4 distribution along the respiratory tract of camelids and other ungulates which correlates to their susceptibility has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, it was previously shown that the presence of DPP4 alone does not always translate to susceptibility in other animals <italic>in vivo</italic>, highlighting the importance of investigating the role of other host determinants in the outcome of MERS-CoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In this study, we demonstrate that camelid AEC cultures are responsive to type I and III IFN stimuli and that pretreatment with exogenous IFNs can reduce MERS-CoV replication, similar to previously observed results in primary human AEC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, despite the close evolutionary relationship between llamas and Bactrian camels, we did observe a species-specific difference in the efficacy of inhibiting MERS-CoV replication upon exogenous stimulation with type I and III IFNs. This suggests potential differences in IFN receptor distribution and/or downstream signaling cascades inducing the expression of ISGs tempering MERS-CoV replication. These results, together with the previously reported <italic>in vivo</italic> data of MERS-CoV infection in alpacas, suggest dominant role for type I and III IFNs in camelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Moreover, since both recombinant type I and III IFNs also efficiently inhibited MERS-CoV in human AEC cultures it would be worth to evaluate the therapeutic potential of IFNs towards MERS-CoV, as well as further investigating MERS-CoV interaction with IFN-related pathways in different host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Such analyses can now be performed using the camelid AEC cultures in conjunction with the analogous human AEC cultures, to provide detailed information on crucial virus-host innate immune response dynamics in both the natural and zoonotic hosts.</p><p id="P14">In summary, our results demonstrate that these cultures can serve as a biologically relevant model to characterize fundamental molecular virus-host interactions of MERS-CoV at the natural site of infection in camelids. Altogether, the established camelid AEC culture system, in combination with human AEC cultures, facilitates future detailed characterization of the molecular basis of the pathogenesis discrepancy of MERS-CoV in humans and camelids in a biologically relevant system.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Establishment of camelid AEC cultures</title><p id="P15">Tracheobronchial epithelial cells from Bactrian camel and llama were isolated from post-mortem tracheobronchial tissue, obtained in collaboration with the veterinary hospital of the University of Bern that euthanized their animals for diagnostic purposes.

A serial dilution of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed MERS-CoV RNA (kindly provided by Victor Corman) was used as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Measurements and analysis were performed with the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Systems and associated software (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title><p id="P23">Cells were fixated with 4% formalin for immunofluorescence analysis. Fixated cells were permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.1% (w/v) Saponin, and 2% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin and stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against dsRNA (SCICONS, clone J2). Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled donkey-anti mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch, 715-545-150) was used as a secondary antibody. To visualize the cellular receptor DPP4, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against DPP4 (Abcam, ab28340) was used. Subsequently, Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled donkey-anti rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-545-152) was used as a secondary antibody. Alexa-Fluor® 647-labelled rabbit anti β-tubulin IV (Cell Signalling Technology, 9F3) and Alexa-Fluor® 594-labelled mouse antibody against ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1A12) were used to visualize cilia and tight junctions, respectively. Cells were counterstained using 4’ ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize the nuclei. Images were acquired using an EVOS FL Auto 2 Imaging System, using 40x air objectives. Brightness and contrast were adjusted identically to the corresponding controls using the Fiji software packages and figures were assembled using FigureJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Quantification of the ciliation was done on five randomized fields of view of β-tubulin-stained inserts acquired at 40x objective by measuring cilia-positive area above the threshold.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by research grants from the European Commission (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training
