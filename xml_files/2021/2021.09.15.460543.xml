<p id="P1">The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome is evolving as the viral pandemic continues its active phase around the world. The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of Nsp3 – a large multidomain protein that is an essential component of the replication-transcription complex, making it a good therapeutic target. PLpro is a multi-functional protein encoded in coronaviruses that can cleave viral polyproteins, poly-ubiquitin and protective Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 product, ISG15, which mimics a head-to-tail linked ubiquitin (Ub) dimer. PLpro across coronavirus families showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of these protein substrates despite sequence conservation. However, it is not clear how sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro alter its selectivity for substrates and what outcome this has on the pathogenesis of the virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro preferentially binds ISG15 over Ub and K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>. We determined crystal structures of PLpro in complex with human K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> and ISG15 revealing that dual domain recognition of ISG15 drives substrate selectivity over Ub and Ub<sub>2</sub>. We also characterized the PLpro substrate interactions using solution NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry to support that ISG15 is recognized via two domains while Ub<sub>2</sub> binds primarily through one Ub domain. Finally, energetic analysis of the binding interfaces between PLpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with ISG15 and Ub<sub>2</sub> define the sequence determinants for how PLpros from different coronaviruses recognize two topologically distinct substrates and how evolution of the protease altered its substrate selectivity. Our work reveals how PLpro substrate selectivity may evolve in PLpro coronaviruses variants enabling design of more effective therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The current pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is a typical member of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family and has spherical, enveloped, non-segmented, (+) sense RNA virion with a large ~30 kbs genome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The genome is used as mRNA for translation of a replication-transcription complex (RTC) constituents made of two large polyproteins, Pp1a and Pp1ab, and as a template for replication of its own (-) sense copy. The Pp1a and Pp1ab polypeptides are processed by two viral proteases: papain-like protease (PLpro, a domain within non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3)), and 3C-like protease (Nsp5 or 3CLpro or Mpro). The PLpro enzyme is essential for several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the RTC, and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved and found in all coronaviruses, often in two copies, denoted as PL1pro and PL2pro. It was shown that PL1pro is dispensable but PL2pro is essential suggesting that their functions are non-overlapping<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. These enzymes are found in coronaviruses (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and in arteriviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. PLpro is a domain of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) – a large multidomain protein (~212 kDa) that is a component of the RTC and has other functions. The enzyme is located between the SARS unique domain (SUD/HVR) and a nucleic acid-binding domain. PLpro cleaves 3 sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins yielding Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3; and the “LXGG↓XX” motif found in Pp1a/Pp1ab corresponds to the P4–P1 substrate positions of cysteine proteases and is essential for recognition and cleavage by PLpro. The “LXGG” motif is also found in human ubiquitin and ISG15. The PLpro active site contains a canonical cysteine protease catalytic triad (Cys111, His272 and Asp286). PLpro may have catalytic properties more common with other cysteine proteases, with the generally accepted thiolate form of Cys111 acting as a nucleophile and Asp286 promoting deprotonation of His272, which serves as a base. Interestingly, the PL1pro and PL2pro enzymes from different coronaviruses exhibits diverse specificities for substrates suggesting that discrete sequence changes play a role in modulating binding affinity. PLpro has been shown to inactivate TBK1, block NF-kappaB signaling, prevent translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, inhibit the TLR7 signaling pathway, and induce Egr-1-dependent up-regulation of TGF-β1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Further illustrating the complex and diverse functions of the protein, in some reports, some PLpro roles are decoupled from its proteolytic activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 PL2pro sequence is conserved between SARS-CoV-1 (83% identical, 90% similar), MERS-CoV (30% identical, 49% similar) and other coronaviruses, and their structures are very similar. Fortuitously, it has low sequence similarity to human enzymes. PLpros share structural architecture and catalytic site with the human ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs), one of the five distinct deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) families, despite low sequence identities (~10%)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. In addition, due to the centrality of PLpro to viral replication, it is an excellent and attractive candidate for therapeutic targeting.</p>
<p id="P4">In addition to processing virus polyproteins, it was shown in SARS- and MERS-CoVs that their PLpro have deubiquitinating activity, efficiently disassembling Ub and polyUb conjugates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Ubiquitination is essential post-translational modification mediated by the Ub-conjugating system that plays complex regulatory roles in humans, including proteasome-dependent protein degradation. This process could be reversed by DUBs enzymes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. PLpro also has deISG15ylating activities<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. ISG15 is interferon alpha stimulated gene that is a critical component of antiviral response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. ISG15 has two Ub-like (UBL) domains and mimics a head-to-tail linked Ub<sub>2</sub>. Both Ub and ISG15 proteins carry the PLpro recognition motif at their C-termini. Removal of these modifications from specific substrates in host cells may have diverse impact on many cellular processes and specifically may frustrate the host response to viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. ISG15 is processed and subsequently activated in a manner similar to Ub using interferon induced factors that follow the ubiquitination-like E1, E2 and E3 enzyme cascade to mediate co-translational ISGylation – an addition of ISG15, via its C-terminal LRGG motif, to substrate lysine residues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. While it is not precisely clear how ISG15 interferes with viral processes it is believed that it can play many different roles by tagging newly translated viral proteins to sterically prevent their folding, assembly or recognition<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. While K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> and ISG15 are homologous both in sequence and fold, the topologies of how the two domains are linked are distinct. In addition to cleavage of Ub and ISG15 there is also evidence that there are other proteins in human genome that contain PLpro cleavage sites and have been shown to be cleaved, these proteins include MYH6, MYH7, FOXP3, PROS1, ErbB4 ULK1 and IRF-3 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Cleavage of these host proteins may be linked to cardiomyopathy and coagulopathy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. It thus remains unknown how PLpro discriminates between substrates and how sequence changes in the protease alter this selectivity.</p>
<p id="P5">To understand how SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can differentiate between Ub<sub>1</sub>, K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> and human ISG15 (hISG15) substrates, we employed complimentary biochemical, structural and computational approaches. Consistent with published reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, we find that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro binds with high affinity to hISG15 but binds more weakly to both K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub>. To test how this differential substrate recognition is manifested structurally, we determined structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with human ISG15 and K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> to uncover that high affinity binding to hISG15 is determined by dual domain recognition while K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> is recognized through only one domain. We further tested this PLpro substrate binding model leveraging domain specific isotope labeling of K48-Ub<sub>2</sub>, Ub<sub>1</sub> and ISG15 in chemical shift perturbation (CSPs) experiments. The NMR experiments, together with cross-linking mass spectrometry suggest that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro recognizes a single Ub domain of K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> but both domains in ISG15 are recognized. Finally, we interpret our findings in the context of PLpro sequence variation performing an <italic>in silico</italic> ΔΔG alanine scan on PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in complex with K48-Ub<sub>2</sub>/ISG15 substrates to uncover recognition rules how sequence evolution impacts substrate selectivity. Our findings pave the way to understand the biological impact of sequence changes in PLpro on substrate binding and how evolution of the virus impacts this process.</p>

<title>Sequence and topological differences between hISG15 and K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>
</title>
<p id="P6">The two substrates, K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> and ISG15 are homologous both in sequence and fold of domains but the topologies of how the two domains are linked are distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The structure of the PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub>:K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> complex shows the proximal Ub bound to the Zn finger and palm domains via its nonpolar patch<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> (including residues L8, I44 and V70) placing the C-terminal tail in a groove with the carboxylate near the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. A recent structure of full-length mouse ISG15 (mISG15) bound to PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> revealed a distinct binding mode of the proximal and distal UBL domains of mISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The proximal UBL is shifted away from the finger domain compared to the proximal-Ub binding mode while still placing the C-terminal LRGG tail into the active site of the protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Comparison of mISG15 and Ub active surfaces reveals that the nonpolar patch on Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, pink) centered on I44 is more polar in human ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, magenta) suggesting a deviation in the polar/nonpolar patterning of this important recognition surface in Ub. Biochemical binding and cleavage assays have shown that PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> prefers K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> while the related PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> binds more tightly to mISG15 and cleaves it with near 20-fold enhancement compared to Ub<sub>2</sub>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> suggesting that the sequence variation at the substrate binding interface between PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> and PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> may dictate substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Based on these sequence differences a specificity switch between Ub and ISG15 for PLpro was proposed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, the human and mouse ISG15 sequence are 65% identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) but also vary quite significantly in the active binding surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, purple and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, sequence comparison of the distal and proximal UBL domains of human ISG15 to Ub reveals additional variation beyond the topology. To gain insight whether the proposed hISG15 and K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> specificity switch is maintained, we used microscale thermophoresis binding experiments to quantify binding between PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> and three substrates: hISG15, K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1.</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Our data indicate that PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> binds to hISG15 with 778 ± 104 nM affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, purple). Binding of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to K48 Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, grey) is much weaker than for hISG15, but somewhat stronger than Ub<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, pink). Indeed, while the sequence conservation between mouse and hISG15 deviates even in the “conserved” binding surface, there remains a clear preference of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to bind ISG15 over K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub>. We also show that PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> is active and can efficiently cleave ISG15 with cleavage sequences derived from the Nsp2, Nsp3 and Nsp4 cleavage sites appended following the LRGG motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Finally, we show that the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> can efficiently hydrolyze K48-linked Ub<sub>3</sub> but the protease surprisingly has no preference for cleavage of the first or second K48-link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>) consistent with no strict requirement to bind Ub in both the proximal and distal domains as indicated by similar affinities between Ub<sub>1</sub> and Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<title>Dual vs single domain substrate recognition determines PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> selectivity</title>
<p id="P7">To explain differences in affinity between the hISG15 and K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> we determined two crystal structures of PLpro from SARS-CoV-2, including a catalytically inactive C111S mutant of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> in complex with hISG15 at 2.97 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> at 1.88 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined as described in Methods; data and refinement statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Structures were refined as described in Methods; data and refinement statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. For the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:hISG15 we observed well resolved electron density for the proximal and distal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). By contrast, for the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>: K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), we observed only strong electron density in the proximal domain with only weak signal for the distal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Despite of questionable electron density for Ub<sub>2</sub> distal domain, we are convinced of its presence in our crystals because portions of densities resemble amino acid chains and only slight tuning of Ub<sub>2</sub> distal domain from superposed structure of SARS PLpro bound to a K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> (PDB id: 5E6J)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> is necessary to fit densities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Also, there is enough room in our crystals to accommodate distal domain in conformation almost identical to the structure of PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> bound to a K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). The structures of PLpro complexes with two topologically distinct substrates, Ub<sub>2</sub> and ISG15, revealed how the protease differentially recognizes hISG15 using both domains while K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> is predominantly recognized using the proximal domain. These data are consistent with our binding experiments showing that ISG15 binds tightly while Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub> bind similarly but Ub<sub>1</sub> binds more weakly. We additionally determined structures of the hISG15 and K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> in the absence of the protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The hISG15 and the K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> structures were determined to 2.15 Å and 1.25 Å resolution, respectively, using molecular replacement as described in the Methods. We initially compared the bound hISG15 to the free hISG15 conformation and surprisingly, they are quite similar with a Cα rmsd 1.1 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We performed a similar comparison of our unbound K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> structure with the only bound conformation of K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> observed in the previously reported PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> structure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> revealing a Cα rmsd of 11.9 Å<sup>2</sup>. We observe that the domains are oriented very differently relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) with the bound conformation in an extended conformation (similar to hISG15) while the unbound conformation in an “open” conformation with the functional surfaces (i.e. I44 etc) exposed for binding. We also compared the “bound” conformation with two other canonical “open” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and “closed” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) conformations of K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> revealing large differences by Cα rmsd of 10.4 Å<sup>2</sup> and11.3 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In the “open” conformation we again observe that the functional binding surface on Ub is exposed while in the “closed” conformation the functional surfaces are engaged in inter-ubiquitin self-self interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, arrow). These data highlight that the hISG15 and the K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> substrates are recognized differently by PLpro and that the substrates appear to have different conformational ensembles in the unbound state that may influence recognition of the substrates.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Functional surfaces of hISG15 and K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> are recognized differentially by PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>
</title>
<p id="P8">We first compared the binding modes of ISG15 and proximal Ub from our new structures. Similar to previous analyses we find that the structures have a Cα rmsd of 0.85 Å<sup>2</sup>. This deviation is largely dictated by the conformation of the proximal domain where the active surface of Ub is shifted towards the palm domain compared to the proximal UBL domain of ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This shift in binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) between the two domains is largely manifested by a rotation of the functional surface of Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) compared to ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This is despite the structure of the two domains being nearly identical with a Cα rmsd of 0.95 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) thus this largely must be dictated by changes in the binding mode due to the varying amino acid properties of the binding surfaces between Ub and ISG15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3cd</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. We performed cross-linking experiments using individual components and heterodimer complexes formed between PLpro with Ub<sub>2</sub> or hISG15 using all three chemistries. We proceeded with the DMTMM condition which yields high-resolution zero-length cross-links and where we observed robust production of a heterodimer complex for PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:hISG15 but weaker signal for the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). XL-MS analysis of replicate datasets for the heterodimer species isolated from the DMTMM reactions reveals robust and high frequency detection of 11 and 17 contacts between D61 and D62 on PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to K35 on the distal domain of ISG15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). By contrast, we only detected 4 cross-links between K45 of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to D58 on Ub and 4 cross-links between D164 on PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to K6 on Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Mapping the D61 and D62 from PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> to K35 to hISG15 cross-link on the new x-ray structure reveals overall good consistency with cross-link geometries between the carboxylate (D61/62) and Nε (K35) with distances of 9.38 Å and 7.7-11.7 Å for the contacts across heterodimer molecules in the asymmetric unit, respectively. These data suggest that this binding loop located between the UBL and thumb domain in PLpro <sub>CoV-2</sub> may be mobile in solution. By contrast, because of the sequence degeneracy between the proximal and distal Ub domains we cannot unambiguously assign the positions but can interpret the data based on best distance match (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). We find that the Ub K6 to PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> D164 cross-link is most consistent with the interaction with the proximal Ub domain with a distance of 21.1Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 4c</xref>). The other cross-link between K45 in the UBL domain of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> and D58 in Ub is long for both proximal and distal Ub placement. We wondered whether the UBL domain on PLpro might be flexible and function as substrate thus placing the UBL onto the distal binding site. Analysis of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> intramolecular contacts from the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:hISG15 and the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:Ub<sub>2</sub> heterodimer datasets identified 17 and 2 intramolecular contacts in the protease, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). Mapping the contacts on the structure of the protease revealed good distance agreement with cross-linker geometries with the exception of the contacts involving the UBL domain and the terminal helix from the thumb domain that reach to the palm domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). These intramolecular contacts that cannot be explained by the structure may suggest that the UBL domain in PLpro can potentially sample “substrate bound” conformations. Our cross-link experiments reaffirm that the hISG15 binds tightly to PLpro utilizing a stable bound distal domain. By contrast, in the PLpro:K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> complex we only detect a contact between the proximal Ub domain and PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>. Finally, our cross-link data may indicate possible structural rearrangements involving the N-terminal UBL domain from PLpro.

<italic>In silico</italic> alanine scan of PLpros from SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 in complex with substrates reveals binding hotspots and specificity determining residues</title>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup> to mutate each PLpro interface residue to alanine and compare the energy of WT to mutant to calculate a ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub>. Interestingly, this analysis identified interaction hotspots and showed how they vary between the four complexes. Pairwise comparison of the calculated ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> for the two substrates bound to PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> revealed positions that provide significant binding contribution in each complex, most notably PLpro residues E167 and F69/Y264 were identified as hotspot residues that partition to the proximal and distal UBL binding sites in both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). However, comparing the difference in the ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> between the two substrates reveals a substrate preference at each site. For PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>, the distal site has a preference for ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,e</xref>, colored in red) but the proximal site has a preference for Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,e</xref>, in blue). A similar analysis for PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub>:hISG15 bound to the two substrates identified similar hotspots sites utilizing E167 and F69/Y264 as core binding sites for each substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Unexpectedly, the ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> difference highlights the opposite trend observed in PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> where PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> prefers Ub binding in the distal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 6d,f</xref>, colored in blue). Consistent with our structural and biochemical findings PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> stabilizes interactions to the distal domain of ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In protein complexes, residues that surround protein interaction hotspots typically play important roles in determining specificity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, residues that surround the hotspots contribute differently between the two complexes. For example, in the proximal-binding site, residue Y171 provides significant binding energy in the complex with hISG15 but does not contribute much in the complex with Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Consistent with the PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> preference for Ub<sub>2</sub> this residue is modified to histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). More importantly this site also appears to be mutating in the SARS-CoV-1 population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that this position may play a central role in switching substrate specificity and probing how these changes impact virus fitness in human populations. Additional residues that vary between the two coronaviruses are V66, T75 and P77 which surround the second hotspot F69 position and thus also likely switch substrate specificity in the distal UBL binding site. Mutations of these individual positions that vary between the two predict modest changes with only V66S in PLpro <sub>CoV-2</sub> appears to shift binding of the distal domain to Ub (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) and conversely mutations of S66V in PLpro <sub>CoV-1</sub> have a predicted opposite effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). These analyses highlight how prediction of binding energetics combined with structural data can help guide the interpretation in changes in specificity for substrate binding in similar complexes against a panel of substrates.</p>

<title>Evolution of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> sequence suggests alterations in substrate specificity</title>

We also wondered whether the proposed hosts for RaTG13 coronaviruses have conserved ISG15 sequences. Different species belonging to the genus of Pteropodidae (large flying bats) have been identified as a major source of lineage D β coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Sequence alignment of ISG15 from 4 species of large flying bats shows overall high sequence conservation for this protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Furthermore, it appears that while this sequence is not absolutely conserved in comparison with human ISG15 the active binding surface on the proximal domain is more similar to human than mouse. Furthermore, sequence comparison of human ISG15 to ISG15 derived from the black flying fox bat (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>), a putative host of the BAT_RaTG13 has only 62% identity but the active surface on the proximal UB domain is more conserved than mouse ISG15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Together with high PLpro sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 it may be possible that PLpro evolved to interact with ISG15 in bats which is also compatible with human ISG15. Mapping the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 variation in PLpro in the context of Ub<sub>2</sub> and ISG15 binding reveals 8 sites of sequence variation that localize to substrate binding surfaces in the fingers, the lower thumb and upper thumb that make contacts with the proximal and distal Ub/UBL substrate binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The two mutated sites observed in the BAT_RATG13 sequence are also present in the SARS-CoV-1. Additionally, there are sites (i.e. Y171) that make stabilizing contacts to ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Specifically, residue Y171 in PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> makes key interactions to P130 in a loop on ISG15 while in the SARS-CoV-1 sequence the tyrosine is mutated to histidine which cannot form stabilizing contacts with ISG15. Another important PLpro residue in this region is E167. It coordinates a network of interactions including two direct hydrogen bonds to R153 of ISG15 and its aliphatic portion of the side chain makes hydrophobic interaction with W123. In the complex of PLpro with Ub E167 makes one hydrogen bond to R42. Because of W123 mutation to R in proximal Ub this interaction is no longer possible. In the distal Ub/UBL-binding sites, we also observe several mutations that include changes like V66S, T75L and P77E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Notably, these changes alter the nonpolar <italic>vs</italic>. polar patterning of the protease surface which might play a role in recruiting the distal UBL domain and might indicate adaptation of PLpro to hISG15. Finally, we performed a similar analysis on 1.1 million available SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from the Coronavirus3D database<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>

Surprisingly, many positions that vary between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 sample mutational sites observed in the SARS-CoV-2 isolates, including contacts to the proximal and distal Ub/UBL domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). This analysis suggests that the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> protease may be evolving new substrate specificities, perhaps towards higher selectivity to hydrolyze ubiquitinated substrates. It is not clear how changes in substrate specificity alter disease outcomes, but current data suggest that ISG15 is a preferred target of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> potentially allowing SARS-CoV-2 to narrow its response and more efficiently evade the interferon induced mechanism by inactivating ISGylation<sup>

Sequence analysis suggests that the PLpro from these two viruses only vary at 8 amino acid positions at the substrate binding interface implicating only minor sequence changes responsible for this specificity switch. Thus far it has remained unclear how this specificity switch is distributed across the sequence and binding interfaces. The original structure of PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> bound to K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> revealed both Ubs bound to the protease through binding sites present in both proximal and distal Ubs with minor caveats of the linkage not being hydrolysable and the C-terminal tail covalently linked to the protease. There remains no structure of the ISG15 bound to PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> suggesting that the dramatically reduced affinity must impact binding both proximal and distal binding UBL domains of ISG15. Our new structure of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> bound to human ISG15 as well as the previously determined structure of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> bound to mISG15 reveal a dual UBL domain recognition binding mode despite surprising sequence variation between the mouse and human forms of ISG15, in particular the substrate binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Our <italic>in silico</italic> alanine scan of the interfaces uncovered which residues may play central roles in stabilizing the ISG15 binding mode for PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> and implicated V66 as being important for stabilizing the distal UBL domain of ISG15.

<title>Impact of PLpro sequence drift on substrate specificity</title>
<p id="P15">Much of the focus on understanding how sequence variation impacts pathogenicity, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 has been centered on sequence changes in surface proteins such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein which are essential for recognition of ACE2, virus entry into host cell and thus infectivity. Furthermore, there is concern that mutations in the viral receptors may overcome vaccines which were designed against an engineered prefusion “stabilized” conformation of RBD of the spike protein. Therefore, additional SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps must be explored, and appropriate key drug targets identified to expand treatment options. Viral interference with host innate immune response is one of these steps of which ISG15 is integral. Several coronavirus Nsps have been shown to contribute to diminishing this complex response mechanism. Modeling of the protein interfaces suggest that the sequence variation between PLpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 plays are role in recognition specificity of host factors. Furthermore, we also show that sequence variation within PLpro from 1.1 million SARS-CoV-2 isolates is overall distributed with some hotspots that mimic sequence variation observed between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. While we do not understand how differential recognition of Ub compared to ISG15 impacts pathogenicity and virulence of SARS, balance between dysregulation of the protective interferon response and UPS systems likely has important impacts in the virus evading host defense systems. Future work must be focused on understanding how protease specificity impacts pathogenicity. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether PLpro encodes additional specificity for the substrates that are linked to Ub or ISG15 modifications.</p>

<title>Conformational changes in PLpro substrates responsible for observed “single domain” and “dual domain” recognition mode</title>
<p id="P16">PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> must recognize and process multiple substrates: polyproteins 1a and 1ab, polyUb and ISG15. All these substrates have common sequence recognition motif “LXGG”, however they differ in several ways. In polyproteins PLpro cleaves regular peptide bond. In K48-linked poly-Ub and ISG15 the cleaved peptide bond is between lysine side chain (Ub or other protein substrate) and C-terminal carboxylate, but these substrates have two distinct topologies. We and others have showed that PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> switched specificity from K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> to ISG15. The switch is associated with sequence variation but also with conformational changes that are required to utilize these mutations. It is interesting that conformation of PLpro in complexes with Ub, hISG15 and mISG15 is very similar (0.7 Å<sup>2</sup> rmsd on C<italic>α</italic> atoms).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P17">Our studies revealed in detail the sequence determinants for how PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 recognizes two substrates and how sequence evolution of the protease may have remarkable effects on substrate specificity but the role of these sequence changes in disease remain unknown. Analysis of mutations on SARS-CoV-2 shows that many different factors beyond interaction with host cell receptors, receptor activation or viral replication rates, etc. may contribute to viral infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence. PLpro encodes new enzymatic activity that interferes with innate immune responses of host and thus it impacts how viral components interact with host factors. The fact that PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 prefers ISG15 over Ub as a substrate suggests that the virus response is simplified and now focuses on ISG15-mediated pathways. Insight into how the protease balances binding different substrates as the virus continues to evolve will enable design of more effective therapies.</p>

<title>Energetic analysis of PLpro in complex with hISG15 and K48-Ub<sub>2</sub>

For the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:hISG15 complex, we used a heterodimer conformation derived from the crystal structure deposited in the protein data bank (PDB ID: 7RBS). To create the complex between PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> and K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>, we used the conformation and binding mode of K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> bound to PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> (PDB ID: 5E6J) as a template<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> deposited in the protein data bank (PDB ID: 5E6J), and to create the PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub>:hISG15 complex, we employed the same procedure as used to make the PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> complex (see above). Next, we applied a relax protocol in Rosetta all four complexes: PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub>:K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>, PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>,PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub>:hISG15 and PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>:hISG15. To guarantee that each instance of relax is being run with different randomizations, groups of nstruct were run with different, randomly generated seeds using random.org. From 100 total structures (4×25 nstruct for computational efficiency) for each heterocomplex, the lowest energy structure was identified and used in further steps. The list of PLpro residues that may be engaged in interacting with its substrate was created by identifying PLpro residues in proximity of 4.0 Å of either hISG15 or K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>. The union list of interacting residues identified with heterocomplexes PLpro:hISG15 and PLpro:K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> was used in the next step. For PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> in complex with hISG15/K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> 49 positions were used to describe the combined interface. For PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> in complex with hISG15/K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> 47 positions were selected. Selection of common interface residues was carried out in PyMOL 2.4.1. Flex ΔΔG protocol was used as described previously <sup>

</sup>. The code is available on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Kortemme-Lab">https://github.com/Kortemme-Lab</ext-link>. Briefly, selected interacting residues were mutated to alanines. Alternatively, mutations were made to residues from PLpro from either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Parameters were used (all default settings): nstruct = 35, max_minimization_iter = 5000, abs_score_convergence thresh = 1.0, number_backrub_trials = 35000, and to enable earlier time points backrub_trajectory_stride was set to 7000. The ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> score for the last iteration was shown in the Results. These simulations were performed using BioHPC computing cluster at UT Southwestern Medical Center. The results, in raw REU (Rosetta energy units), are shown as a heat-map with ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> values but also as the difference between the ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> from hISG15 compared to K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub>. The plots were made using GraphPad Prism 8 and mapped onto the protease structure using PyMOL 2.4.1. The relax protocol and Flex_ΔΔG used Rosetta v3.13 and v3.12, respectively.</p>

<title>PLpro architecture and substrate recognition.</title>
<p>(a) Binding mode of K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> to PLpro<sub>CoV-1</sub> and mISG15 to PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>. PLpro is shown in surface representation and colored grey. K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> is shown in cartoon representation and colored white and pink for the proximal and distal Ubs, respectively. We call ‘distal’ the Ub unit connected through its C-terminus to K48 of the other Ub unit, called ‘proximal’. mISG15 is shown in cartoon representation and colored magenta. In analogy with the two Ubs in Ub<sub>2</sub>, the N- and C-terminal UBL (ubiquitin like) domains of ISG15 will be referred to as the distal and proximal UBLs, respectively. (b) Sequence comparison of Ub, hISG15 and mISG15 nonpolar patch important for UBL recognition. Ub and ISG15 are shown in cartoon representation and are colored pink and magenta. Key residues that define the nonpolar patch on Ub and ISG15 (proximal domain) are shown in spacefill and highlighted with arrows. (c) Topology of K48-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> and mISG15 (bottom). LRGG sequence is shown in the C-term. (d) MST binding analysis of substrates to PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub>. Comparison of PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> binding to hISG15 (magenta, K<sub>d</sub>=0.8 <italic>μ</italic>M), Ub<sub>2</sub> (grey, K<sub>d</sub>=35 <italic>μ</italic>M) and Ub<sub>1</sub> (pink, K<sub>d</sub>=120 <italic>μ</italic>M). (e) PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> cleavage of hISG15-Nsp C-terminal fusions. SDS-PAGE gel reveals that PLpro cleaves off fragments of Nsp2 (AYTRYVDNNF), Nsp3 (APTKVTFGDD), and Nsp4 (KIVNNWLKQL) from hISG15-Nsp fusions linked to the recognition motif “LRGG”. (f) PLpro<sub>CoV-2</sub> cleavage of Ub<sub>3</sub>. SDS-PAGE gel reveals that PLpro cleaves Ub<sub>3</sub> into Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub> efficiently.</p>
