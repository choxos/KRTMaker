To address this issue, we sub-cloned candidate iPSC lines and deeply characterised their genetic properties using whole genome sequencing, their genomic stability upon CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, and their phenotypic properties including differentiation to commonly-used cell types. These studies identified KOLF2.1J as an all-around well-performing iPSC line. We then shared KOLF2.1J with groups around the world who tested its performance in head-to-head comparisons with their own preferred iPSC lines across a diverse range of differentiation protocols and functional assays. On the strength of these findings, we have made KOLF2.1J and hundreds of its gene-edited derivative clones readily accessible to promote the standardization required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P4"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS154924-f007"/></fig>

Additionally, the genomes of iPSCs can be edited to introduce or correct disease-associated variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kwart et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Konttinen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guttikonda et al. 2021</xref>). For example, comparing control hiPSCs with isogenic knock-in of Mendelian variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) identified convergent transcriptomic events after differentiation into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kwart et al. 2019</xref>), or non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Konttinen et al. 2019</xref>). In theory, the results of isogenic experiments could be compared across genetic variants, cell types, and analysis modalities by different groups. However, the use of different cell lines by different groups creates an obstacle to data integration, since genetic background influences cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Doetschman 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bonyadi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Threadgill et al. 1995</xref>). This issue has been recognized by communities working with model organisms, who appreciated that the benefits of a common reference outweigh the idiosyncrasies of a particular line or strain, since key results obtained on one genetic background can always be tested on another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sterken et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mackay and Huang 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sittig et al. 2016</xref>). Consequently, there is a large, unmet need in the stem cell field for common, well-characterized cell lines.</p><p id="P6">Several recent efforts have sought to address these challenges by developing gene-edited iPSC clones from a common parental cell line and making these available to the community. For example, the Allen Cell Collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.allencell.org/genomics.html">https://www.allencell.org/genomics.html</ext-link>) generated a series of publicly-available, gene-edited reporters from the WTC11 iPSC line derived from a healthy donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Roberts et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2019</xref>). Here, we sought to identify a common cell line to facilitate large-scale collaborative studies such as the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) from the NIH’s Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD). The aim of this initiative is to generate hundreds of single nucleotide variant (SNV) knock-in, revertant, gene knockout, and endogenously-tagged CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC derivative lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) on well characterized genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ramos et al. 2021</xref>). To select candidate cell lines for this purpose, we first accounted for the freedom to modify and distribute the line and its derivatives, and then deeply characterized the genomic status, functional characteristics, and differentiation potential of multiple candidate iPSC lines, leading to the identification of KOLF2.1J as a lead reference cell line.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rationale and establishment of clonal candidate cell sub-lines</title><p id="P7">We set out to identify one or more deeply characterized human pluripotent stem cell lines to serve as a common reference for the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ramos et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Reilly et al., n.d</xref>.). Since human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines face usage restrictions in many countries, we chose to prioritize hiPSC lines to enable a reference line to be globally shared. Although we are firm believers in the value of generating a series of reference lines from both genetically male and female donors of diverse genetic ancestries, we initially prioritized male lines due to the possibility that random X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to variance in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mekhoubad et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bar et al. 2019</xref>) and because several genetic disorders that we plan to model are X-linked and thus more frequently expressed in males. We therefore searched public repositories and curated a series of iPSC lines, many of which have already been whole genome sequenced. We then focused on a subset of lines with broad consents for data sharing and further dissemination of the line and its derivatives, and identified KOLF2_C1, KUCG3, LNGPI1, MS19-ES-H, NCRM1, NCRM5, NN0003932, NN0004297, and PGP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">After obtaining these lines, we found that the vial of MS19-ES-H we obtained was prone to spontaneous differentiation, and therefore excluded it from further study. We then single-cell cloned each of the remaining parental cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1A</xref>) to reduce heterogeneity from genetic and epigenetic drift in culture. We refer to these derivatives as “sub-lines” that retain the name of the parental cell line. Simultaneously, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>) to correct a mutation present in one copy of <italic>ARID2</italic> in the KOLF2-C1 line(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hildebrandt et al. 2019</xref>) and named our sub-line KOLF2.1J to indicate its derivation at Jackson Laboratories and distinguish it from a similar sub-line derived in parallel at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (KOLF2.1S; Andrew Bassett, personal communication). We selected one to four sub-lines per parental cell line for further expansion based on their typical stem cell morphology under phase contrast microscopy and normal karyotype from the analysis of &gt;20 Giemsa-band metaphase chromosome spreads. Almost all tested sub-lines were euploid (46; XY; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1B</xref>), but some sub-lines harbored aberrant cells. For example, 2 of the 20 analyzed spreads from a KUCG3 sub-line showed a gain of chromosome 12. We therefore selected a single clonal sub-line from each parental line for further expansion into 192 replicate stock vials to ensure that they could be distributed and used as a similar passage to the characterizations described in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1C</xref>). To extend the standard karyotypic analysis, we analyzed 181 to 200 high-quality metaphase spreads for selected sub-lines at chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 by directional genomic hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Robinson et al. 2019</xref>). This data established that selected sub-lines (except for KUCG3) were karyotypically normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1D</xref>), as later further confirmed by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and by the analysis of gene-edited cell clones.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Morphology and proliferation rates</title><p id="P9">Each sub-line had the morphology expected for hiPSCs, including a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli, growth in colonies with well-defined borders, and an absence of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To compare their survival and growth rates, we dissociated each sub-line to a single-cell suspension, imaged cultures at 24 and 48 hours after plating to calculate their confluence, and then dissociated and counted cells 48 hours after plating. There was a significant difference between the sub-lines in their total cell numbers after 48 hours (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>7, 24</sub>= 185.1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, there was a significant main effect of time (repeated measures ANOVA; F<sub>2, 80</sub> = 1836, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and cell sub-line (F<sub>7, 80</sub> = 97.85, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), on confluency as well as a time x cell sub-line interaction (F<sub>14,80</sub>=45.76, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, Table 1E). These results show that all sub-lines had similar morphology but varied in their survival and proliferation rates.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pluripotency</title><p id="P10">The eight selected sub-lines were immunostained with antibodies against pluripotency markers TRA-1-60 and NANOG, and the percentage of immunopositive cells was quantified by flow cytometry analysis.

We pooled them together for joint library preparation and sequencing to minimize technical sources of variation, and then used genetic diversity to assign each cell to a sub-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang, McCarthy, and Stegle 2019</xref>). Since sub-lines NN0003932 and NN0004297 were derived from the same donor, these are represented in our dataset as NN_combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1B</xref>). UMAP projection of the data from 2,270 single cells revealed two distinct groups of cells, the largest corresponding to six genetically distinct sub-lines and one small outlier group primarily from one sub-line, LNGPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Louvain clustering identified 5 clusters within the larger group that arise largely from cell cycle states of the proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1C-D</xref>). Comparison of pluripotency markers across the 7 genetically distinct sub-lines showed consistent expression of core pluripotency-associated genes including <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>POU5F1</italic> (<italic>OCT4</italic>) and <italic>NANOG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1E</xref>) but LNGPI1 expressed higher levels of <italic>UTF1</italic> and other genes associated with inefficient neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jerber et al. 2021</xref>).

To measure p53 pathway function in our hiPSC sub-lines, we transfected cells with a reporter plasmid that contains 13 copies of a p53 DNA binding site linked to mCherry, and quantified mCherry expression by flow cytometry in response to treatment with vehicle or the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin. This analysis showed doxorubicin activated reporter expression in all eight selected sub-lines compared to <italic>TP53</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2</xref>). To confirm these results, we developed a more stable version of the P53 reporter based on an integrating piggyBac transposon and observed similar baseline and damage-induced activity of the P53 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). These results confirm integrity of the p53 pathway in all lines, with particularly robust responses in KOLF2.1J, LNGPI1, NCRM1, and PGP1.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Genomic characterization by whole genome sequencing (WGS)</title><p id="P13">To understand the genetic background of each sub-line, we sequenced their genomes at &gt;30x coverage. The distribution of insertion-deletion (indel), loss-of-function (LOF), and missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) was similar across all lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and similar to human populations in the gnomAD database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Karczewski et al. 2020</xref>). When we restricted our analysis to variants with a gnomAD allele frequency of &lt;0.001 and CADD phred score of &gt;30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang, McCarthy, and Stegle 2019</xref>), we observed a modest number of such potentially deleterious variants per cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2A</xref>). As the goal of iNDI is to model neurodegenerative diseases, we next examined WGS data for known pathogenic mutations in ADRD-associated genes. We identified heterozygous LOF variants in <italic>DRD4</italic> (rs587776842 in NN0003932 and NN0004297) and <italic>MPDZ</italic> (rs376078512 in KUCG3) but these were not the pathogenic homozygous state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nöthen et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shaheen et al. 2017</xref>). Next, we tested for the presence of genetic variants that have a strong to moderate association with ADRD. Specifically, we screened for variants in the AD risk gene <italic>APOE</italic> (rs429358 and rs7412), the frontotemporal dementia-associated variant rs3173615 in <italic>TMEM106B</italic>, and the <italic>MAPT</italic> haplotype rs180054 associated with risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We found that NCRM1 and NCRM5 carry the AD risk allele <italic>APOE</italic> E4 and identified variants in other genes known to be risk factors for ADRD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). Finally, we calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for all iPSC lines based on their cumulative burden of common genetic variants associated with AD or PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nalls et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kunkle et al. 2019</xref>) and found that their PRS falls within the expected range of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these findings show that the candidate sub-lines have relatively neutral genetic risk for ADRD.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CRISPR-based gene editing potential</title><p id="P14">As many groups will want to edit the genomes of the selected hiPSC sub-line, we next characterized the efficiency with which a SNV could be introduced.

Twenty-four edited clones from each sub-line were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons spanning the targeted site of the <italic>TIMP3</italic> locus to quantify frequency of six possible genotypes (WT/WT, WT/SNV, WT/indel, SNV/SNV, SNV/indel, and indel/indel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The overall editing efficiency of homozygous (SNV/SNV) was over 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also found that ratio of SNV/WT and SNV/SNV edits generated by homology directed repair (HDR) to indels generated from non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) varied across the sub-lines, with a higher frequency of WT/indel and SNV/indel clones observed in NN0003932 and NCRM1, respectively.</p><p id="P15">As CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks can lead to undesired editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Weisheit et al. 2020</xref>; Merkle, Neuhausser, et al. 2015) and because chromosomal abnormalities that confer growth advantage can be selected for in culture, we evaluated genomic fidelity of gene-edited clones using the NeuroChip DNA microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blauwendraat et al. 2017</xref>). Our WGS data confirmed that parental sub-lines were clearly genetically distinct as determined by pi-hat(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Purcell et al. 2007</xref>), except for clones NN0003932 and NN004297 derived from the same donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3A</xref>). We also found very high concordance across the genome (pi-hat &gt;0.986) when comparing gene-edited clones with their parental sub-lines using DNA microarray data, suggesting that the number of SNVs acquired during CRISPR editing was lower than the theoretical limit set by the call rates for this array (&gt;0.968; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3B</xref>). We then examined the microarray data to evaluate the frequency of large chromosomal abnormalities in the edited clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3B</xref>). From 185 edited clones, we identified 10 clones with chromosomal abnormalities, which involved chr12 (2 clones), chr20 (2 clones) or chr22 (6 clones). Clones derived from the KUCG3 sub-line had duplications of Chr12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3C</xref>) previously observed by karyotyping, suggesting the sub-line harbored mosaic variants at the time of gene editing. In contrast, the absence of this variant in any of the other sub-lines (181/185, 98%) support our earlier findings that sub-lines are karyotypically normal.</p><p id="P16">We also observed recurrent chr22 abnormalities in two homozygous edited clones of KOLF2.1J and one clone each of KUCG3, NCRM1, NN0003932 and PGP1. This abnormality represents copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) from the telomere to the region of chr22q12.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) containing the target of gene editing, <italic>TIMP3</italic>. Intrigued by this finding, we further explored the nature and frequency of genomic variants that emerge upon CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing by targeting additional genetic loci, as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Skarnes et al. 2021</xref>). We found that the majority (98%, 430/440 total) of clones tested lacked detectable acquired structural variants, in marked contrast to earlier reports that CN-LOH events can be common upon gene editing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Weisheit et al. 2020</xref>). Together, these results suggest that except for KUCG3, tested iPSC sub-lines do not contain mosaic populations of large genetic variants or readily acquire them upon gene editing.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Differentiation Potential</title><p id="P17">Since the generation of disease-relevant cell types is an important application of hiPSCs, we tested the ability of sub-lines to support cell differentiation, with an emphasis on the neural lineage. We tested four established protocols, two of which use small molecules and two of which were based on the overexpression of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Specifically, we directed the differentiation of iPSCs into either cortical or hypothalamic neurons and expressed either the transcription factor NGN2 to induce the formation of excitatory forebrain neurons (iNeuron, or hNGN2), or the transcription factors NGN2, ISL1, and LHX3 to induce the formation of lower motor neurons (iLowerMotorneurons, or hNIL). To assess differentiation efficiency, we profiled the differentiated cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing.</p><p id="P18">After quality control, demultiplexing and doublet removal, we obtained 12,818 cells from the hypothalamic protocol, 9,656 cells from the cortical protocol, 27,708 cells from the iNeuron protocol, and 18,008 cells from the iLowerMotorneurons protocol. As described above, cell sub-line identity was assigned to each cell using genotype information from the scRNA-seq reads. Louvain clustering revealed 17 clusters for hypothalamic differentiation and 13 clusters for the other 3 differentiations, which were then annotated using literature-curated genes indicative of cell identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4</xref>). We then grouped clusters into four categories based on their expression of indicative genes: target neuron, neurons, immature neurons, or progenitor/other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S4</xref>), and defined differentiation efficiency as the percentage of cells from each cell sub-line that gave rise to the target cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We found that across all four differentiation protocols, cell sub-lines consistently generated the target cell type but varied in their differentiation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S6E-H</xref>).

We removed LNGPI1 from consideration due to its unusual gene expression in the pluripotent state and poor differentiation properties. We also eliminated PGP1 due to possible residual expression of reprogramming factors suggested by GFP expression during FACS analysis, though we alert readers to the fact that other integration-free versions of this cell line exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee et al. 2009</xref>). Though all sub-lines were amenable to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of individual DNA bases, NN0003932 and NCRM1 showed relatively low gene editing efficiencies at the tested locus. Cell sub-lines KUCG3, NCRM5, and NN0004297 were amenable to gene editing and differentiated well but appeared to have slow growth kinetics relative to the other sub-lines, including KOLF2.1J. Consequently, since KOLF2.1J performed well across all tested assays, we selected it as a candidate reference iPSC sub-line.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>KOLF2.1J lacks genetic variants likely to cause neurological disease</title><p id="P21">We reasoned that any reference iPSC selected for large-scale studies should be extensively tested for the presence of genetic variants that might hinder the interpretation of molecular and cellular phenotypes in its differentiated progeny. First, we tested whether the process of editing <italic>ARID2</italic> in KOLF2.1J might have introduced unwanted mutations or culture adaptations. We therefore submitted both KOLF2.1J and the parental KOLF2-C1 line for 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing to generate phased genotyping data to complement our earlier 150 bp WGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then called high confidence and high quality SNV and indels and tested for variants that were rare (gnomAD allele frequency &lt; 0.001) or deleterious (CADD phred score &gt;30). Only 25 coding variants were observed in KOLF2.1J but not KOLF2-C1, and none of them were predicted to be rare or deleterious (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Analysis of ∼30x WGS data showed that the overall burden of potentially deleterious SNVs in KOLF2.1J was similar to that of other iPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We reasoned that combining two distinct short-read WGS datasets with the linked-read WGS dataset would enable us to filter out sequencing errors and increase our power to identify rare and potentially deleterious genetic variants. Indeed, this approach revealed 40 such variants in KOLF2.1J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2D</xref>). To gain insight into the origin of these variants, we manually reviewed sequencing data from the KOLF fibroblasts from which the KOLF-C1 parental line was derived and found that the vast majority of these variants (37/40, 93%) were already present in the donor fibroblasts and many of them were likely inherited form the germline. Other variants were only seen in a subset of sequencing reads, suggesting they arose as somatic mutations in a subset of the fibroblasts rather than during iPSC reprogramming, culture, or sub-cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rouhani et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To predict which of these variants might impact cellular phenotypes of KOLF2.1J or its differentiated progeny, we prioritised genes predicted to be loss-intolerant (score &lt; 0.03) by LoFtool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fadista et al. 2017</xref>) or listed as haploinsufficient in ClinGen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rehm et al. 2015</xref>). We observed variants in three such genes, including the previously described splice site disruption in <italic>COL3A1(</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hildebrandt et al. 2019</xref><italic>)</italic>, a gene that is associated with the vascular disease Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (OMIM 130050). Given the role of this gene in extracellular matrix (ECM) production, we speculate that the variant will not affect most neural cell types but urge caution if using KOLF2.1J to study cell lineages or co-culture systems that interact with the ECM. We also observed a truncating variant in the homeobox gene <italic>SHOX</italic> that is associated with short stature (OMIM 127300) and might alter cellular phenotypes in iPSC-derived skeletal cells, but likely not cells of the neural lineage. Finally, we observed a variant in the caspase-interacting gene <italic>DEDD</italic> that is not associated with human disease in OMIM. Together with G-band karyotyping and dGH data showing the absence of large structural variants, these findings suggest that the genome of KOLF2.1J does not harbor genetic variants that would substantially compromise the use of this sub-line for modeling neurological disease.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Distribution and community-based characterization of KOLF2.1J</title><p id="P24">To rigorously benchmark the performance of KOLF2.1J relative to other lines, we distributed it to groups who returned information on its growth and differentiation potential using independent approaches established in their laboratories.

Since we generated master banks of these cells prior to characterization in this study, users can be confident that distributed cell lines will have similar genetic and phenotypic properties. In addition to the cell line being readily obtainable, KOLF2.1J can be broadly used by academic groups since it was derived from material obtained under broad consent, and the accompanying material transfer agreement (MTA) is not burdensome. Our vision is that the deep genotypic and phenotypic characterization of this cell line, its proven performance in many laboratories, and its relative ease of distribution will lead to its widespread adoption by groups seeking to work with a trusted iPSC line to further the larger aim of improving reproducibility and collaboration in the field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Groups working with model organisms often found that results obtained on one genetic background did not replicate on another, and that the advantages of working on a common genetic background outweigh the inherent limitations of a particular strain. For example, despite its idiosyncrasies, the inbred C57Bl/6J sub-strain has become the mouse model of choice in laboratories around the world and is distributed by organizations that perform extensive quality control to prevent genetic drift. In comparison, human iPSCs were discovered recently({<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Takahashi 2007</xref>) and thousands of iPSC lines have been generated and used to model disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bennett et al. 2018</xref>), provide HLA-matched donors for cell transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Umekage, Sato, and Takasu 2019</xref>), and probe the functional effects of common genetic variants on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mitchell et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jerber et al. 2021</xref>). However, the use of iPSC lines has not yet been accompanied by the widespread adoption of a common reference line, likely due to a lack of knowledge about the lines that would enable their rational selection. While some studies have performed genetic analysis of large-scale collections of hESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Merkle et al. 2022</xref>) and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kilpinen et al. 2017</xref>), there are few studies that combine deep genetic and phenotypic characterization to support rational cell line selection. To address this issue, we sub-cloned cell lines to ensure they represented homogenous cell populations, and then expanded and banked them prior to deep characterization to ensure their genomic and phenotypic properties upon distribution would be similar to those reported in here.</p><p id="P29">We believe that KOLF2.1J is an excellent choice to become a commonly used iPSC line for several reasons. First, the parental KOLF2-C1 line was reprogrammed using non-integrating methods under feeder-free conditions in chemically defined media and substrates, and its provenance and ethical derivation are well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kilpinen et al. 2017</xref>).

Fourth, KOLF2.1J performed well across all tested assays we used. Fifth, to complement the international collaborative effort that went into the initial selection of KOLF2.1J, we used a “team science” approach to confirmed its strong performance in head-to-head competitions with iPSC lines established in nine other research groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, we established a pipeline to distribute KOLF2.1J and its derivatives (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/ipsc">https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/ipsc</ext-link>) to lower the regulatory and logistical hurdles that can frustrate the sharing of other cell lines.</p><p id="P31">Despite its good overall performance relative to other cell lines, we make no claims that KOLF2.1J is an ideal line for all purposes, just as no given individual (or strain of model organism) is free of defects. Each individual carries multiple loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Karczewski et al. 2020</xref>) and the fibroblasts from which KOLF2-C1 was derived had also acquired somatic mutations in genes including in <italic>ARID2</italic>, which was then corrected to produce KOLF2.1J. While the other variants we identified are of unclear potential significance, we anticipate that some groups may wish to introduce additional gene corrections to further improve the utility of KOLF2.1J. While we hope that many groups will see the value of a common reference line, which in this case is genetically male and of European ancestry, we simultaneously advocate for the establishment of other reference lines that are genetically female and/or derived from individuals of more diverse genetic ancestry. One such line might be the WTC11 due to its East Asian genetic background, established performance in gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Roberts et al. 2017</xref>) and CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tian et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">2019</xref>), and its presence of a potentially neuroprotective variant (rs1990621) in <italic>TMEM106B(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2020</xref>)</italic> that could be relevant to groups studying genetic modifiers of cellular vulnerability.

clonally-derived cell line that performs well across multiple modalities. KOLF2.1J was identified as a candidate reference cell line based on single-cell analysis of its gene expression in the pluripotent state, whole genome sequencing, genomic stability after highly efficient CRISPR-mediated gene editing, integrity of the p53 pathway, and the efficiency with which it differentiated into multiple target cell populations. Since it is deeply characterized and can be readily acquired, KOLF2.1J is an attractive reference cell line for groups working with iPSCs.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Growth, gene expression, and P53 pathway integrity of candidate cell sub-lines.</title><p>(A) Representative phase contrast photomicrographs of colony morphology of the eight iPSC sub-lines on day 3 after replating.
