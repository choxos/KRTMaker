This pathway is typically triggered by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Here we describe activation of ER stress via protein aggregation in the cell nucleus. We find in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) activation of ER stress due to the aggregation of the diseases-causing progerin protein at the nuclear envelope. The presence of nucleoplasmic protein aggregates is sensed and signaled to the ER lumen via immobilization and clustering of the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2, leading to activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). These results identify a nuclear trigger of ER stress and they provide insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of HGPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chaperones</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome</kwd><kwd>trans-membrane proteins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The cellular levels of proteins and their homeostasis in response to environmental cues are determined by a finely tuned balance between protein synthesis and degradation. In addition to regulated synthesis of proteins, several major cellular pathways are involved in the maintenance of the proteome, including the proteasomal system and autophagy, which are responsible for removal of damaged, misfolded and aggregated proteins from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, to ensure proper folding of nascent proteins and to prevent the accumulation of disease-causing aggregates, cells employ a repertoire of chaperones that resolubilize protein aggregates and assist in refolding of misfolded or unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ciechanover and Kwon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Saibil, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A prominent cellular mechanism of protein quality control involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of protein synthesis and folding of secreted and membrane-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Araki and Nagata, 2012</xref>). Stringent quality control systems in the lumen of the ER ensure that only correctly folded and functional proteins are released into the secretory pathway and that misfolded proteins are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhang and Ye, 2014</xref>). Proper functioning of the ER and its protein quality control mechanisms are essential for cellular activities and cell survival. Stimuli that interfere with ER function, such as hypoxia, aberrant calcium homeostasis, viral infections, or overproduction of secreted proteins, disrupt ER homeostasis and cause accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, resulting in ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lafleur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). ER transmembrane proteins, including inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF)-6 detect the onset of ER stress and initiate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathway to restore normal ER functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). Under physiological conditions, the activation of these sensors is inhibited by the binding of their luminal domains by the main ER-resident chaperone GRP78/BiP (78-kDa glucose-regulated protein). Due to its higher affinity to unfolded proteins compared to ER stress sensors, accumulated unfolded proteins cause the dissociation of GRP78/BiP from ER stress sensors and subsequent activation of the UPR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Corazzari et al., 2017</xref>). Prolonged ER stress caused by conditions that lead to increased secretory load or the presence of mutated proteins that cannot properly fold in the ER often result in cellular dysfunction and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chadwick and Lajoie, 2019</xref>). The UPR and ER stress have also been linked to physiological and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamczyk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Naturally occurring premature aging disorders are powerful model systems to study aging and aging-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kubben and Misteli, 2017</xref>).

The HGPS mutation activates a cryptic splice donor site in <italic>LMNA,</italic> resulting in the expression of progerin, a lamin A isoform that lacks 50 amino acids and permanently retains a C-terminal farnesyl group, leading to its stable association with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and predominant localization at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gonzalo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). Progerin acts in a dominant negative fashion and causes a variety of cellular defects including compromised nuclear architecture, heterochromatin maintenance, DNA repair, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as post-transcriptional reduction of select cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guilbert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mateos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pegoraro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Viteri et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, progerin has been shown to form static protein aggregates at the periphery of nuclei of patient-derived primary and immortalized fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kubben et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">McClintock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Vidak et al., 2015</xref>). Progerin aggregates are thought to be deleterious due to the entrapment of normal cellular proteins and compromising their function, including the anti-oxidative master regulator NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kubben et al., 2016b</xref>). Activation of autophagy through rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition has been shown to promote the solubilization and clearance of progerin and to alleviate cellular aging defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cao et al., 2011</xref>), indicating progerin aggregation as one of the drivers of HGPS etiology.</p><p id="P5">Here we have investigated the cellular chaperone response to the presence of progerin aggregates in HGPS. We find that progerin aggregates at the nuclear periphery promote clustering of the INM transmembrane protein SUN2, which in turn triggers sequestration of chaperones in the ER lumen via the SUN2 luminal domain, leading to induction of ER stress. These observations identify a novel activator of ER stress, a new mechanism of communication between the nucleus and the ER, and they provide insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of HGPS.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Progerin alters expression and localization of select molecular chaperones</title><p id="P6">The premature aging disorder HGPS is caused by the progerin protein, a mutant isoform of the nuclear intermediate filament protein lamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). Progerin is incorporated into the nuclear lamina and forms insoluble and static protein aggregates with low protein turnover dynamics both at the nuclear periphery and in the nuclear interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that the presence of progerin aggregates leads to activation of a cellular chaperone response.</p><p id="P7">To assess the effect of progerin on the expression and localization of major molecular chaperones, we performed biochemical and high-throughput imaging analysis to quantitatively determine protein levels and cellular distribution of several chaperones in the well-characterized cellular HGPS model system of hTERT-immortalized skin fibroblasts expressing doxycycline-inducible GFP-progerin and in HGPS patient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kubben et al., 2016a</xref>). Upon induction of GFP-progerin for 4 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>), which is sufficient to induce most major cellular defects associated with HGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pegoraro et al., 2009</xref>), the localization of Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 was unaffected by the presence of progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any changes in total protein levels of any of the chaperones at the population level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). However, single cell immunofluorescence analysis using high-throughput spinning-disc confocal microscopy revealed a 1.5 - 1.7-fold increase in average mean levels of Hsc70 and Hsp40 upon GFP-progerin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; P = 0.0077 and P = 0.019, respectively). No significant change in the levels of Hsp90 and Hsp110 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Similar observations were made in immortalized HGPS patient skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>), although the increase is less prominent due to the previously described heterogeneity of progerin expression in the patient-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Vidak et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, despite unchanged Hsp110 levels, confocal microscopy revealed accumulation of Hsp110 around the nuclei of GFP-progerin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, arrows) and in patient skin fibroblasts with a staining pattern resembling of the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>; arrows).

These luminal aggregates activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which alters the expression of numerous genes involved in ER quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, ER stress can result in widespread cytoplasmic protein aggregation and generate proteotoxic stress responses across cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hamdan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rao and Bredesen, 2004</xref>). Given the observed increase in the levels of Hsc70 and Hsp40 chaperones and the accumulation of Hsp110 at the ER in progerin-expressing cells, we sought to determine whether progerin expression causes ER stress by measuring UPR activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p id="P9">Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed transcriptional activation of several UPR genes, including DDIT3, HSPA5, XBP1 and ERN1/IRE1 upon induction of GFP-progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The same increase was observed in multiple immortalized and primary HGPS patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamczyk et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, induction of these genes was a specific response to the presence of progerin and did not occur upon expression of wild type lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These changes represented physiological responses as they were also present in the heart and aorta of homo- and heterozygous progerin transgenic HGPS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Varga et al., 2006</xref>) and a homozygous knock-in HGPS mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Osorio et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), in line with earlier observations of UPR upregulation in an atherosclerosis-prone HGPS mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamczyk et al., 2019</xref>). These results were confirmed by single-cell high-throughput imaging which demonstrated a significant increase in the mean protein levels for several ER chaperones including PDI, calnexin, GRP78 and GRP94 in inducible progerin-expressing fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), and a moderate increase in immortalized patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In line with the well established heterogeneity of cellular phenotypes in HGPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Vidak et al., 2018</xref>) single-cell analysis revealed high heterogeneity of expression within the cell population, as well as between biological replicates in HGPS patient cells, with 10-40% of cells showing increase in the expression relative to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). The same pattern was observed in several primary HGPS patient-derived fibroblasts, with 10-40% cells showing increase in GRP78 and PDI, and up to 80% increase in Calnexin and GRP94 expression levels relative to control (WT 1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis demonstrated increased phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1α, two major mediators of the UPR pathway, in the presence of progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We conclude that progerin triggers ER stress pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Chronic activation of ER stress in HGPS cells</title><p id="P10">Elevated levels of ER chaperones and transcriptional activation of the UPR genes are typically associated with a heightened ER stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Halperin et al., 2014</xref>). To assess whether the progerin-mediated increase in key ER stress response factors affects the ability of cells to respond to stress, we challenged progerin-expressing cells with the ER stressors Thapsigargin or Tunicamycin. Remarkably, while control cells were able to significantly upregulate UPR genes progerin-expressing cells failed to respond to additional ER stress above their elevated baseline level of UPR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>). These results suggest that progerin chronically activates ER stress response pathways to a level that prevents further activation upon additional stressors.</p><p id="P11">Previous studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress, can significantly relieve ER stress and reduce ER stress-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Choi et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Choi et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Uppala et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Treatment of GFP-progerin inducible cells with 25 μM TUDCA for 48h significantly increased cell number in comparison to vehicle treated control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>) but had no effect on progerin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>) nor total GRP78 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>), consistent with a role of ER stress in progerin-mediated cell death, one of the major HGPS cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Vidak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Together with recent findings demonstrating beneficial effects of TUDCA on vascular phenotype and lifespan of atherosclerosis-prone progeria mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamczyk et al., 2019</xref>), our data suggest a contribution of ER stress to the development of the HGPS phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Progerin aggregates sequester ER chaperones at the nuclear periphery</title><p id="P12">To investigate the mechanism by which the nuclear protein progerin induces ER stress, we probed the distribution of several ER chaperones in progerin-expressing cells using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We find accumulation of GRP78/BiP and PDI in ER regions immediately juxtaposed to the nuclear periphery, mirroring the distribution of progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Quantification of single-cell high-throughput imaging of GRP78/BiP distribution shows significant recruitment to the nuclear periphery in both GFP-progerin expressing and patient-derived fibroblasts, as assessed by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of a band of 5-35% distance from the nucleus, where 0% is adjacent to DAPI and 100% represents the cell border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Progerin-C661S, in contrast to progerin, does not lead to significant GRP78/BiP sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>) nor to the induction of UPR signaling or increased levels of ER chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, I</xref>).

However, direct interaction between progerin and ER chaperones is unlikely since progerin does not extend into the perinuclear space, pointing to the existence of adaptor proteins that sense and transmit the presence of nucleoplasmic progerin aggregates to the ER lumen. Because the ER lumen is contiguous with the perinuclear space between the INM and outer nuclear membrane (ONM), we hypothesized that the INM proteins SUN1 and SUN2 may mediate the nuclear-triggered ER stress response by transmitting the activating signal across the INM into the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). SUN1 and SUN2 are transmembrane proteins whose N-terminus interacts with the nuclear lamin proteins, including progerin, on the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope, whereas their highly conserved luminal C-terminus extends into the perinuclear space where it interacts with nesprin transmembrane proteins located in the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Haque et al., 2010</xref>).

Stimulated emission depleted (STED) super-resolution microscopy reveled that SUN2 proteins are not uniformly localized at the nuclear periphery but accumulate in cluster-like structures in the INM in the presence of progerin but not of wild type lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, arrows). Interestingly, SUN2 clusters coincide with the highest levels of GRP78/BiP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, arrows). The accumulation of SUN2 was not merely a reflection of higher local levels of progerin, since the ratio of SUN2 relative to progerin increased compared to wild type lamin A, pointing to local enrichment of SUN2 in the presence of progerin aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly, GRP78/BiP was enriched at sites of SUN2 clusters induced by progerin aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>), indicating recruitment of GRP78/BiP in the INM lumen to the newly formed SUN2 clusters.</p><p id="P18">The requirement for SUN2 in activation of the luminal ER stress response combined with the observed local clustering of SUN2 and the accumulation of GRP78/BiP at SUN2 clusters suggests a mechanistic model in which SUN2 senses the density of lamin A/progerin on the nucleoplasmic side of the INM and transmits this information to the ER lumen via its clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). In this model SUN2 detects the presence of progerin aggregates via its known interaction of its nucleoplasmic N-terminus with progerin, while SUN2 clustering is sensed in the ER lumen by interaction of GRP78/BiP with the clustered SUN2 C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). This model predicts that forced clustering of SUN2 in the absence of progerin aggregates should be sufficient to recruit GRP78/BiP to SUN2 clusters in the ER and that this accumulation should be dependent on the C-terminal domain of SUN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). To test these predictions, we developed an optimized optogenetic clustering approach based on the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CRY2-derived optogenetic module CRY2olig, which induces rapid and robust protein oligomerization upon exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Taslimi et al., 2014</xref>). Several SUN2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) were fused to CRY2olig-mCherry and expressed under the control of either a strong CMV promoter or a ubiquitin promoter for moderate to low expression. As expected based on prior observations on SUN2 localization upon exogenous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>), high level expression of wild-type SUN2 or mutants that contained the transmembrane domain and either the complete (SUN2-C) or partial luminal domain (SUN2-N-1) resulted in the formation of cluster-like structures even in the absence of light induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>). Interestingly, line scan analysis by confocal microscopy revealed accumulation of GRP78/BiP at these SUN2 clusters, with the most prominent accumulation at clusters of SUN2-C containing the full luminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C, D, E</xref>).

In line with the ability of clustered SUN2 to trigger ER stress responses, GRP78/BiP accumulated strongly at light-induced SUN2 clusters at the nuclear periphery in the absence of progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D, E</xref>; top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>), recapitulating the phenotype observed in progerin-expressing cells. To demonstrate that it is the clustering of the luminal portion of SUN2 that promotes GRP78/BiP sequestration, we optogenetically induced clustering of SUN2-N-1 and SUN2-N-2 variants, which lack part or all of the luminal domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These mutants clustered more readily than full-length SUN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>, panels 3 and 4), most likely due to significantly smaller sizes of these proteins (260 aa and 226 aa, respectively, in comparison to 717 aa for the full length SUN2). Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) analysis shows very little recovery of induced clusters with the recovery rate of 0.086 +/- 0.0075 s-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>).

These data demonstrate that the entire luminal portion of the SUN2 protein is necessary and part of the luminal domain are sufficient for the recruitment of the GRP78/BiP to the nuclear periphery. Interestingly, clustering of a construct consisting of the nucleoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SUN2 fused to the luminal domain of SUN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>, panel 5) still efficiently recruits GRP78 to the induced clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G, H, I</xref>), suggesting that GRP78/BiP recognition of clusters is sequence-independent.</p><p id="P20">To finally show that the peripheral recruitment of the GRP78/BiP leads to the activation of the UPR response, we enriched mCherry positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B and C</xref>) and performed qRT-PCR analysis of UPR genes upon optogenetic clustering of SUN2 variants (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>). Optogenetically-induced clustering was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis prior to qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C and D</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis showed transcriptional activation of several UPR genes, including DDIT3, ERN1/IRE1 and EIF2AK3 upon induction of SUN2-N-1 clusters (1.5 − 1.9-fold increase), whereas clustering of the SUN2-N-2 variant completely lacking the C-terminal luminal domain did not further increase expression of UPR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7E</xref>).

We find that the INM transmembrane protein SUN2 senses the aggregation of the disease-causing progerin protein at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope and transmits this information to the ER lumen to trigger the UPR. These findings reveal an unanticipated pathway of communication between the nucleus and the ER and they provide insights into the molecular disease mechanisms of HGPS.</p><p id="P22">ER stress response pathways, including the UPR, are triggered by the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>). The UPR is activated when the major ER-resident chaperone GRP78/BiP dissociates from the major UPR transducers IRE1α, PERK and ATF6 and binds to unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). The UPR can be triggered by numerous stimuli including redox disruption, hypoxia, aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, energy balance disruption, viral infections, overproduction of secreted/transmembrane proteins, secretion of folding-incompetent mutated proteins, as well as a number of xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lafleur et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations expand these mechanisms of UPR activation by demonstrating that ER stress pathways can also be triggered by nucleoplasmic protein aggregates at the periphery of the nucleus. We show that the transmembrane INM protein SUN2 senses progerin aggregates juxtaposed to the nuclear envelope via interactions of its N-terminus with progerin, leading to SUN2 clustering in the INM. Analogous to typical UPR activation, clustering of SUN2 is then sensed by GRP78/BiP in the perinuclear space, which is contiguous with the ER lumen, via recognition of the C-terminal luminal regions of SUN2, thus triggering the UPR pathway. This signaling axis represents a novel mechanism of ER stress activation induced by a nuclear trigger. Whether other nuclear proteins can trigger similar ER stress by the same or related mechanisms remains to be determined.</p><p id="P23">Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that clustering of the luminal portion of SUN2 induces recruitment of the GRP78/BiP to SUN2 clusters and activation of the UPR response. First, artificial clustering by optogenetic methods of the full length SUN2 or a SUN2 N-terminus variant that still contains a portion of the C-terminus is sufficient to promote GRP78/BiP sequestration and transcriptional activation of several UPR genes. Second, overexpression of the SUN2 C-terminus which consists of the luminal and transmembrane domain of SUN2 induces pronounced cluster-like structures which very efficiently recruit GRP78/BiP, similar to the high-density aggregates observed in progerin expressing cells. Third, optogenetic clustering of a SUN2 variant which completely lacks the C-terminal luminal domain does not recruit GRP78/BiP and does not induce transcriptional activation of UPR genes, in contrast to full length SUN2 or SUN2-N-1 induced clusters. The observation that SUN2-N-1 variant containing only a small portion of the luminal domain (34aa) still efficiently recruits GRP78/BiP demonstrates that GRP78/BiP recognition of clusters is a sequence-independent effect, as confirmed by clustering the construct consisting of nucleoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SUN2 fused to the luminal domain of SUN1.</p><p id="P24">Our results document a communication pathway between the nuclear interior and the ER lumen and as such establish a new mechanism of inter-compartment communication. We identify the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 as a mediator of this communication. SUN2, together with SUN1, is a member of the SUN (Sad1p, Unc-84) domain family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Malone et al., 1999</xref>) which share a conserved SUN domain at their luminal C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tzur et al., 2006</xref>), at least one transmembrane domain and a less characterized N-terminus which interacts with the nuclear lamin A protein on the nucleoplasmic face of the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Haque et al., 2010</xref>). SUN proteins interact in the lumen of the nuclear envelope with the outer nuclear membrane KASH (Klarsicht, Anc-1, Syne-1 homology) domain proteins to form the core of the LINC complex involved in connecting the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). As such, the LINC complex plays an important role in mechanotransduction, nuclear migration, cell polarity, cytoskeletal organization, meiotic chromosome movement and protein recruitment to the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings expand the mode of action of SUN proteins by demonstrating that SUN2 does not only function via interaction with the KASH-domains in nesprins. Whether the interaction of SUN2 with GRP78/BiP in the presence of progerin reflects an amplification of more sporadically occurring binding events in a non-disease state or whether the interaction is specifically triggered under pathological conditions by the presence of progerin remains to be determined.</p><p id="P25">The ability of SUN2 to sense the aggregation of progerin is based on its intrinsic propensity to interact with nuclear lamins as part of the LINC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Haque et al., 2010</xref>).

The presence of these nucleoplasmic, membrane proximal aggregates results in abnormal clustering of SUN2 and activation of ER stress responses. In addition to the interaction of the SUN2 nuclear domain with lamins, clustering is likely also facilitated by the intrinsically low mobility of SUN proteins in the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Our finding that SUN2 acts as a sensor of nuclear protein aggregates, transmits the signal to the ER, and activates stress response pathways to restore homeostasis describes a new function for a protein in the LINC complex.</p><p id="P26">Sustained ER stress and a faulty UPR response have been linked to physiological aging, as well as to many aging-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Brown and Naidoo, 2012</xref>).

Emission bandpass filters were used for each channel: 445/45, 525/50, 600/37, and 690/29 nm. Nine randomly selected fields of view were imaged per well in a single optimal focal plane. Images were corrected on the fly using a geometric correction for camera background, illumination field (vignetting), camera alignment, and chromatic aberrations. Corrected images were saved and stored as 16-bit TIFF files. Captured images were then analyzed using Columbus 2.8.1 or 2.9.1 (Perkin Elmer). Briefly, nuclei regions of interest (ROI) were segmented using the DAPI (405 nm) channel and cytoplasmic based ROIs were segmented using the CellMask HCS channel (640 nm). Cytoplasm and nucleus ROIs adjacent to the image edges were excluded from subsequent image analysis steps. The mean fluorescence intensity for the nucleus and cytoplasmic ROI was measured in the 561 nm channel. Analysis of the recruitment of GRP78/BiP to the nuclear periphery was done by creating a ring ROI covering 5-35% of the distance from the DAPI-based nuclear ROI (where 0% is adjacent to DAPI and 100% represents the cell border) and the mean fluorescence intensity per well for ring ROI was measured in 561nm channel.
