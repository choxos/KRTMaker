Integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n=690), we find that clinical mitochondrial disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed <italic>hypermetabolism</italic>. In a longitudinal cellular model of primary patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors, we show that genetic and pharmacological disruptions of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) similarly trigger increased energy consumption in a cell-autonomous manner, despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency. Hypermetabolism is associated with mtDNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response, increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15, as well as an accelerated rate of telomere erosion and epigenetic aging, and a reduced Hayflick limit. Together with these dynamic measures, we have generated a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations in response to OxPhos dysfunction. The increased energetic cost of living, or hypermetabolism, in cells and organisms with OxPhos defects has important biological and clinical implications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mitochondrial disorders</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd><kwd>energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>GDF15</kwd><kwd>cell-free mitochondrial DNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial (mtDNA) or nuclear (nDNA) genomes, which impair oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and the ability to convert food substrates into ATP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, cellular dysfunction arises even when ATP levels are normal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, suggesting that energy deficiency may not be the primary disease initiator. In animal models, OxPhos defects trigger nuclear transcriptional responses, including the integrated stress response (ISR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and downstream gene products such as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) are secreted systemically where they impact metabolic functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This implicates conserved systemic signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Considering that these stress pathways entail fundamentally energetically demanding cellular processes, OxPhos defects could therefore increase energy consumption at the cellular and organismal levels. However, the metabolic costs of cellular and systemic recalibrations in mitochondrial disorders have not been defined. Here we examine this question in clinical datasets and in two <italic>in vitro</italic> models.</p><p id="P3">Clinically, OxPhos dysfunction causes a broad spectrum of multi-system disorders where symptoms include, among others, fatigue and exercise intolerance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. As a result, most patients with mitochondrial diseases curtail physical activity and exercise <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. A common misconception arising from this clinical picture is that a reduced mitochondrial capacity to oxidize substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> coupled to minimal physical activity levels would promote an energy conservation response, resulting in positive energy balance and body fat accumulation, leading to obesity. However, patients with mitochondrial diseases are rarely obese. In fact, patients with moderate to severe disease on average classify as underweight <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Although gastro-intestinal symptoms that limit food intake or absorption could contribute to this phenotype, the rarity of obesity in mitochondrial disease remains a clinical paradox. This may be resolved by the counterintuitive notion that mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction may not decrease energy consumption and expenditure but may rather <italic>increase</italic> the energetic cost required to sustain basic physiological functions.</p><p id="P4">Living organisms avoid thermodynamic decay to grow and survive by consuming energy. The amount of energy expended relative to the minimal metabolic rate required to sustain life is defined as <italic>metabolic efficiency</italic>. Strong evolutionary pressures have optimized metabolic efficiency in organisms, thereby minimizing the amount of ATP required to sustain life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. One evolutionary strategy includes the choice of metabolic pathways to derive ATP (OxPhos vs glycolysis), which have different ATP yields and metabolic costs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Within cells, metabolic costs arise mainly from transcription/translation processes (~60% of total energy demands), the maintenance of ionic balance, as well as organelle biogenesis and degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which includes mitochondrial turnover. Mitochondrial biogenesis comes at a substantial cost because of the extensive mitochondrial proteome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In mitochondrial diseases, the intracellular heterogeneous mixture of mitochondria with mutant and wild-type mtDNA (i.e., heteroplasmy) triggers exaggerated biogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, a phenomenon predicted to increase the basal metabolic cost of organelle maintenance and total energy expenditure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Accordingly, a re-analysis of resting energy expenditure (REE) in animal models of mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction is elevated by 15-85%, including in Crif1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with impaired mitochondrial translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, Clpp<sup>-/-</sup> mice with deficient proteostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, Polg mutator mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, ANT1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with impaired ATP/ADP exchange <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and <italic>ATP6-</italic>mutant flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, reasoning from thermodynamics principles, impaired OxPhos capacity may impede the natural and optimal balance of energy transformation pathways, consequently reducing metabolic efficiency. Therefore, we reasoned that patients with severe OxPhos defects would similarly exhibit impaired metabolic efficiency and increased REE – a state known as <italic>hypermetabolism</italic>. Other causes of OxPhos dysfunction including mutations in nuclear genes encoding respiratory chain assembly factors like <italic>SURF1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, which cause disease and decrease lifespan in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, could also trigger hypermetabolism.</p><p id="P5">Shortened lifespan is a ubiquitous feature of mitochondrial diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and most animal models with severe OxPhos dysfunction die prematurely <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. But is there a causal link between hypermetabolism and lifespan in humans? Among healthy individuals, elevated REE or hypermetabolism measured by indirect calorimetry (oxygen consumption, VO<sub>2</sub>) predicts more rapid age-related physiological decline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and independently predicts 25-53% higher mortality over the following 20-40 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> – an effect double that incurred by smoking cigarettes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In human stem cells, hypermetabolism was also correlated with senescence and other aging phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, multiple processes compete for limited energetic resources within cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, particularly under energy-restricted conditions. Because some cellular operations are prioritized over others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the energetic cost of stress responses and their associated increase in transcription/translation can inhibit growth and cell division, even triggering premature senescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Recently, it was reported that excessive activation of the ISR itself inhibits cell population growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, OxPhos-induced ISR activation and the resulting hypermetabolism could curtail growth and/or cause premature death by forcing an energetic tradeoff between stress responses and growth/survival pathways.</p><p id="P6">Taken together, the observations that: i) genetic mitochondrial OxPhos defects trigger integrated stress responses, ii) cells operate under energetic constraints where the prioritization of stress responses and transcription/translation costs can precipitate senescence, and iii) decreased metabolic efficiency predicts shorter lifespan in humans and other animals, lead to the following hypothesis: genetic defects causing OxPhos dysfunction trigger hypermetabolism both physiologically and cell-autonomously, a phenotype associated with reduced lifespan.</p><p id="P7">Here we test this hypothesis by re-analyzing data from multiple clinical cohorts of primary mitochondrial diseases with direct and indirect assessments of energy expenditure and lifespan, and via longitudinal <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in patient-derived human fibroblasts. We have developed a cellular system that provides high temporal resolution, repeated-measures of bioenergetic and multi-omic molecular recalibrations across the cellular lifespan. Using this model, we show that both genetic and pharmacological mitochondrial OxPhos defects trigger marked hypermetabolism in a cell-autonomous manner. We identify mtDNA instability, activation of the ISR, increased secretory activity, and transcriptional upregulation of transcriptional/translational stress pathways as potential contributors to hypermetabolism. Finally, we report that OxPhos defects and hypermetabolism are linked to accelerated telomere shortening and epigenetic aging in fibroblasts, and provide a publicly available longitudinal dataset to query epigenetic and transcriptional signatures conserved across both cellular models. Our analyses highlight how the associated resource dataset can serve as a discovery platform to identify potentially targetable pathways contributing to hypermetabolism, as well as downstream mechanisms linking hypermetabolism to cellular and clinical phenotypes. Together, these translational data implicate hypermetabolism as a pathophysiological feature of mitochondrial diseases and lifespan reduction.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Meta-analysis of metabolic rate and physiology in primary mitochondrial disease</title><p id="P8">To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial OxPhos defects are associated with increased energy expenditure and shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), we integrated and re-analyzed data from a total of 17 cohorts representing a total of 690 patients with mitochondrial diseases and 225 healthy controls (provided by the authors or directly from publications) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The heterogenous mixture of functional and dysfunctional mitochondria within single cells is well known to cause mitochondrial hyperproliferation and increase mtDNA copy number <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, as illustrated within a single patient skeletal muscle cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. Increased biogenesis must naturally incur increased energy expenditure at the cellular level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which we reasoned may translate to elevated whole-body REE.</p><p id="P9">In patients with mitochondrial diseases, resting heart rate, which correlates with whole-body REE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, was on average 10.7% higher than healthy controls (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This tachycardia reached up to +46% when patients and controls performed mild exercise at the same absolute workload (data not shown). Both at rest and during mild physical activity, as initially reported in a small study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, patients had on average 244% higher blood or urine catecholamine levels (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), particularly norepinephrine (NE), a neurohormone sufficient to elevate REE when administered systemically to healthy individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. To estimate REE in mitochondrial disease patients, we used resting whole body VO<sub>2</sub> expressed relative to body weight, which, although imperfect, was available in the largest number of studies. Strikingly, VO<sub>2</sub> measured by indirect calorimetry across 6 cohorts of patients with mtDNA defects was on average 30% higher at rest (p&lt;0.0001) than in healthy controls, a difference characterized by a very large effect size (Hedge’s g=2.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). REE estimates using the Weir equation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (combining both VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>, readily available in 3/6 cohorts) yielded equivalent results within 1.2% of the group difference derived from VO<sub>2</sub> alone. Notably, VO<sub>2</sub> was elevated by more than half (+51%) during mild physical activity in mitochondrial diseases, consistent with hyperkinetic cardiocirculatory responses to exercise in this population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, these gross body mass normalized REE values reveal increased energy consumption (i.e., lower metabolic efficiency) in mitochondrial diseases, at rest and particularly during mild physical challenges.</p><p id="P10">The increase in REE is particularly striking given that patients with mitochondrial diseases on average have lower muscle mass <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, which is the major site of activity-dependent energy consumption. Therefore, the lower muscle mass in patients would be expected to reduce energy expenditure, unless the tissues intrinsically exhibited impaired metabolic efficiency, and thus consumed more energy per unit time just to sustain homeostasis. Therefore, the meta-analysis of these clinical data from multiple cohorts combining hundreds of patients reveals an increased energetic cost of living per unit of body mass – or <italic>hypermetabolism</italic> – in mitochondrial diseases.</p><p id="P11">Physiologically, hypermetabolism is expected to produce a negative energy balance, expending more energy substrates than are ingested, generally preventing the accumulation of body fat. Accordingly, body mass index (BMI), a gross estimate of adiposity, was on average 9.8% lower (p&lt;0.05) patients with mitochondrial diseases compared to controls (23% lower than national averages across 3 countries) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). In one study, fat mass index, a more precise indicator of body fat, was 21.9% lower in mitochondrial disease patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, although not all patients are thin, patients with more severe disease manifestations tended to have lower BMI (r=-0.25, p=0.018) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that more severe mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction in humans contribute to prevent the accumulation of body fast and obesity. Again, this result is in line with those in animal models of OxPhos defects, which similarly show hypermetabolism and reduced adiposity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">This clinical picture of mitochondrial diseases marked by increased REE and reduced body fat was associated with a 3-4-decade reduction in lifespan among adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In a 10-year longitudinal observational study from the UK, peak mortality in mixed genetic diagnoses of mitochondrial diseases occurs up to 3 decades earlier than the national reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). In children with severe pediatric forms of mitochondrial diseases, including diseases caused by autosomal recessive respiratory chain defects (e.g., <italic>SURF1</italic> mutations: median lifespan 5.4 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>), lifespan can be reduced by &gt;90%. Heterogeneity between genetic diagnoses also highlights possible mutation-specific effects on hypermetabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). Together, these multimodal physiological data establish hypermetabolism as a clinical feature of mitochondrial diseases, which could account for the rarity of obesity and also contribute to shortened lifespan in this population.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Longitudinal analysis of primary human fibroblasts with SURF1 mutations</title><p id="P13">To examine if mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction alters the REE and lifespan in a cell-autonomous manner independent of clinical, medical, and socio-behavioral confounds, we next performed a longitudinal study of primary human fibroblasts with genetically defined or pharmacologically induced OxPhos dysfunction. We used cells with a stable nuclear mutation in <italic>SURF1</italic> (Surfeit Locus Protein 1), which causes partial mis-assembly and dysfunction of respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, COX) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, leading to Leigh syndrome and death in early childhood (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Primary dermal fibroblasts were obtained from 3 patients with <italic>SURF1</italic> mutations presenting with Leigh syndrome, and from 3 healthy donors with no known mitochondrial dysfunction (<italic>Control</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">2</xref>). Each group included one female and two male donors.

These data therefore add to previous evidence in HEK293 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, providing a robust platform for discovering conserved nuclear DNAm signatures associated with hypermetabolism-causing OxPhos defects in primary human cells.</p><p id="P38">At the single CpG level, we asked which differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were stably and consistently either hypo- or hypermethylated in both SURF1 or Oligo-treated cells relative to control. Because transcriptionally relevant DNAm changes may operate across multiple CpGs, we complemented this approach by systematically examining differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which include multiple nearby CpGs exhibiting similar hypo- or hypermethylated changes in our statistical model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref> for details). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the overlap in significant DMPs and DMRs (threshold FDR&lt;0.05). Of the overlapping DMPs between SURF1 and Oligo, 14.8% were hypermethylated, and 45.9% were hypomethylated. Global hypomethylation is a feature of human aging and replicative senescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. For DMRs, the corresponding proportions were 11.1% and 46.6%, showing high agreement in the methylome recalibrations between DMPs and DMRs approaches. A notable number of significant and highly differentially methylated changes in either SURF1 or Oligo-treated cells were specific to each condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Files 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">10</xref>), but here we focus exclusively on the changes conserved across two independent models, which therefore have the highest probability of being specifically caused by OxPhos dysfunction and associated with hypermetabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The most robust changes in DNA methylation were targeted at CpG islands near or on gene bodies.

A stringent analysis of the most differentially methylated genes (based on both DMSs and DMRs) showed strong enrichment for processes involving: i) development and morphogenesis, ii) regulation of cell-cell signaling and organismal communication, iii) neural development, and iv) cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). As highlighted above, increased regulation of signaling and communication, along with development and morphogenesis, must entail energetically dependent processes. These data, supported by the activation of corresponding downstream transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) and the observed hypersecretory phenotype in OxPhos-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), document genome-wide epigenomic recalibrations consistent <italic>not</italic> with energy conservation, but with increased total energy expenditure. These data also can be further queried with specific genomic targets in mind.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>RC dysfunction accelerates telomere shortening and decreases lifespan</title><p id="P40">Finally, given the deleterious effect of hypermetabolism-causing OxPhos defects on the lifespan of patients with mitochondrial diseases and in animal models, these genome-wide data prompted us to examine how OxPhos dysfunction and hypermetabolism relate to dynamic genomic markers of cellular aging and senescence. The complete population doubling curves of each donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>) provided initial evidence that cellular lifespan was reduced in SURF1 and Oligo-treated cells. The Hayflick limit (i.e., total number of cell divisions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>) was on average 53% lower in SURF1 cells (p=0.072, g=2.0), and Oligo decreased the Hayflick limit by 40% (p&lt;0.066 g=2.0) relative to the untreated cells of the same donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A-B</xref>). Interestingly, the magnitude of these effects (40-53%) on total population doubling loosely corresponds to the 3-4-decade loss in human lifespan documented among adults with mitochondrial diseases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>), which would represent 38-50% for an average 80-year life expectancy.</p><p id="P41">To directly measure the pace of biological aging in response to OxPhos defects, we performed repeated measures of telomere length across the cellular lifespan. This allowed us to compute the average <italic>rate</italic> (i.e. slope) of telomere shortening per population doubling or cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consistent with observations of dramatically shortened telomeres in skeletal muscle of patients with mtDNA mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> and recent work causally linking mitochondrial dysfunction to telomere dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, both SURF1 mutations and Oligo treatment strikingly increased the rate of telomere erosion per population doubling by 162% for SURF1 (p=0.53, g=3.2) and 769% for Oligo (p=0.09, g=1.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). This means that for each cell division, OxPhos-deficient fibroblasts lose 1.6-7.7 times more telomeric repeats than healthy fibroblasts. We note that these results rely on the estimated slope across the whole cellular lifespan (single value per donor, n=3 per group) so the p values are less meaningful than the effect sizes, which are large (g&gt;1). The terminal telomere length coinciding with growth arrest tended to be moderately higher in SURF1 and Oligo groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). This could suggest that growth arrest is driven by factors other than absolute telomere length, such as the prioritization of transcription/translation over growth-related functions, which are sufficient to induce growth arrest and senescence in human fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P42">Next, we leveraged our DNAm dataset to quantify biological age using validated multivariate algorithms or “clocks” (DNAmAge, or epigenetic clocks) trained, in human tissues, to predict chronological age and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. Five different validated clocks that rely on different CpG sets and include a modification that improves their accuracy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> were applied directly to our fibroblast time series DNAm data. These results showed that relative to the rate of epigenetic aging in control cells with normal OxPhos function, the rates of biological aging per population doubling were accelerated by an average of 131% in SURF1 cells (p&lt;0.05, g=1.5), and to a lesser extent in Oligo-treated cells (+54%, p&lt;0.05, g=0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F-G</xref>), thus independently supporting the findings of accelerated telomere shortening.

A major advantage of our cellular system is that it isolates the stable influence of genetic and pharmacological OxPhos perturbations on energy expenditure, independent of other factors that may operate <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, these data establish the cell-autonomous nature of hypermetabolism. Moreover, despite the diverging mode of action of SURF1 and Oligo models, as well as some divergent molecular features, both models converge on the same hypermetabolic phenotype, adding confidence around the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our data also rule out mitochondrial uncoupling as a main driver of hypermetabolism in this system, and instead implicate the activation of energy-demanding gene regulatory programs, including but likely not limited to increased metabokine/cytokine secretion, that can compete with growth and longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Our resource cellular lifespan data provide several novel observations that agree with previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>, and that are relevant to understanding how primary mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction triggers some of the physiological and phenotypic hallmarks of aging and mitochondrial diseases.</p><p id="P45">First, we observed that the mitochondrial disease marker GDF15 was largely undetectable in the media of young, healthy fibroblasts, but increased progressively across the cellular lifespan. This finding recapitulates the age-related increase in GDF15 in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, and adds to previous evidence of conserved age-related changes in DNA methylation in primary human fibroblasts cultured over several months <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Consistent with the higher GDF15 levels in primary OxPhos disorders in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, extracellular GDF15 tended to be elevated in both models of OxPhos dysfunction. Likewise, OxPhos dysfunction increased extracellular cf-mtDNA levels, in line with recent reports that cf-mtDNA is elevated in primary OxPhos disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and with aging in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. The link between OxPhos dysfunction and cf-mtDNA release requires further investigation.</p><p id="P46">Second, we observed that OxPhos dysfunction from <italic>SURF1</italic> mutations, and to a lesser extent Oligo treatment, both caused secondary mtDNA instability. mtDNA instability was associated with the variable accumulation of mtDNA deletions, but not point mutations, across the cellular lifespan. Our confidence in this result is reinforced by the longitudinal nature of the mtDNA sequencing data, from the same primary cell lines examined at multiple time points. Notably, the time course data also showed that cell populations can eliminate a large fraction of mtDNA deletions within 12-14 days (mtDNA deletions are removed from one passage to the next). This is consistent with the fact that replicating fibroblasts eliminate some deleterious mtDNA deletions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, and also that several <italic>de novo</italic> deletions removed the origin of replication of the light strand (O<sub>L</sub>), thereby preventing their replication. Whether the clonal amplification of some mtDNA deletions in SURF1 fibroblasts occurs through population selection at the cellular level, or through intracellular quality control mechanisms, or a combination of both, remains to be determined.</p><p id="P47">Third, mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction dramatically increased the telomere erosion rate per cell division, despite the adaptive transcriptional upregulation of telomere protection complex components. This effect of mitochondria on telomeres agrees with the variable telomere maintenance in mtDNA conplastic mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>, with the life-shortening effect of pathogenic mtDNA variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and OxPhos dysfunction in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and with the reduced lifespan in patients with mtDNA disease shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>. A study in skeletal muscle of children with high heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations also reported excessively short telomeres, similar in length to the telomeres of healthy 80 year old controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Because skeletal muscle is a post-mitotic tissue, this previous result also implies that OxPhos dysfunction could accelerate telomere attrition at a disproportionate rate, or perhaps independent from cell division, as suggested by the disconnect between the loss of telomeric repeats and genome replication/cell division observed in our hypermetabolic fibroblasts. Beyond severe OxPhos defects, mild alterations of OxPhos function driven by mild, common variants in complex I subunits genes, may also shape disease risk <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> and influence lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P48">Why OxPhos-induced hypermetabolism is associated with both mtDNA instability and accelerated telomere erosion remains unclear. DNA maintenance (mtDNA, and telomeres) relies on the accuracy of the molecular processes ensuring accurate replication. The energetic tradeoff between translation and growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> could explain why OxPhos-deficient cells, which expend a large fraction of their energy budget to upregulate transcription/translation and secretory, also grow more slowly. Notably, DNA replication is also energetically constrained and sits at the bottom of a hierarchy of energy-consuming processes where vital processes, meaning that in a situation when energy is limited, ionic balance and translation are prioritized over division and DNA replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cells under stress experience an energetic tradeoff between the accuracy of molecular operations and the speed of these processes, known as the energy-speed-accuracy tradeoff <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Hypermetabolism is a global <italic>state</italic> of the cell, and no currently available approach can selectively manipulate or correct hypermetabolism without introducing unresolvable confounds. For this reason, it is currently not possible to mechanistically test this assertion. We speculate that the diversion of energetic resources, as well as substrates including nucleotides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, may contribute to reduced DNA replication fidelity, which in turn could contribute to both mtDNA instability and telomere attrition, independent of cell division.</p><p id="P49">Fourth, our longitudinal RNASeq and DNAm datasets reveal conserved recalibrations implicating developmental and translation-related pathways, as well as cell-cell communication, with OxPhos dysfunction and hypermetabolism. These identified pathways overlap with previously identified multi-omic overrepresentation analysis performed on iPSC-derived neurons from SURF1 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. In both this and our study, neural development, cell signaling, morphogenesis, cell cycle, and metabolism were the predominant processes altered in <italic>SURF1</italic>-related disease. The induction of these energetically-demanding pathways that constrain growth at the cellular and possibly at the organismal level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, could help explain why a major feature of pediatric mitochondrial disorders (including our SURF1 donors) is neurodevelopmental delay, and also why adult patients commonly display short stature (restricted growth) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In relation to cell-cell communication, we note that the biomarker picture of adult patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is dominated, as in our fibroblast models, by <italic>elevated</italic> (not reduced) signaling and metabolic markers in blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Thus, the organism under metabolic stress does not initiate an energy-saving <italic>hypometabolic</italic> state with reduced signaling activity, but instead activates energivorous integrated stress responses that must divert and consume energetic resources, in a tradeoff with other processes such as growth and longevity pathways.</p><p id="P50">Finally, the OxPhos defects in our fibroblasts triggered a shift towards glycolytic ATP production. The glycolytic shift is consistent with the physiological shift in substrate oxidation from lipids/amino acids to carbohydrates, quantified by the respiratory quotient among patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup> and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup> with OxPhos defects. The active shift towards glycolysis occurs even when OxPhos is <italic>not</italic> completely obliterated. For example, although basal respiration was markedly lower in SURF1 cells, the maximal FCCP-uncoupled respiration in SURF1 cells was relatively preserved (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 2C</xref>). This result implies a cellular decision to route metabolic flux towards an energetically less efficient pathway (i.e., glycolysis). This could be explained on the basis of energetic constraints and proteome efficiency, since the proteome cost of OxPhos is at least double that of glycolytic fermentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, cells can “choose” to divert metabolic flux towards glycolysis even when OxPhos is at least partially functional, as in cancer, because of rising intracellular energetic constraints driven by hypermetabolism. We note again that hypermetabolism is apparent across multiple animal models of primary OxPhos dysfunction, manifesting as an elevated cost of living, even during rest and sleep in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In particular, deep phenotyping of <italic>Ant1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice across three studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup> reveals a systemic physiological picture highly consistent with mitochondrial diseases, including excessive mitochondrial biogenesis, elevated circulating catecholamine levels, severe hypermetabolism (+82-85% REE) when adjusted for lower physical activity levels, reduced adiposity, elevated mtDNAcn and mtDNA instability, and decreased median lifespan. These <italic>in vivo</italic> data thus provide additional converging evidence, beyond the clinical data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, that mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction impairs whole-body energetic efficiency and cause physiological hypermetabolism in mammals.</p><p id="P51">Identifying hypermetabolism as a feature of mitochondrial disease has potential clinical utility as it provides an explanatory framework for some of the major symptoms in affected patients. <italic>First</italic>, fatigue and exercise intolerance are evolutionary conserved, subjective experiences that arise when the organism consumes more energy than it would under optimal conditions (e.g., subjective fatigue during the oxygen debt after strenuous exercise, or during an infection). Thus, symptoms of fatigue could be direct consequences of impaired metabolic efficiency and hypermetabolism. <italic>Second</italic>, as noted above, severely affected patients with mitochondrial disease are usually thin, which may be attributable to not only reduced energy intake or to intestinal malabsorption, but to chronic hypermetabolism, effectively burning excess ingested calories, preventing the accumulation of excess adiposity and muscle mass. <italic>Third</italic>, alcohol appears to be poorly tolerated and associated with symptom onset in some patients with mtDNA defects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>, but the basis for alcohol intolerance remains unknown. Alcohol itself causes hypermetabolism in healthy individuals – increasing whole-body REE by as much as 16%, and inhibiting lipid oxidation by 31-36% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>. Alcohol may therefore aggravate pre-existing hypermetabolism, thus imposing further energetic constraints on vital cellular or physiological functions. Finally, chronic hypermetabolism could in part explain why infections can trigger clinical exacerbations, representing the major cause of decompensation and death in this population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The metabolic cost of immune activation to viral and bacterial infection is high, and cytokine production in human leukocytes is under mitochondrial regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>. Thus, immunity must therefore compete with other host maintenance systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>. We speculate that in mitochondrial diseases, because the limited energetic resources are consumed at a higher rate than normal due to systemic hypermetabolism, patients may lack the necessary energetic reserve required to sustain vital organs while mounting adequate immune responses.</p><p id="P52">Together, the meta-analysis of clinical data from 17 cohorts and two cellular models of OxPhos dysfunction identify hypermetabolism as a feature of mitochondrial disease. Our longitudinal patient-derived fibroblasts data delineate some of the cellular and molecular features of OxPhos-induced hypermetabolism, including sustained induction of the ISR, genome instability, hypersecretion of cyto/metabokines, and genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional recalibrations that emphasize the upregulation of processes related to signaling and communication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). A resource webtool with all data from this study, including the RNAseq and DNAm data, is available and can be explored for genes or processes of interest (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S32">Data Availability Statement</xref>). Although further work is needed, these translational data provide a basis to rationalize some unexplained clinical features of mitochondrial diseases. The novel explanatory framework of cellular and physiological hypermetabolism provides a foundation to design well-controlled studies to further understand the extent to which hypermetabolism is a harbinger of morbidity and early mortality in patients with mitochondrial diseases.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P53">A major open question relates to the origin and modifiability of signaling pathway(s) and cellular process(es) that underlie hypermetabolism in OxPhos deficient cells and humans. Rather than pursuing a single potential explanation, here we attempted to deeply phenotype both cellular models of hypermetabolism and to produce a foundational dataset covering several key processes and pathways previously implicated in the pathogenesis of OxPhos defects. Our dataset therefore provides a foundation that can be used as a resource to develop targeted, mechanistic experiments to i) determine the origin and modifiability of hypermetabolism in the context of OxPhos defects in vitro and in vivo, and ii) resolve the mechanism(s) linking hypermetabolism to human aging biology. The small sample size and the <italic>in vitro</italic> nature of the cellular data could be regarded as limitations of this work, potentially limiting generalizability. However, the stability of metabolic and molecular phenotypes in two distinct experimental models, across three unrelated donors (female and male) repeatedly monitored across the replicative lifespan – when cells undergo dynamic age-related changes – is a strong test of robustness for these findings. We also note that the extracellular flux analysis used to derive ATP consumption rates are indirect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, and other approaches such as metabolic tracing experiments would be required to fully understand energy partitioning in hypermetabolic cells. Finally, the clinical phenotyping presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> is not exhaustive, focusing exclusively on available clinical outcomes related to energy expenditure, including indirect calorimetry without careful body composition normalization. Thus, studies are needed to fully define the clinical heterogeneity in energy expenditure among patients, as well as the neuroendocrine and metabolic manifestations of hypermetabolism. Our translational findings highlight more than ever the need for collaborative, multi-center partnerships that bridge the cellular, clinical, and patient-reported aspects of mitochondrial diseases and aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Human cohorts</title><p id="P54">Data were meta-analyzed from 17 mitochondrial disease cohorts listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

When the duplicate T/S value and the initial value varied by more than 7%, the sample was run the third time and the two closest values were reported. 26 out of the 512 samples (5%) has a CV greater than 10% after the third measurement. The inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for this study is 3.0%±4.3% (including the 26 samples) and 2.2%±2.0% (excluding the 26 samples). Telomere length assay for the entire study were performed using the same lots of reagents. Lab personnel lab who performed the assays were provided with de-identified samples and were blind to other data.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>DNAmAge</title><p id="P84">DNAmAge was calculated using the online calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/new"><underline>https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/new</underline></ext-link>) with normalization using the age of cell line donor as the input age. This outputted the Horvath1 (i.e. PanTissue clock), Horvath2 (Skin&amp;Blood clock), PhenoAge, Hannum, and GrimAge estimated DNAmAges. PC-based DNAmAges were then obtained using the principal component method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MorganLevineLab/PC-Clocks">https://github.com/MorganLevineLab/PC-Clocks</ext-link>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. The rates of epigenetic aging for each cell line were determined from the linear slope of timepoints between 25 to 75 days. This period ensures that Oligo treatment has taken effect, and avoids late-life changes in the behavior of DNAm clocks, providing the time window where the signal is most stable.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p id="P85">All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v9.0) and RStudio (v1.3.1056) using R (v4.0.2). Comparisons of groups between control, SURF1 and treatment groups were performed using mixed effects model, except for peak and rate measurements (unpaired T-test, assuming unequal variance or two-way ANOVA for concurrent measures). Interpolated curves for each experimental group is the best fit non-linear third order or fifth order polynomial functions depending on the kinetic complexity a given measurement. Data visualization and statistical analyses were generated in R (‘ggplot2’, v3.3.5) and Prism 8.</p><p id="P86">The time windows for specific statistical analyses were selected based on a combination of cellular growth behavior including: i) population doubling curves (e.g., stable division rates for all groups early in the cellular lifespan between days 20-50), ii) the availability of matching timepoints between treatment groups (at least 3 timepoints for all groups), and iii) potential delay to reach stable cellular phenotypes in Oligo-treated cells. To allow for adjustment to the <italic>in vitro</italic> environment, treatments began after 15 days of culture. Therefore, overall “lifespan effects” were determined between 20-150 days, which represents the maximal replicative lifespan of SURF1 cells. “Early life” effects that isolate most clearly the effects of OxPhos dysfunction, and avoid the potential accelerated aging phenotypes in SURF1 and Oligo cells, were examined using timepoints between 20-50 days. For analyses of differentially expressed genes (RNASeq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) and differential methylation (DNAm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) where a greater datapoint density was necessary to achieve robust mixed effects models, SURF1 cells were analyzed between 0 and 75 days (genetic defects in <italic>SURF1</italic> are constitutive so do not require time in culture to manifest) whereas models for Oligo-treated cells used timepoints between days 35 to 110 (allowing 15 days for the effects of ATP synthase inhibition to manifest in the transcriptome, while avoiding late-life changes).
