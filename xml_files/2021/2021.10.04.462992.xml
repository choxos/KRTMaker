Yet, this approach is challenged by continuously emerging variants and by time limitations of vaccine preparation techniques. This work describes the design and evaluation of an anti-IBV vaccine comprised of <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing and secreting viral spike 1 subunit (S1) and nucleocapsid N-terminus and C-terminus polypeptides fused to heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) (LS1, LNN, LNC, respectively). Following chicken oral vaccination, anti-IBV IgY levels and cellular-mediated immunity as well as protection against virulent IBV challenge, were evaluated 14 days following the booster dose. Oral vaccination induced IgY levels that exceeded those measured following vaccination with each component separately. Following exposure to inactivated IBV, splenocytes isolated from chicks orally vaccinated with LNN or LNC -expressing bacteria, showed a higher percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to splenocytes isolated from chicks vaccinated with wild type or LTB-secreting <italic>E. coli</italic> and to chicks subcutaneously vaccinated. Significant reduction in viral load and percent of shedders in the vaccinated chicks was evident starting 3 days following challenge with 10<sup>7.5</sup> EID<sub>50</sub>/ml virulent IBV. Taken together, orally delivered LTB-fused IBV polypeptide-expressing bacteria induced virus-specific IgY antibody production and was associated with significantly shorter viral shedding on challenge with a live IBV. The proposed vaccine design and delivery route promise an effective and rapidly adaptable means of protecting poultry farms from devastating IB outbreaks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Infectious bronchitis virus</kwd><kwd>Avian corona virus</kwd><kwd>Oral vaccination</kwd><kwd>Heat labile enterotoxin</kwd><kwd>Subunit vaccine</kwd><kwd>Fusion polypeptides</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, primarily affecting chickens, worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Other non-respiratory clinical manifestations of IB are nephritis, and reduced egg production and quality. IB virus (IBV), the etiological viral agent of the disease, is an enveloped <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, of the genus <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, which is grouped into six, genetically divergent genotypes (GI-GVI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], that all contain a non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, ~27,600-nucleotide RNA genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P3">The IBV genome encodes 15 non-structural proteins involved in replication (ORF1ab), four accessory proteins and four structural proteins (spike glycoprotein [S], matrix [M], nucleocapsid [N], and envelope protein [E]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The S protein is comprised of two subunits, with S1 mediating viral attachment to host cells and bearing a receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 driving membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Antigenic and genetic variants of IBV have been classified based on S1 gene nucleotide sequence analysis.</p><p id="P4">IBV infects the host by inhalation or ingestion and initially replicates in the upper respiratory tract and trachea, the primary target organ, after which, it disseminates to enteric tissues, particularly the proventriculus, intestine and cecal tonsils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], as well as to the kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Infection of the lymphoid tissue-containing cecal tonsils in the intestine commonly results in a persistent infection lasting weeks or months after the acute disease episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. IBV can rapidly spread, and cause high rates of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The most efficient means of coping with IBV is via vaccination with either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. The recommendation by veterinary authorities in Israel for broilers is to administer an attenuated vaccine at 1-day of age by spray, drinking water or eye drop, followed by a boost at 10-12 days of age. In layers and breeders, vaccination programs include live vaccines at young ages, followed by injection of inactivated vaccines. However, available vaccines are challenged by the emergence of new IBV serotypes, for which the vaccine strain provides little or no cross-protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Development of new live attenuated vaccines is performed by serial passage of field virus isolates in embryonated eggs, which is a laborious and time-consuming process with an unpredictable outcome concerning vaccine safety and degree of attenuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In the era of molecular biology, protein subunits for vaccination may be delivered as polypeptides, by viral or bacterial delivery systems that carry and express relevant genes encoding desired antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. For example, oral administration of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> expressing MSA2, a protein projected to protect against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection, resulted in high IgG levels in vaccinated rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Adjuvants are often used to enhance immune responses to vaccination. One such mucosal adjuvant is heat labile enterotoxin B (LTB), which is a non-toxic homo-pentamer subunit of LT toxin expressed by enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (ETEC), responsible for binding to the host GM1 ganglioside receptors. LTB has been used in several vaccine development studies both as a free adjuvant and in fusion with various antigens. Subcutaneous immunization of mice with <italic>H. pylori</italic> urease antigen mixed with LTB, increased levels of specific IgG in serum and IgA in saliva and conferred high protection against the pathogen as compared to none-adjuvanted immunization and the untreated control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Similarly, addition of LTB to egg drop syndrome adenovirus rKnob significantly elevated the antibody response of orally and transcutaneously vaccinated chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with a chimeric protein of LTB and two epitopes from the Zaire ebolavirus GP1 protein, induced both IgA and IgG antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The present work aimed to develop a trivalent anti-IBV vaccine comprised of LTB-fused viral S1 and two subunits of N proteins expressed and delivered by a live bacterial system. The humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, as well as, the protection efficacy of the oral vaccination following challenge were assessed in chickens.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | method"><title>Materials and Method</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cloning and expression of LTB-fused N and S1 IBV polypeptides</title><sec id="S4"><title>Generating structural models of LTB and viral antigens</title><p id="P8">The design of the fusion polypeptides with proper folding and correct epitope presentation was supported by a three-dimensional computer model for each of the fusion constructs.

Each template of a fusion protein component was manually oriented to allow pentameric complex formation for the LTB segment and presentation of the N and S1 epitopes. Thereafter, the Modeller program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] was used to generate homology models of the fused protein, allowing for loop optimization in areas without an appropriate template structure.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Plasmid construction and transformation</title><p id="P9">DNA fragments coding for LTB and specific IBV domains, were ordered from GenScript. The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the codon-optimized sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Briefly, each sequence was amplified in two steps, using primers F1 and F2 for all samples and R, Ra, Rb and Rc for LTB, LTB-NN (LNN), LTB-NC (LNC) and LTB-S1 (LS1), respectively. The resulting cassettes were cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy Vector (Promega), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A schematic model of the constructs is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The plasmid constructs were transformed into electrocompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 cells, using established procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989).

Partial purification was performed by ultrafiltration to increase the protein concentration. Briefly, 1L of the collected bacterial medium was passed through a 0.2 Î¼m microbiological membrane and then concentrated x 100 using 10 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore).

Orally administered LTB-NN was associated with splenocyte immune responses following exposure to an inactivated IBV that exceeded the responsiveness of splenocytes isolated from chickens subcutaneously vaccinated with the same polypeptide. In addition, significantly less viral shedding was measured in chickens orally immunized with the LTB-fused IBV peptide mix or with LS1 as compared to all other test groups, including those receiving the commercial inactivated vaccine. In the group vaccinated by the LTB-fused IBV peptide mix, a significantly shorter shedding period was shown as compared to all other groups, including the group vaccinated with LS1 alone.</p><p id="P30">Mucosal vaccination confers benefits over other routes of administration, including strong mucosal immunity, which provides the first barrier against pathogens entering via the mucosa. Live attenuated viruses are widely used for mucosal vaccination, including Newcastle disease virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], IBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and avian reovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Yet, the attenuation process is long and costly and some safety concerns are raised, such as the possibility of virus reversion to a virulent state in immunocompromised hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Protein-based vaccines are intrinsically safer than whole pathogen-based vaccines and are faster to adjust. Yet, despite extensive efforts toward development of protein-based mucosal vaccines against various infectious diseases, there are currently no approved oral or intranasal protein vaccines. Integration of LTB in protein vaccines has been shown to enhance immune responses. In addition, live bacterial cells as delivery vehicles for recombinant antigen have been suggested to serve as effective adjuvants due to their potent activation of the innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. For example, a recombinant subunit vaccine containing the R repeat region of P97 adhesin of <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> fused to LTB and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, produced high levels of systemic and mucosal antibodies in intranasally or intramuscularly inoculated BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Similarly, LTB-fused recombinant C-terminal fragments of botulinum neurotoxins serotypes C and D, produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The same recombinant vaccine induced a strong immunogenic response in cattle as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Nandre et al. report on a significant reduction in egg and internal organ contamination by virulent <italic>Salmonella</italic> enteritidis (SE) in laying hens orally inoculated with live attenuated LTB-secreting <italic>Salmonella</italic> enteritidis (SE-LTB) as compared to those receiving a commercial anti-SE inactivated vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In line with these studies, the current work demonstrated the safety and potency of <italic>E. coli</italic> as a vaccine delivery platform, as well as the additive effect of LTB integration in vaccine design.</p><p id="P31">The presented vaccine was designed to simultaneously target several epitopes, with the goal of increasing humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity and providing for more robust control and prevention of IBV disease. The research focused on the S and N proteins, in light of evidence of the role of both S1 and N genes in the induction of immune responses against IBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Specifically, Meir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] reported on both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following vaccination of chickens with an anti-IBV eye drop vaccine comprised of recombinant S1 or N expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The selected peptides correspond to regions of both the S1 and N viral proteins that provide maximal coverage of protective epitopes. Integration of the highly conserved N protein may contribute to group-common immunity against IBV variant viruses. These features were ensured by a thorough structural analysis of available high-resolution structures of the S1 and N homologue proteins in search of independent folding units, while avoiding destabilization of the native structure. Fusion of these antigen sequences to LTB via a linker segment allowed both native LTB pentameric complex formation and the native fold of each of the antigens S1 and N. The construct design was aided by use of 3D computer modelling available for IBV proteins S and N. For the S1 protein sequence analysis, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of infectious bronchitis coronavirus spike protein was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. This structure is 96.5 identical to the S1 sequence from strain H120 and therefore served as the template for homology model of the S1 protein. The N protein had fragmented structures from similar sequences in the protein data bank spanning residues 22-160 and 218-333 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. The N-terminal part (residues 22-160) of the high-resolution structures of the nucleoprotein is 90.3% identical to the correlated segment from H120 strain used in this study and the C-terminal segment (residues 218-333) of the high-resolution structures of the nucleoprotein is 93.6% identical to the correlated segment from H120 strain used in this study.</p><p id="P32">Poultry rearing, one of the largest livestock enterprises, is highly vulnerable to viral outbreaks, which can have devastating implications on local and national economies, as well as on food security. Thus, breeders are continuously seeking potent and cost-effective vaccination strategies to control disease. Oral inoculation is a user-friendly mass-vaccination strategy. Given that IBV is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets, effective mucosal immunity might improve protection against nasal and/or oral virus entry. Moreover, mucosal immunity decreases viral shedding, as described in the current study. In addition, this route promises to overcome significant constraints related to vaccine administration, including the avoidance of stress due to chicken herding and injection. The rationale behind the presented vaccine design may be the basis for further development of affordable, rapidly adaptable mucosal non-live vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack
