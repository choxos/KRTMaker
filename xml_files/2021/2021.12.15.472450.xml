            <p id="P1">The furin cleavage site (FCS), an unusual feature in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, has been spotlighted as a factor key to facilitating infection and pathogenesis by increasing spike processing <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
               </sup>. Similarly, the QTQTN motif directly upstream of the FCS is also an unusual feature for group 2B coronaviruses (CoVs). The QTQTN deletion has consistently been observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured virus stocks and some clinical isolates <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
               </sup>. To determine whether the QTQTN motif is critical to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, we generated a mutant deleting the QTQTN motif (ΔQTQTN). Here we report that the QTQTN deletion attenuates viral replication in respiratory cells in vitro and attenuates disease <italic>in vivo</italic>. The deletion results in a shortened, more rigid peptide loop that contains the FCS, and is less accessible to host proteases, such as TMPRSS2. Thus, the deletion reduced the efficiency of spike processing and attenuates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the QTQTN motif also contains residues that are glycosylated<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
               </sup>, and disruption its glycosylation also attenuates virus replication in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Together, our results reveal that three aspects of the S1/S2 cleavage site – the FCS, loop length, and glycosylation – are required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and has caused the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza outbreak <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
            </sup>. An unusual feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of a furin cleavage site in its spike protein <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
            </sup>. The CoV spike, a trimer of spike proteins composed of the S1 and S2 subunits, responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
            </sup>. After receptor binding, the spike protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S1 and S2 sites to activate the fusion machinery. For SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein contains a novel cleavage motif recognized by the host cell furin protease (PRRAR) directly upstream of the S1 cleavage site that facilitates cleavage prior to virion release from the producer cell. This furin cleavage site (FCS), not found in other group 2B CoVs, plays a key role in spike processing, infectivity, and pathogenesis as shown by our group and others <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
            </sup>.</p>
         <p id="P3">Importantly, another novel amino acid motif, QTQTN, is found directly upstream of the FCS. This QTQTN motif, also absent in other group 2B CoVs, is often deleted and has been pervasive in cultured virus stocks of the alpha, beta, and delta variants <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
            </sup>. In addition, the QTQTN deletion has been observed in a small subset of patient samples as well <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
            </sup>. Because this deletion has been frequently identified, we set out to characterize it and determine whether it has consequences for viral replication and virulence. Using our infectious clone <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
            </sup>, we demonstrated that the loss of this motif attenuates SARS-CoV-2 replication in respiratory cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and pathogenesis in hamsters. The QTQTN deletion results in reduced spike cleavage and diminished capacity to use serine proteases on the cell surface for entry. Importantly, mutations of glycosylation-enabling residues in the QTQTN motif results in similar replication attenuation despite intact spike processing. Together, our results highlight elements in the SARS-CoV-2 spike in addition to the furin cleavage site that contribute to increased replication and pathogenesis.</p>

            <title>ΔQTQTN attenuates viral replication</title>
            <p id="P4">In addition to the furin cleavage site (FCS), comparison of group 2B coronavirus sequences also revealed the presence of an upstream QTQTN motif directly in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; this motif is absent in other coronaviruses except for the closely related RaTG13 bat coronavirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, this QTQTN motif is often deleted in SARS-CoV-2 strains propagated in Vero E6 cells <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
               </sup>. To explore the role of the QTQTN motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis, we generated a mutant in the WA-1 background (early U.S. case from 2020) by deleting QTQTN (ΔQTQTN) using our reverse genetics system <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
               </sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Examining the deletion on the SARS-CoV-2 spike structure, our modeling suggested that the ΔQTQTN mutant forms a stable α-helix in the loop containing the S1’ cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). While the mutant retains the furin cleavage motif, its a-helix is predicted to make the loop less flexible and reduce access to the proteolytic cleavage site.</p>
            <p id="P5">The deletion of QTQTN motif did not affect virus replication in Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney cells) cells with the rescue stock titer comparable to wild-type WA-1 (WT) in yield; yet, the ΔQTQTN mutant produced a large plaque morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-b</xref>), as seen with a FCS knockout mutant (ΔPRRA) <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
               </sup>. We then evaluated replication kinetics of ΔQTQTN in Vero E6 cells and found no difference between WT and ΔQTQTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). However, following direct 1:1 competition infections, the ΔQTQTN mutant had a significant advantage relative to WT SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). This fitness advantage for ΔQTQTN likely explains the accumulation of this mutation in Vero E6-amplified virus stocks, as we also observed when this mutation emerges in Vero E6 cells infected with WT alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c-d</xref>). Notably, in Calu-3 2B4 cells, a human respiratory cell line, we observed a ~2.5 log reduction in ΔQTQTN replication at both 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Together, the results indicate that ΔQTQTN mutant is attenuated in respiratory cells and has a fitness advantage in Vero E6 cells; these results are similar findings to those we reported for the SARS-CoV-2 FCS knockout virus <sup>

            </title>
            <p id="P6">We next evaluated the role of ΔQTQTN on virulence in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Three- to four-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters, which develop disease similar to that seen in humans <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
               </sup>, were intranasally inoculated with 10<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
               </sup> plaque-forming units (pfu) of WT SARS-CoV-2 or ΔQTQTN mutant and monitored for 7 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Hamsters infected with WT steadily lost weight from 2 dpi with average peak weight loss of ~10% before beginning to recover at 5 dpi and regaining their starting weight by 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The disease score peaks corresponded with maximum weight loss, with hamsters exhibiting ruffled fur, hunched posture, and/or reduced activity requiring additional welfare checks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Of note, 50% of WT-infected hamsters reached euthanasia criteria by 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, hamsters infected with ΔQTQTN experienced minimal weight loss and gained weight over the course of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Similarly, no obvious disease was observed in ΔQTQTN infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Hamsters infected with ΔQTQTN developed pulmonary lesions that were less extensive than those in hamsters infected with WT SARS CoV-2, involving smaller portions of the infected lungs on both days 2 and 4 after intranasal inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).

Characteristic cytopathologic effects were observed in alveolar pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelium, including cellular enlargement, binucleation and multinucleation, and prominent nucleoli.

            <p id="P7">Despite clear attenuation in disease, ΔQTQTN viral replication in vivo was not compromised compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. In fact, viral titers were greater than WT SARS-CoV-2 with a 10-fold increase in nasal wash titers at 1, 2, and 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Similar titer increases were observed in the trachea of infected hamsters at 2 dpi with equivalent titers at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Notably, viral titers were equivalent in the lungs for both 2 and 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Examining viral RNA, we found that ΔQTQTN also had equivalent levels of viral replication relative to control SARS-CoV-2 in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>.). RNA expression data from hamster lung samples revealed clustering of WT and ΔQTQTN at 2 dpi and 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Of note, although more variability was present at 2 dpi, ΔQTQTN was slightly closer to mock samples at both time points. However, upregulated genes were similar between WT and ΔQTQTN in comparison to mock at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c-d</xref>). Together, these results indicate that attenuation of ΔQTQTN <italic>in vivo</italic> is not due to change in replication capacity.

            <p id="P8">To examine the role of the QTQTN motif in spike processing, Vero E6 and Calu3-2B4 cells were infected with WT or ΔQTQTN and supernatant harvested at 24 hpi. Virus was then purified through sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation. Western blotting of the purified virus revealed reduced spike processing at the S1/S2 cleavage site for ΔQTQTN compared to WT in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Loss of the QTQTN motif resulted in little S1/S2 cleavage product and a significant increase in full-length spike compared to WT control. A similar reduction in spike processing was seen in Calu3-2B4 cells, although with more processing overall compared to in Vero E6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, deletion of the QTQTN motif impairs spike cleavage at the S1/S2 site, similar to findings with the SARS-CoV-2 mutants lacking the FCS <sup>

            <p id="P9">After receptor binding, the CoV spike protein is cleaved by a host protease as part of the virus entry process. Different proteases can be utilized to activate the spike fusion machinery: serine proteases like TMPRSS2 at the cell surface or cathepsins within endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Our prior work found that the absence of TMPRSS2 in Vero E6 cells plays a role in selection of SARS-CoV-2 strains with FCS deletions <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
               </sup>. Calu-3 2B4 cells also express high levels of TMPRSS2. We therefore hypothesized that the absence of TMPRSS2 activity contributes to ΔQTQTN selection in Vero E6 and attenuation in Calu3 2B-4 cells. To test this hypothesis, Vero E6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 were pretreated with cathepsin inhibitor K11777 before infection with WT or ΔQTQTN, and viral titers were measured at 24 hpi. With cathepsin inhibited and TMPRSS2 activity intact, a significant, ~1.5 log reduction in viral titer was observed for ΔQTQTN compared to WT over a dose range of K11777, mirroring the attenuation observed in the Calu-3 2B4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Infection of untreated TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 revealed no difference in replication between WT and ΔQTQTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). When Calu-3 2B4 cells were pretreated with the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, WT SARS-CoV-2 titers were reduced and equivalent to ΔQTQTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the loss of the QTQTN motif reduces the capacity of the virus to use TMPRSS2 for entry.</p>

            <title>Glycosylation of the QTQTN motif contributes to spike processing</title>
            <p id="P10">As the absence of the QTQTN motif attenuates SARS-CoV-2, we set out to determine if the QTQTN motif itself has a significant role during infection. Notably, the second threonine, T678, of the motif has been previously shown to be O-linked glycosylated <sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
               </sup>. Structurally, the QTQTN site resides on an exterior loop of the spike and is capable of accommodating large glycans, which may contribute to interactions with proteases like TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To determine the role of glycosylation in spike processing, we generated mutants abolishing the glycosylated T678 (QTQVN) alone or together with the first threonine T676 (QVQVN) to exclude possible compensatory glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similar to ΔQTQTN, the glycosylation mutations did not affect virus yield with titers comparable to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). However, plaque morphologies of QTQVN and QVQVN were more similar to WT than to the ΔQTQTN mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Viral replication in Vero E6 cells was not affected for QTQVN and QVQVN mutants; however, both were attenuated at 24 hpi in Calu-3 2B4 cells, mirroring what was observed with the ΔQTQTN mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-d</xref>). Moreover, viral titers of the glycosylation mutants reached WT levels by 48 hpi in Calu-3 2B4. Together, these results indicate that the loss of glycosylation sites in the QTQTN motif attenuates replication in Calu-3 2B4 cells.</p>
            <p id="P11">We next examined if the glycosylation-defective mutants had altered spike processing similar to ΔQTQTN. Western blotting of virus purified from Calu-3 2B4 cells by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation revealed intact spike processing at the S1/S2 site with both glycosylation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Contrasting with ΔQTQTN, the QTQVN and QVQVN mutants had significant S1/S2 spike cleavage with levels similar to WT SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, spike processing of QTQVN and QVQVN in normal and TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells was similar to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4d-e</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the loss of glycosylated residues does not impact spike processing of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
            <p id="P12">To further understand the role of glycosylation in spike processing, we next examined if glycosylation is involved in protease interaction and usage. Using TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6, we pretreated cells with K11777 to disrupt cathepsin activity, infected with WT, ΔQTQTN, QTQVN, or QVQVN, and examined viral titers at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). While the ΔQTQTN titer was reduced compared to WT as observed before, the QTQVN titer was equivalent to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In contrast, disruption of both glycosylation residues with the QVQVN mutant titer resulted in attenuation equivalent to that of ΔQTQTN, suggesting that abolishing both O-linked glycosylation sites disrupted TMPRSS2 utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). We subsequently pretreated Calu-3 2B4 cells with camostat mesylate to disrupt serine protease activity and infected with the glycosylation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Interestingly, while treatment with camostat in Calu-3 2B4 cells reduced WT titer to equivalent levels as ΔQTQTN, viral titers of QTQVN and QVQVN mutants were even lower. However, the overall differences in titer between WT and the glycosylation mutants was reduced, suggesting that glycosylation is important for TMPRSS2 utilization and entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Overall, these results argue that glycosylation of the QTQTN motif is important to protease interactions with spike and SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

               </sup>. Yet, the FCS alone is insufficient to drive infection and pathogenesis. The upstream QTQTN motif adds two distinct elements that contribute to this capacity and virulence. The loss of the QTQTN motif produces a shorter, more rigid exterior loop in the spike, likely reducing access to the FCS. The result is a significant reduction in spike processing and attenuation of the ΔQTQTN mutant both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, while mutations of the glycosylation residues in the QTQTN motif do not change overall spike processing, the modification of the motif attenuates virus replication in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Overall, our results argue that the FCS, the length/composition of the exterior loop, and glycosylation of the QTQTN motif are all needed for efficient infection and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Disruption of any of these three elements attenuates SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the complexity of spike activation beyond the simple presence of a furin cleavage site.</p>
