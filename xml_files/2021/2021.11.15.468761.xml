<abstract>
<p id="P2">Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, infection with SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen responsible for COVID-19, is often associated with neurologic symptoms that range from mild to severe, yet increasing evidence argues the virus does not exhibit extensive neuroinvasive properties. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human iPSC-derived neurons and that infection shows limited anti-viral and inflammatory responses but increased activation of EIF2 signaling following infection as determined by RNA sequencing. Intranasal infection of K18 human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in lung pathology associated with viral replication and immune cell infiltration. In addition, ~50% of infected mice exhibited CNS infection characterized by wide-spread viral replication in neurons accompanied by increased expression of chemokine (<italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Ccl19</italic>) and cytokine (<italic>Ifn-λ</italic> and <italic>Tnf-α</italic>) transcripts associated with microgliosis and a neuroinflammatory response consisting primarily of monocytes/macrophages. Microglia depletion via administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, PLX5622, in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice did not affect survival or viral replication but did result in dampened expression of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine transcripts and a reduction in monocyte/macrophage infiltration. These results argue that microglia are dispensable in terms of controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication in in the K18-hACE2 model but do contribute to an inflammatory response through expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, these findings contribute to previous work demonstrating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons as well as emphasizing the potential use of the K18-hACE2 model to study immunological and neuropathological aspects related to SARS-CoV-2-induced neurologic disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is complex, and numerous risk factors and comorbidities are considered important in affecting disease severity including age, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. In addition, neurological symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the virus can potentially infect and replicate in the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, encephalitis and meningitis have been reported in COVID-19 patients, and viral RNA and protein have been detected within the CSF of infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Additionally, human brain organoids are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], yet demonstration of extensive CNS penetrance by SARS-CoV-2 has remained elusive. It is imperative to develop pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 that capture consistent and reproducible clinical and histologic readouts of many disease-associated symptoms following experimental infection with clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Importantly, these models should be able to reliably evaluate interventional therapies to limit viral replication and mute immune-mediated pathology, as well as evaluate effectiveness of novel vaccines, all while remaining cost-effective. To date, the most common animal models employed to evaluate COVID-19 pathogenesis include mice, non-human primates (rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys), Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="P4">Human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse models have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Perlman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] developed the K18-hACE2 mice, initially used as a mouse model of SARS-CoV-1, which has been successfully employed as a model of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in a dose-dependent increase in weight loss and mortality with the lung being the major site of viral infection, while lower amounts of virus are detected in the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Examination of lungs revealed distribution of viral antigen associated with alveolar damage, interstitial lesions, edema, and inflammation. Lung infection resulted in an increase in expression of interferons as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with neutrophil, macrophage/monocyte, and T cell infiltration. Viral RNA was also detected within the sinonasal epithelium, and viral antigen was present in sustentacular cells associated with anosmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Examination of brains of SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2 transgenic mice has indicated that infection of the CNS is not consistent, and in some cases, virus is rarely detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. This may reflect the SARS-CoV-2 isolate being studied as well as the dose of virus being administered. However, in those animals in which virus penetrates the brain, there can be extensive spread of the virus throughout different anatomic regions accompanied by cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], and these results are consistent with early studies examining SARS-CoV-1 infection of K18-hACE2 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. High-level of CNS infection in K18-hACE2 is accompanied by meningeal inflammation associated with immune cell infiltration into the brain parenchyma and microglia activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Enhanced CNS penetrance and replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the CNS of K18-hACE2 is associated with increased mortality; although the mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear. The present study was undertaken to i) expand on earlier studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infection of human CNS resident cells, ii) evaluate the immune response that occurs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS of K18-hACE2 mice and iii) assess the contributions of microglia in host defense following CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of human neurons</title>
<p id="P5">Previous studies have indicated neurons are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (2); therefore, we infected human iPSC-derived neurons with SARS-CoV-2. Similar to earlier reports, SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect and replicate within neurons as determined by staining for nucleocapsid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and B</xref>). By 48h p.i., viral nucleocapsid protein had spread from the neuron cell body and extended down dendritic and axonal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C and D</xref>). Notably, we did not detect syncytia formation in neuron cultures at any time following infection with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that virus may not spread via fusion with neighboring cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that expression of both anti-viral and inflammatory responses in infected neurons was limited relative to the genes within the heatmap at both 24h and 48h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then evaluated pathways that may progressively change between 24h and 48h post-infection comparing the Transcripts per million (TPMs) as input for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> shows the top 12 IPA canonical pathways that are overrepresented. eIF2 signaling is the predominant pathway induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection of neurons, followed by pathways associated with oxidative phosphorylation, eIF4, MTOR signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction, the latter with no prediction of activity. Notably, the Coronavirus Pathogenesis Pathway is also overrepresented, however is inhibited in response to neuronal infection by SARS-CoV-2 over the time frame tested with the majority of the genes represented encoding ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungs of K18-hACE2 mice</title>
<p id="P6">K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with either 1x10<sup>4</sup>, 5x10<sup>4</sup> or 1x10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2, and weight loss and mortality were recorded. Consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], we observed a general trend towards dose-dependent increase in weight loss and mortality out to day 7 post-infection (p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). qPCR indicated the presence of viral RNA in lungs of infected K18-hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization of lungs of mice infected with 5x10<sup>4</sup> PFU of virus at day 7 p.i. revealed localized areas of viral infection as determined by expression of spike RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lungs demonstrated both alveolar and interstitial lesions, with alveolar hemorrhage and edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref>), interstitial congestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and lymphocytic infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). qPCR analysis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicated increased expression of <italic>Ifn-λ</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Cxcr2</italic>, and <italic>Ccl2</italic> yet varied expression of <italic>Il-10</italic>, <italic>TNF-<bold>α</bold>, Ccl19, and Ccl5</italic> and limited expression of transcripts for <italic>Ifn-β1</italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed immune cell infiltrates in SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs containing inflammatory CD8+ T cells as determined by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A-D</xref>). In addition, germinal center-like structures were detected within the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with enriched CD8+ T cell accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E and F</xref>). Collectively, our findings are consistent with previous studies employing SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice in terms of development of interstitial pneumonia and immune cell infiltration associated with viral RNA present within the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p>

<title>Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P7">Following intranasal infection of mice with 5x10<sup>4</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2, virus was detected in the brain as determined by qPCR and RNAscope compared to sham-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-C</xref>). Using a Spike-specific probe, we observed wide-spread expansion of viral mRNA throughout the brain with many distinct anatomical regions infected as well as spared. By day 7 p.i., viral RNA was present within the cortex (CTX), striatum (STR), pallidum (PAL), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus (HY), midbrain (MB), pons (P), and medulla (MD), whereas areas that were relatively spared included the olfactory bulb (OB), white matter (WM) tracts, hippocampus (HC) and cerebellum (CB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>); no viral RNA was detected in sham-infected K18-hACE2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Demyelinating lesions have been detected in post-mortem brains of COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], however we did not detect any evidence of demyelination within the brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice as determined by luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D and E</xref>). The predominant cellular target for SARS-CoV-2 infection was neurons as determined by cellular morphology of cells positive for viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A and B</xref>). In a small percentage of infected mice, we were able to detect viral RNA in the olfactory bulb with primary targets being mitral and glomerular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Prominent neuropathological changes detected included perivascular cuffing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), subventricular inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F</xref>) and leptomeningitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), consistent with previous studies (2, 3).</p>
<p id="P8">Analysis of CNS myeloid cells showed increased IBA1 soma size and shortened/thickened processes, indicative of microglial activation in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice compared to sham-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescent co-staining for Mac2/galectin-3+ cells, a marker recently identified in peripheral cell infiltrates, and IBA1 (Hohsfield <italic>et al. manuscript in revision),</italic> revealed increased monocyte/macrophage infiltration within the brains of infected mice compared to sham-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Mac2+ cells enter the CNS parenchyma from different anatomic areas including the ventricles, leptomeninges and vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) when compared to uninfected control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>

<title>Microglia ablation does not affect disease or control of viral replication in the CNS</title>
<p id="P9">Previous studies have implicated the importance of microglia in aiding in control of neuroadapted murine beta-coronaviruses by enhancing anti-viral T cell responses through augmenting antigen presentation (11-13). Notably, microglia are dependent on signaling through the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for their survival and can be effectively eliminated with CSF1R inhibitors that cross the blood brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. K18-hACE2 mice were fed pre-formulated chow containing either the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (1,200 ppm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] or control chow 7 days prior to intranasal infection with 5x10<sup>4</sup> PFUs of SARS-CoV-2, and remained on drug for the duration of the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. No notable differences were detected in weight loss between experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). SARS-CoV-2-infected mice treated with either PLX5622 or control chow were sacrificed at day 7 p.i., and viral mRNA levels in lungs and brains were determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, we detected no significant differences in the Spike mRNA transcripts in either the lung or the brain between experimental groups. Quantification of Iba1-positive cells revealed a &gt;95% reduction (p&lt;0.01) in microglia in PLX5622-treated mice compared to control mice. Overall, PLX5622-mediated ablation of microglia resulted in a dramatic reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine genes within the brains of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice when compared to infected mice fed control chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). By day 7 p.i., SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mice treated with control chow. The highest transcript levels were for the T cell chemoattractants CXCL9 and CXCL10; monocyte/macrophage chemoattractants, CCL2 and CCL5; and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Transcripts encoding the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, and B cell chemoattractant CCL19 were also increased, as well as IFN-λ type 3 and IL-10 when compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Depletion of microglia resulted in a marked reduced expression of the majority chemokine/cytokines transcripts. While not significant, there was a marked reduction in Mac2/galactin3+ cells in PLX5622-treated mice when compared to control chow and this correlated with reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>) that have previously been shown to attract these cells into the CNS of mice infected with a neurotropic mouse coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P11">In the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to develop pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 that capture consistent and reproducible clinical and histologic readouts of many disease-associated symptoms following experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. For both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the surface-bound viral spike glycoprotein uses the cellular surface receptor protein, ACE2, to bind and enter cells. However, mouse ACE2 does not efficiently bind the spike glycoprotein of either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, rendering wildtype mice not useful in the study of SARS or COVID-19 pathogenesis, respectively, due to an inefficient ability to infect and replicate in host cells. Human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse models have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in terms of evaluating the efficacy and duration of immune responses elicited in response to infection as well as testing vaccines, anti-viral drugs and monoclonal antibody therapies to restrict viral replication and limit disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p>
<p id="P12">Intranasal inoculation of K18-hACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in weight loss along with viral infection and replication within the lungs that was associated with a robust inflammatory response. These findings are consistent with other reports that demonstrated the presence of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and T cells within the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In response to infection, expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines was increased and correlated with the presence of inflammatory cells. We detected inflammatory CD8+ T cells in the lungs of infected mice and these cells are presumably responding to the T cell chemoattractant CXCL10. Our lab has previously shown that induction of CXCL10 expression following experimental infection of mice with a neuroadapted strain of murine coronavirus is critical in host defense and acts by attracting virus-specific T cells into the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Similarly, inflammatory monocyte/macrophages are likely recruited in response to expression of CCL2 as this has been shown to attract these cells following murine coronavirus infection of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The increased expression of transcripts encoding CXCR2 most likely reflects the presence of inflammatory neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Therapeutic targeting of these chemokines may therefore alter immune cell trafficking into the lungs of infected mice and alleviate the severity of lung pathology. How blocking chemokine signaling would affect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology in COVID-19 patients is currently under investigation.</p>
<p id="P13">Clinical reports of COVID-19 patients cite a dysregulated immune response characterized by elevated chemokine expression as key in the development of pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Similar to our findings using the K18-hACE2 model, these reports have found upregulation of CCL2 (MCP1), CXCL8 (IL-8), and CXCL10 (IP10) to correlate with severity of disease and have suggested evaluation of these as biomarkers for disease and as targets for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Leronlimab, a CCR5-blocking antibody, is currently in phase 2 clinical trials in the U.S. for treatment of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 (NCT04343651, NCT04347239). In addition, limiting neutrophil infiltration into the lungs of COVID-19 patients may help prevent disease progression and outcome. With this in mind, the monoclonal antibody BMS-986253 that blocks CXCL8 as well as Reparixin, an oral inhibitor of CXCR1/2, are both currently undergoing clinical trials in the U.S. for reducing the severity of COVID-19-related pneumonia by reducing neutrophil accumulation within the lungs of infected patients (NCT04878055, NCT04347226). A clinical trial was recently completed using measurement of CXCL10 in a Clinical Decision Support Protocol in COVID-19 patients (NCT04389645) that positively correlated CXCL10 levels with mortality suggesting that targeting CXCL10 signaling may also be beneficial in managing disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p>
<p id="P14">Examination of brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, as well as brains from other hACE2 transgenic mice, has revealed that virus is able to infect, replicate and spread within the parenchyma and this is considered important in contributing to mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Virus can be detected in different anatomic regions of the brain and is accompanied by cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and these observations are consistent with early studies examining SARS-CoV-1 infection of K18-hACE2 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Our results indicate that neurons are primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the brains of K18-hACE2 mice which is consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, human iPSC-derived neurons were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus was able to replicate in these cells. The detection of viral antigen within dendrites extending from the cell body suggests this may offer a unique mechanism of viral replication and spread in neurons and this is further emphasized by the absence of cell death and/or syncytia formation. RNA sequencing of infected neurons revealed that expression of most inflammatory and anti-viral response genes were reduced in SARS-CoV-2-infected neurons, consistent with a previously published study highlighting the muted immune response in neurons infected with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to Zika virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. However, IPA analysis determined that despite the lack of induced immune and inflammatory response in infected neurons, there was a significant overrepresentation of pathways associated with eIF2, oxidative phosphorylation, regulation of eIF4 and mTOR signaling. eIF2, which mediates initiation of eukaryotic translation by binding Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>
<sup>Met</sup> to the ribosomal subunit, can be activated via phosphorylation by various kinases, including protein kinase-RNA-dependent (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and heme regulated inhibitor (HRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Upregulation of eIF2 phosphorylation by these can occur in response to various types of stressors including viral infection, ER stress, or oxidative stress, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Upregulation of eIF4, which mediates recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA for translation, alongside overactivation of mTOR signaling, which modulates eIF4 activity, suggests infection of neurons with SARS-CoV-2 induces increased cellular activity and protein production even in the absence of inflammatory and anti-viral gene induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Whether this increase in protein production pathways corresponds to viral hijacking of cellular machinery for viral reproduction or if it corresponds to other induced mechanisms of neuronal stress/survival response remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="P15">Resident cells of the CNS are important in host defense following viral infection through either secretion of anti-viral cytokines like type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and presentation of antigen to infiltration of antigen-sensitized T cells. We found the transcripts encoding the T cell chemoattractant chemokines including CXCL9 and CXCL10 were expressed along with monocyte/macrophage chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 and CXCL1 which attracts neutrophils. In addition, transcripts specific for the B cell chemoattractant CCL19 were also detected. The chemokine elicited in response to CNS infection of K18-hACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 infection is remarkably similar to the chemokine response following CNS infection of mice with the neuroadapted strains of murine coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. This is interesting in that murine coronavirus are primarily tropic for glial cells e.g. astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes with relative sparing of neurons while neurons appear to be exclusively targeted by SARS-CoV-2. These findings argue that expression of chemokines following coronavirus infection of the CNS may not be influenced by the cellular target of infection and this may reflect a localized response to expression of interferons (IFN) expressed in response to viral infection. With this in mind, we did detect IFNλ3 transcripts within the brains of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice yet IFNβ1 transcripts was noticeably reduced. The inflammatory response consisted primarily of monocytes/macrophages as determined by immunofluorescent staining for Mac2 and these cells are most likely migrating into the CNS in response to CCL2 and CCL5 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. We did not detect a robust T cell response and this was surprising given the expression levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 transcripts. Whether this simply reflected that T cells had yet to migrate into the brains of infected mice at the time of sacrifice or if efficient translation of these transcripts is compromised is not known at this time.</p>
<p id="P16">Microglia are now recognized to be important in host defense in response to viral infection of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Targeted depletion of microglia via CSF1R inhibition leads to increased mortality in mice infected with West Nile Virus (WNV) and is associated with diminished activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and limited reactivation of virus-specific T cells that leads to reduced viral clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Similar findings have been reported for other neurotropic viruses including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Moreover, microglia have also been shown to enhance host defense following CNS infection by the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV, a murine coronavirus) and this was related to inefficient T cell-mediated control of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Additionally, the absence of microglia also results in an increase in the severity of demyelination, accompanied by a decrease in remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. In response to SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection, we did detect microgliosis indicating these cells are responding to infection and may be involved in host defense. Ablation of microglia via PLX5622 administration did not affect clinical disease nor viral burden within the brain indicating these cells are dispensable in terms of controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication within the brain in the K18-hACE2 model. There was a marked reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines including monocyte/macrophage chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL5 and this corresponded with an overall reduction in numbers of these cells in the brains of PLX5622-treated mice. These findings support the notion that microglia do contribute to the neuroinflammatory response, in part, through influencing expression of chemokines/cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS of K18-hACE2 mice.</p>
<p id="P17">Very early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it became apparent that an abundant number of patients exhibited a variety of neurologic conditions that ranged in severity. Although numerous neurological symptoms have been associated with COVID-19, the most common neurologic symptoms include anosmia/dysgeusia, delirium, encephalopathy, and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. The overwhelming evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is not readily detected within the CNS by either PCR and/or immunohistochemical staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] suggesting that neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 patients may occur through alternative mechanisms, including the potential development of autoreactive antibodies specific for neural antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. COVID-19 patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) that recognized target epitopes that different from serum antibodies. Moreover, a portion of COVID-19 patients exhibited CSF antibodies that targeted self-antigens, arguing for the possibility that neurologic disease may be associated with CNS autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Nonetheless, neurons and cells of the vasculature have been shown to be targets of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Despite increasing evidence indicating extensive SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS does not occur, autopsy findings indicate the presence of microglia nodules, astrocyte activation and CD8+ T cell infiltration in the brain, providing evidence for immune responses occurring within the CNS of infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Related to this, a recent study indicated microglia nodules interacting with inflammatory CD8+ T cells within distinct anatomical regions of the brains of COVID-19 patients and this correlated with alerted systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. It is incontrovertible that transgenic hACE2 models, particularly the K18-hACE2 model, have provided a better understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 yet the one notable and consistent drawback of many of these models is the ability of virus to infect, efficiently replicate, and spread within the parenchyma, which contributes to increased mortality. These findings emphasize the importance of working with animal models in which SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS is more consistent with what has been observed in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Importance</title>
</caption>
<p>Understanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to both host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS is of critical importance given the increasing number of viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating within the nervous system. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of microglia in aiding in host defense following experimental infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of K18-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms that range in severity are common in COVID-19 patients and understanding immune responses that contribute to restricting neurologic disease can provide important insight into better understanding consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS.</p>
