contributing to pathogen clearance through virus internalization and killing. Pre-existing co-morbidities correlating to incidence of severe COVID-19 are associated with chronic airway neutrophilia. Furthermore, examination of COVID-19 explanted lung tissue revealed a series of epithelial pathologies associated with the infiltration and activation of neutrophils, indicating neutrophil activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To determine the impact of neutrophil-epithelial interactions on the infectivity and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a co-culture model of airway neutrophilia. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium alone does not result in a notable pro-inflammatory response from the epithelium. The addition of neutrophils induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines and stimulates a significantly augmented pro-inflammatory response subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The resulting inflammatory response is polarized with differential release from the apical and basolateral side of the epithelium. Additionally, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is impaired with notable epithelial damage and infection of basal stem cells. This study reveals a key role for neutrophil-epithelial interactions in determining inflammation and infectivity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Airway Epithelium</kwd><kwd>Cell-Cell Interactions</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Neutrophils</kwd><kwd>Viral Infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Novel coronavirus infectious disease, COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome related coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. While COVID-19 is associated with high hospitalization and mortality rates, a substantial proportion of the population is asymptomatic or only experiences mild symptoms. In response to viral infection neutrophils are the first and predominant immune cells recruited to the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Neutrophils release inflammatory mediators as part of the innate immune response and contribute to pathogen clearance through virus internalization and killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. While the protective versus pathological role of neutrophils in the airways during viral response is poorly understood, it has been shown that the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract correlates to COVID-19 disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Infiltration of neutrophils is also characteristic of other lung diseases associated with chronic infection and inflammation, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). All these respiratory diseases have been associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Evaluating the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and pre-existing airway neutrophilia may provide critical insight into how host and viral factors contribute to disease severity.</p><p id="P4">Neutrophils have an inherent capacity to recognize infectious agents, in addition to acting as sites of infection and, in both cases, result in an acute inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Understanding the precise nature of the inflammatory response and the pathophysiological consequences, could identify pathways for therapeutic intervention based on early detection of a prognostic signature for COVID-19 outcomes. An uncontrolled, hyper-inflammatory response, known as a “cytokine storm” can result from a massive influx of innate leukocytes, inclusive of neutrophils and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and has been heavily implicated in patients with severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Cytokine storm and presence of pro-inflammatory mediators can be a predictor of disease severity and often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and eventually respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Retrospective studies have also demonstrated that elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) are a strong predictor of mortality over resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is increased in severe compared to moderate cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Despite their importance in anti-viral immunity and response to viral pathogens, neutrophils have been somewhat overlooked for their role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. It has been shown that the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract correlates to disease severity in other viral infections, including influenza A infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and, more recently, to also be a feature of COVID-19 pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Several studies have highlighted the importance of neutrophils in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and clinically neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) are becoming an important hallmark of severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on neutrophils has also been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. These studies, however, have primarily focused on the recruitment of neutrophils post-infection and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps and lack insights into the infection of airways with pre-existing neutrophilia and other neutrophil functional responses such as inflammatory cytokine production and viral internalization.</p><p id="P6">In this study, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and pre-existing airway neutrophilia in differentiated airway epithelium was evaluated through the adaption of a co-culture infection model previously used to study viral infections <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Primary neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and co-cultured with differentiated primary tracheo-bronchial airway epithelium prior to infection with live SARS-CoV-2 virus for 4 hours to characterize the earliest stages of infection.

Prior to infection we confirmed the expression of ACE2 and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in our <italic>in vitro</italic> airway epithelium models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S1</xref>). While ACE2 RNA was relatively low in expression across basal, secretory and multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S1a-c</xref>) at the protein level a predominant colocalization was detected with multiciliated cells in the airways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S1a, d-f</xref>)). This data supported by similar analysis of human lung tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary information and supplementary figure S2</xref>) where we observed a similarly low level of expression in RNA in basal, secretory and multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S2a-b</xref>) while protein, detected by IF, was associated with multiciliated cells and cells in submucosal glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S2c-f</xref>).

To understand the immediate inflammatory response of the airway epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection we evaluated both the apical and basolateral cell culture supernatants using the meso scale discovery (MSD) cytokine assay. All experiments were carried out using three independent HBEC donors and three independent neutrophil donors ensuring significant biological variability in our model system. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b&amp;c</xref> a differential inflammatory profile exists between the apical and basolateral compartments. Focusing first on the apical cytokine and chemokine release, in the absence of neutrophils, there were, surprisingly. no significant changes in cytokine release from the airway epithelial cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). The addition of neutrophils to the model, creating a neutrophil-epithelial co-culture in the absence of any infection, resulted in a significant secretion of interferon gamma (IFNγ, 634±1.6%, p&lt;0.01) and IL-10 (273±11.6%, p&lt;0.01) at the apical surface with notable, but not statistically significant, increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). Like the apical release, in the airway only cultures only basolateral release of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which increased from 6180±1751 to 52996±17121 pg/ml, p&lt;0.001, and basolateral release of IL-10, which increased from 74.42±15.36 to 142.4±12.82 pg/ml (p&lt;0.05), were significantly changed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>). As IL-8 is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils this suggests that the basolateral surface responds to viral infection by releasing IL-8 to recruit neutrophils to infection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The addition of neutrophils to the airway stimulated the release of IFNγ (321±4.1%, p&lt; 0.05) and IL-10 (341±8.5%, p&lt;0.01) and additionally significantly increased the release of IL1-β (557±4%, p&lt;0.0001), IL-4 (220±3%, p&lt;0.0001), IL-6 (761.9 ± 120.7, p&lt;0.05) and TNFα (274 ±57.8, p&lt;0.01) from the basolateral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of neutrophils did not stimulate significant changes in IL-8 secretion from the basolateral surface supporting the role for IL-8 in the recruitment phase of airway neutrophilia, already established in our neutrophilic airway model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. This data demonstrates that a pro-inflammatory niche is driven primarily by the neutrophils, likely though degranulation.

Changes in inflammatory cytokine release from both the apical and basolateral surfaces was significantly augmented compared to both the infected epithelial monocultures and the non-infected co-cultures, demonstrating an exacerbation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the infected co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b&amp;c</xref>). Compared to the infected epithelial monocultures, infection of the co-culture model resulted in a significant increase in the apical secretion of IFNγ, IL1-β, IL-6 and IL10 (1030±5%, p&lt;0.0001; 169±6%, p&lt;0.05; 580±8% p&lt;0.0001 and 231±3%, p&lt;0.001, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>) and in the basolateral secretion of IFNγ, IL1-β, IL-4, IL-6, IL10 and TNFα (261±5%, p&lt;0.05; 572±6% p&lt;0.0001; 203±5% p&lt;0.001; 593±8% p&lt;0.0001; 279±8% p&lt;0.001 and 316±2%, p&lt;0.001, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>). Compared to the uninfected neutrophil-epithelial co-cultures, co-culture infection resulted in a significant increase in the apical secretion of IFNγ, IL1-β, , IL-6 and IL10 (338±5%, p&lt;0.0001; 161±6%, p&lt;0.05; 593±7% p&lt;0.0001 and 136±3%, p&lt;0.05, respectively) and in the basolateral secretion of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 IL10 and TNFα (261±5% p&lt;0.001; 572±4% p&lt;0.0001; 227±5% p&lt;0.0001; 704±18% p&lt;0.0001; 156±8%, p&lt;0.001 and 167±3%, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). The only instance where TNFα was significantly changed in the apical supernatants was in the infected co-cultures when compared to uninfected epithelial cell monocultures with a 329±13%, p&lt;0.01 increase. This data supports a significant augmentation of the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in the presence of pre-existing airway neutrophilia. Importantly, this secretion profile closely reflects the cytokine biomarkers that have been clinically identified in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], highlighting the importance of the co-culture models in recapitulating features associated with more severe responses to SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrating a role for neutrophils in the inflammatory profile observed in patients with severe COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Increased SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium is associated with neutrophilia and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity</title><p id="P23">To determine whether a proinflammatory niche, such as that observed in the presence of pre-existing neutrophilia, impacts epithelial barrier integrity and viral load of the epithelial cells we evaluated barrier resistance and viral content of the airway epithelium. Trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was recorded at 4 and 24 hours after introduction of neutrophils to the airway epithelium. The presence of neutrophils significantly reduced the TEER and, therefore, epithelial barrier integrity, by 23±9%, p&lt;0.05 after 4 hours. This reduction in TEER was sustained through 24 hours (22±4%, p&lt;0.05), all data are compared to epithelial monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2a</xref>). Evaluation of intracellular viral load by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid RNA in the epithelial cells under the same conditions indicated a concurrent and significant increase in infection after the addition of neutrophils by 3.1±1.1-fold (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2b</xref>). In the absence of infection, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected (data not shown). To determine if the change in epithelial barrier function allowed for increased passage of viral particles from the apical to basolateral surface of the airway epithelium, we also evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in the supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c-d</xref>). The presence of neutrophils significantly decreased the apical viral load from 69204±9200.1 fg/ml to 6655.6±475.61 fg/ml (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref>) with a concurrent increase in the basolateral viral load from 488.23±129.12 fg/ml to 2307.7±238.94 fg/ml (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2d</xref>). This data shows that the presence of neutrophils is allows for increased migration of virus from the apical to the basolateral surface. To determine whether the physical presence of neutrophils is essential or whether the pro-inflammatory cytokines released from neutrophils in epithelial co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) and stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, could induce similar changes in epithelial barrier function, we supplemented the culture media with IFNγ (10 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), IL-6 (10 ng/ml) and TNFα (10 ng/ml) (referred to as cytomix). In the presence of cytomix TEER decreased after 4 hours (18±7%, not significant) with a further and significant decline of 30±5%, p&lt;0.05 after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2e</xref>). This decrease in TEER corresponded to an increase in viral infection of the airway epithelium (2.6±0.5-fold, p&lt;0.05) in the presence of cytomix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2f</xref>). Reflecting the observations in the presence of neutrophils the apical concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 were decreased from 76703±8708.7 fg/ml to 35261±3598.7 fg/ml (p&lt;0.05) and basolateral concentrations increased from 479.87±129.21 fg/ml to 12344±906.62 fg/ml (p&lt;0.001). This data supports the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by neutrophils allow for increased transition of virus from the apical to basolateral surfaces of the airway epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Neutrophils increase SARS-CoV-2 infection of the epithelium including basal stem cells</title><p id="P24">To investigate changes in airway pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection we evaluated co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence or absence of neutrophils. Analysis of the airway structure by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) highlights significant changes in pathology in the presence of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a-d</xref>). In the absence of neutrophils and infection the airways comprise of a typical airway epithelium with KRT5+ basal cells residing on the basolateral surface and ciliated cells lining the airway lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a</xref>). Despite the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the neutrophils, epithelial cells appear to tolerate the presence of neutrophils, which can be observed in close proximity to the apical ciliated cells in the culture model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3b</xref>). In an airway without neutrophils, the epithelial cells are capable of tolerating infection by SARS-CoV-2 after 4 hours of exposure with little evidence of cellular pathology by H&amp;E and only sporadic infection observed in the columnar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure S3</xref>). Most notably, in the presence of neutrophils, significant cellular pathology is observed by H&amp;E, with evidence for thickening of the basal cell layer, indicative of basal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d</xref>). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection in epithelium is more widespread across the entire epithelial layer with KRT5+ basal cells also being infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S3</xref>). In our model system, neutrophils drive significant cellular pathology and increase basal cell proliferation and infection by SARS-CoV-2. Infection of basal cells at such a short timepoint is likely to have significant implications on their function and subsequently airway regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Airway epithelial pathologies are associated with neutrophil activity in severe COVID-19</title><p id="P25">The data presented from our in vitro models suggests that neutrophils play a role in the pathophysiology of early-stage epithelial infection in COVID-19. To further investigate continued neutrophil related pathologies in severe COVID-19 we evaluated epithelial cell related damage and neutrophil activity in post-mortem human tissues from COVID-19 subjects. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from two post-mortem COVID-19 subjects, kindly provided by the autopsy service at the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) were assessed for infection-related pathologies through H&amp;E staining. Pathologies were determined by an independent pathologist to be consistent with severe ARDS with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates, inclusive of neutrophils, and organizing pneumonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4a-d</xref>). Tissues from patient Au20-39 (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table S1</xref>) contained a mild infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells surrounding the bronchiole and arterial tissues with involvement in the adjacent surrounding alveolar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4a</xref>). Scattered giant cells were identified in alveolar spaces and within the interstitium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>, indicated by the red arrows and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4b</xref>). No well-formed granulomas or definite viral inclusions were evident in this patient. Images from the second patient; Au20-48 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table S1</xref>) also show severe organizing diffuse alveolar damage with evidence of barotrauma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4d</xref>). Alveolar spaces are lined by hyaline membranes or filled with polyps of organizing pneumonia and chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4d</xref>). Alveolar walls are expanded with edema and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate including neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4c-d</xref>). Bronchioles demonstrate chronic injury with peribronchiolar metaplasia and early squamous metaplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4c</xref>). Organizing pulmonary emboli are present in several arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4c-d</xref>). There are frequent rounded airspaces lined by inflammatory cells and giant cells, consistent with barotrauma from ventilation injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4d</xref>). There are also scattered giant cells in the interstitium not associated with the barotrauma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4c-d</xref>). Given the extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, inclusive of neutrophils, we further evaluated the neutrophil-related epithelial tissue pathology in both patients. An array of airway tissue pathologies was evident in both tissues including 1) basal cell hyperplasia and small airway occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4e</xref>), 2) epithelial damage and tissue remodeling of smaller ciliated airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4f</xref>), 3) epithelial shedding of large cartilaginous airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4g</xref>), 4) neutrophil invasion into the airway lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4h</xref>). and finally, 5) neutrophil invasion in the alveolar space with associated alveolar tissue damage and remodeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4E</xref>). In each of these examples, neutrophils were detected and frequently demonstrated strong neutrophil elastase (NE) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4e-i</xref>), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression (a common neutrophil marker) is frequently observed around centers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in postmortem COVID-19 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4f</xref>). From this data we conclude that neutrophils are a core part of the COVID-19 lung pathophysiology and significantly impact airway infection and injury in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 is the predominant mechanism of viral internalization in neutrophils</title><p id="P26">As previously mentioned, airway diseases, such as CF, that are co-morbidities for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression to severe COVID-19, are also associated with significant infiltration of the airways with neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S5a-b</xref>). Interestingly, the neutrophils also colocalized with strong ACE2 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S5</xref>). Despite having significant ACE2 expression our data suggests that internalization of the virus in neutrophils is likely through phagocytosis. The apical concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of neutrophils was significantly smaller than the apical concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cytomix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c&amp;g</xref>) at 6655.65±475.61 fg/ml compared to 35260.93±3598.7 fg/ml, p&lt;0.01.

In our experiments SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in the co-cultures by RNAscope confirming infection of the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, NE activity was heavily centered around sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection synonymous to that observed in post-mortem patient tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S4f</xref>), and internalization of SARS-CoV-2 by neutrophils was also confirmed by co-localization of staining for NE and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5a</xref>) <italic>in vitro,</italic> indicated by the orange arrows.</p><p id="P27">Finally, to determine whether the expression of ACE2 protein in neutrophils has a significant impact in the response of neutrophils to SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated whether neutrophils were being actively infected via a physical interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 or functionally phagocytosing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The decrease in apical spike protein concentrations when neutrophils are present, compared to epithelial cell monocultures, suggests that the neutrophils are clearing the virus at the apical surface through innate pattern recognition phagocytosis. To better understand this, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 internalization in monocultures of neutrophils was quantified in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D (15 μM) to inhibit phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5b</xref>). The number of neutrophils positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reflecting viral internalization relative to the total number of neutrophils, was calculated after infection of the cells with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 2). Infection, detected by RNA scope, occurred at a rate of 7.9±1% of neutrophils in culture. This signal was significantly reduced by from 7.9±1% to 1.3±0.3% in the presence of cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, a core component of phagocytosis, therefore, significantly reduced viral uptake in neutrophils. This suggests the primary mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 internalization in neutrophils is phagocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">It is well established that neutrophils are critical in the development of pathological inflammation which can result in both acute and chronic tissue damage. Evaluation of post-mortem COVID-19 tissues indicated significant neutrophil presence and activation in regions of airway epithelial damage and pathology.

In this study we developed a model of pre-existing/chronic airway neutrophilia akin to a model previously developed to investigate other respiratory viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and applied this to investigate the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 airway infection. Using this model, we were able to conclude that the pre-existing presence of neutrophils in airway epithelium generates a pro-inflammatory niche, significantly augments initial proinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, increases viral load in basal stem cells and decreases airway epithelial barrier integrity. Our data, therefore, supports a key role for neutrophilic airway inflammation in determining the infectivity and outcome measures of COVID-19.</p><p id="P29">Establishing a primary cell co-culture model of an inflammatory airway overcomes some of the limitations of using immortalized cell lines and more complex <italic>in vivo</italic> models.

Furthermore, studying neutrophilia in animal models is challenging, several depleted or knockout models exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], however evaluation of elevated lung neutrophilia typically requires pro-inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], this could complicate interpretation of findings in relation to viral infection. Our models use primary HBECs, some of the first cells exposed to the virus that express endogenous levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. This allowed for investigation of the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterization of acute phase inflammatory responses.</p><p id="P30">Neutrophil phenotype and function, including those involved in resolving viral infections, is strongly regulated by signals received from their tissue micro-environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], in our study we considered neutrophil responses in the presence of an epithelial micro-environment. Our model mimics components of neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with other chronic lung diseases that have been linked with a predisposition to developing more severe COVID-19 disease. Perhaps our most striking finding is the presence of a differential polarized inflammatory response in response to neutrophils and/or SARS-CoV-2. IL-8, the core chemoattractant for neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], is secreted only on the basolateral surface of the epithelial monocultures, demonstrates that epithelial cells are capable of recognizing neutrophils within their niche and downregulate this chemokine secretion as a result and that the model recapitulates the directionality required to recruit circulating neutrophils into an infected epithelial environment. Furthermore, despite seeding neutrophils on the apical surface of our model, we observed a predominant pro-inflammatory niche basolaterally, with increases in IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNFα. Through paired comparisons to primary airway epithelial cells in monoculture, we were able to demonstrate key differences in the secretion of pro- (IFNγ, IL1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL10) mediators, epithelial barrier integrity and infectivity of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which would have been over-looked in monoculture experiments involving airway infection only. Importantly, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in our model is consistent with clinical studies that have reported an elevated inflammatory profile associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In patient peripheral blood samples, IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] are consistently higher in COVID-19 patients and correlate with disease severity. Additionally, IL-6 and IL-8 are even higher in ICU than the IMU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. Our data also closely mimics responses observed in primate models of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. The lack of robust inflammatory response of the epithelium alone may also provide rational for why some people are predisposed to more severe responses than others.

This breakdown in barrier integrity exists to allow for leukocyte migration to sites of stress and infection. Theoretically, any tight-junction breakdown that allows for more leukocyte migration, would also allow for increased permeability for viral particles to sub-apical and sub-epithelial structures, thus increasing infectivity and cellular viral loads. Our data supports this phenomenon with both neutrophils and cytomix synonymously decreasing barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) whilst increasing intracellular viral loads and virus concentrations in sub-apical compartments. This association of epithelial barrier integrity with an increase in intracellular epithelial viral loads, especially in the basal stem cells, suggests that epithelial barrier integrity plays an important functional role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P32">Finally, we addressed the key question of whether neutrophils, as professional phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], are capable of innate recognition of SARS-CoV-2 as an invading pathogen through innate recognition pathways, and/or are capable of infection by SARS-CoV-2 inherently via ACE2 expression. Our data supports a high level of expression of ACE2 at the protein level, but not the RNA level in neutrophils; an observation recently reported by Veras and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, infection is facilitated by TMPRSS2 and we did not see any evidence for expression on neutrophils. By using cytochalasin D to breakdown actin filament organization we significantly reduced internalization, supporting a predominant role for phagocytosis in the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in neutrophils. Reports are, however, emerging that suggest a significant role for cytoskeletal rearrangement in SARS-CoV-2 entry and, therefore, we cannot entirely rule out infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. The use of blocking antibodies has potential to elucidate the mechanisms of internalization, however, neutrophils express copious amounts of Fc receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and likely to recognize antigens and opsonize through phagocytosis. Our assay attempted to investigate an innate recognition, i.e. a non-humoral opsonization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To determine whether the expression of ACE2 on neutrophils is functionally relevant in SARS-CoZV-2 infection further investigation will be essential.</p><p id="P33">In conclusion, we have developed a model to study neutrophil-epithelial interactions which more closely reflects an <italic>in vivo</italic> and more clinically relevant infection of airways than monocultures. Our findings demonstrate that the co-presence of neutrophils generates a polarized pro-inflammatory niche with the conducting airway epithelium that is significantly augmented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pro-inflammatory niche breaks down the epithelial barrier integrity allowing for increased epithelial infection including basal stem cells. Overall, this study reveals a key role for pre-existing chronic airway neutrophilia in determining infectivity and outcomes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that highlight neutrophilia as a potential target for prevention of severe COVID-19 disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS132572-supplement-Supplemental_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAfEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC) at the University of Southern California for providing computing resources that have contributed to the research results reported within this publication.
