<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron with increased fitness is spreading rapidly worldwide. Analysis of cryo-EM structures of the Spike (S) from Omicron reveals amino acid substitutions forging new interactions that stably maintain an “active” conformation for receptor recognition. The relatively more compact domain organization confers improved stability and enhances attachment but compromises the efficiency of viral fusion step. Alterations in local conformation, charge and hydrophobic microenvironments underpin the modulation of the epitopes such that they are not recognized by most NTD- and RBD-antibodies, facilitating viral immune escape. Apart from already existing mutations, we have identified three new immune escape sites: 1) Q493R, 2) G446S and 3) S371L/S373P/S375F that confers greater resistance to five of the six classes of RBD-antibodies. Structure of the Omicron S bound with human ACE2, together with analysis of sequence conservation in ACE2 binding region of 25 sarbecovirus members as well as heatmaps of the immunogenic sites and their corresponding mutational frequencies sheds light on conserved and structurally restrained regions that can be used for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously evolving through mutations in its viral genome, resulting in increased transmissibility, infectivity and immune escape as observed among emerging variants of concerns (VOCs). Four widely-circulated VOCs, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, have been previously characterized, among which the Beta variant showed the greatest magnitude of immune evasion from neutralizing antibodies, whereas Delta exhibited dramatically enhanced transmission and infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). A newly identified VOC, named the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), with an unprecedented number of mutations, is quickly spreading worldwide. Although the Delta variant remains the most prevalent strain currently, the Omicron variant is likely to become dominant by early 2022 as predicted by mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The Omicron spike (S) harbors over 30 amino acid substitutions, 15 of which are in the receptor binding domain (RBD).</p>
<p id="P3">These include three new clusters: 1) S371L, S373P and S375F, 2) N440K and G446S, and 3) Q493, G496, Q498 and Y505H, as well as other accumulated mutations, such as K417N, S477N, T478K, E484A and N501Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), presumably conferring greater resistance to neutralizing antibodies and vaccine induced humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Three small deletions (Δ69-70, Δ143-145, Δ212), one 3-residue insertion (ins214EPE) and four substitutions (A67V, T95I, G142D and N211I) in the N-terminal domain (NTD), alter its local conformation, probably disrupting the original antigenic site existing in the WT and also affecting viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, mutations near by the furin cleavage site like H655Y, N679K and P681H might be implicated in proteolytic activation since the P681R substitution identified in Delta could enhance viral fusogenicity and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Preliminary data suggests that the Omicron variant escapes almost all clinically approved antibody therapeutics, significantly impairs humoral immunity elicited by natural infection and vaccination, and possesses a higher transmission rates among household contacts than those of the Delta variant, attributing to a higher risk of a yet another resurgence of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 can enter into host cells through endosomes as well as the cellular surface, with inhibition of the activity of both, the endosomal cathepsin L and the cell-surface membrane protein TMPRSS2, required to fully block its entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The entry for SARS-CoV-2 involves interactions of S with the ACE2 receptor and known or unidentified attachment cofactors, and subsequent priming of the protein by host cell proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These two key events advance the life-cycle of the virus from the prefusion to the postfusion stage, leading to the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>); details of which are not clearly understood. A set of substitutions, generally comprising of no more than three amino acids, in the RBD of four previous VOCs, have been shown to be associated with an increased affinity towards ACE2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Surprisingly, the Omicron RBD has nine substitutions (K417N, G446S, S477N, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H), that are located on the ACE2 binding interface, considerably affecting the receptor recognition, cell tropism and entry pattern, particularly in combination with other mutations, such as H655Y, N679K and P681H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, understanding the underlying molecular basis for the enhanced transmissibility, immune resistance and virological properties of the Omicron variant may facilitate development of intervention strategies to halt this looming crisis.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structures of the Omicron spike at serological and endosomal pH</title>
<p id="P4">Based on the first reported genome sequence of the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), we expressed prefusion-stabilized soluble trimeric ectodomain (S-trimer), which contains GSAS and 6P mutations along with the T4 fibritin trimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and purified the protein to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To explore the effect of endosomal pH on triggering conformational alterations, purified S-trimer was dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH 7.5) and acidic solution (0.1M Sodium citrate, pH 5.5), separately. We determined asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions of the Omicron S-trimer at a resolution of 3.3 Å and 3.9 Å under neutral and acidic pH conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), respectively. Previous cryo-EM structures had revealed two prevalent prefusion conformations (but not limited to two) for SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer, including Alpha, Beta and Kappa variants: a single-up conformation and all-down conformation, related to the positioning of the RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). By contrast, only one conformational state with one ‘up’ RBD and two ‘down’ RBDs was observed in structures of the Omicron S-trimer, either at pH 7.5 or at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Distinct from multiple orientations of RBD in the S-trimer at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), structural heterogeneity in the Omicron S-trimer seems largely decreased, even in endosomal environment. Overall structures of neutral and acidic Omicron S-trimer are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the NTD and RBM of the acidic S-trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Structural features underpinning the “up” configuration</title>
<p id="P5">To further provide insights into the structural heterogeneity, we also determined near-atomic structures of the Delta S-trimer using the same strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In line with WT and most variants, Delta S-trimer exhibits two distinct conformational states corresponding to a closed-form with all three RBDs “down” and an open form with one RBD “up” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). To investigate structural basis for the stabilized “up” conformation, we further scrutinized these structures and used the Delta S-trimer for in-depth comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Strikingly, a highly compact domain organization at the interface between the “up” S-monomer (defined as mol A) and its adjacent “down” RBD (defined as mol B) was observed in Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). Compared to the Delta S-trimer, the domain shifts include a ~15° and ~8° clockwise rotation of the NTD (mol A, colored in yellow) and “down” RBD (mol B, colored in blue), respectively, together with a counterclockwise rotation of the SD1 (mol A, colored in cyan) and “up” RBD (mol A, colored in violet), underpinning the “up” configuration with buried areas of 450 Å<sup>2</sup> between two contacted RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). These extensive contacts were primarily due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, which were largely mediated by the nine mutations within two patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C–2E</xref>). Substitutions of Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y and Y505H in the Omicron RBD (mol B) and K378, Y380, D427 and G413 from the “up” RBD (mol A) established five hydrogen bonds not observed in Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). Furthermore, four-residue mutations with completely opposite characteristics from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, including S371L, S373P, S375F and E484A, together with Y369, A373, F374, V483, G485 and F486 have resulted in massive hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>). Previous studies observed that distal regions of the S, such as furin cleavage loop and D614G, can lead to allosteric effects on RBD open/down disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Apart from these, the FPPR segment (fusion peptide proximal region, residues 828-853) and 630 loop (residues 620-640) are also proposed to modulate the S stability and structural rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). For the Omicron, the FPPR and 630 loop were well solved in the RBD-down conformation, whereas they were partially ordered in the RBD-up conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), which is also consistent with a recent report that the FPPR segment and 630 loop facilitate clamping down of the RBDs in the closed-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). These structural observations explain the decreased structural heterogeneity for Omicron S.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Improved stability and decreased viral fusion ability</title>
<p id="P6">Viral stability, particularly surface proteins, like S-trimer, closely correlates with its entry efficiency, viral transmission, adaptability, and immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In spite of adopting an “up” configuration, the Omicron S-trimer exhibits a much more compact architecture in the regions formed by three copies of S2 and RBD, representing a highly stabilized conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consequently, the Omicron S-trimer possesses substantially increased intersubunit (mol A-mol B) interactions of up to 5,455 Å<sup>2</sup>, when compared to its counterparts from Delta with buried areas of 4,447 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, improved intersubunit contacts from either S2-S2 or S1-S1 are also clearly observed, thereby conferring enhanced stability for the Omicron S-trimer in prefusion conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further investigate the molecular basis for observed tight domain organization in Omicron, superimposition of S2 from Delta and Omicron revealed two local conformational shifts at intersubunit interfaces (residues 849-858 and 968-988) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the broader context of the S-trimer, the N856K, N969K and T547K (in SD1) changes from a short side chain to a long one building up three hydrogen bonds with D658 (in SD1), Q755 and S982 from neighboring subunits, pulling the three subunits closer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, the substitution of D796Y can stabilize the sugar at residue N709 from its adjacent subunit through forming a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In line with structural observations, thermal stability assays verified that the Omicron S-trimer was more stable than those from WT and Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In general, improved stability, to some extent, might increase the persistence of the Omicron variant in the exposed environments, posing a higher risk of transmission among household contacts when compared to the Delta variant. Theoretically, improved stability can facilitate viral attachment to the host cells <italic>via</italic> increasing receptor recognition efficiency, however viral membrane fusion may be compromised. To test this, analysis of trypsin- or trypsin &amp; ACE2-mediated S fusogenic conformational rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) evaluated by negatively stained EM was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Analysis of the negatively stained sample showed that the Omicron S-trimer largely remained in the prefusion conformation and was relatively stable in presence of trypsin &amp; ACE2 at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). While the same treatment led to formation of more postfusion rosettes for the Delta S-trimer, suggesting that the viral fusion efficiency for the Omicron S-trimer is possibly declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results also largely match the experimental observations of significant reduction in syncitia formation during the Omicron infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), despite the presence of the P681H substitution, similar change of P681R known to favor S1/S2 cleavage and enhance viral fusogenicity in Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural basis for altered antigenic characteristics</title>
<p id="P7">The overall architectures of the Omicron S-trimer resemble those of WT and other VOCs in the corresponding conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). However, the Omicron variant can escape the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and humoral immune responses elicited by natural infection or vaccinations, indicative of a considerably altered antigenic structure. The RBD and NTD are two main targets of neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Superimpositions of RBD and NTD of the WT and Omicron S clearly revealed local conformational alterations in antigenic loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A and 4B</xref>). Among these, the most striking differences are in the NTD, which contains three small deletions, one 3-residue insertion and four substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mutation A67V together with Δ69-70 triggers the conformational changes in N2 loop. Similarly, N211I, A212 as well as ins214EPE alter the configuration of the loop (defined as N4a) encompassing residues 209-216 located adjacent to N4 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). Remarkably, the substitution of G142D as well as A143-145 leads to a reconfiguration of N3 loop from a hair-pin fold to a loose loop. This reorganization together with the N4a loop, further mediates conformational changes in its neighboring loops N4 and N5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). Of note, an antigenic supersite comprising N3 and N5 is completely altered in Omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), structurally explaining the observation that nearly all NTD-targeting NAbs have lost their activities against Omicron. Two major antigenic sites consisting of the 5-6 loop (residues 475-485) and 6-7 loop (residues 492-505) are widely targeted by very potent NAbs via blocking ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>), but can be substantially impaired by T478K, E484K and N501Y substitutions observed in several VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Concernedly, newly occurred mutations, S477N, Q493R, G496S, Q498R and Y505H, together with three already existing mutations, further alter the antigenic characteristics, leading to a striking evasion of the clutches of the antibody. Substitution like S371L, S373P and S375F also cause a clear conformational change in the loop connecting α2 and β2, another antigenic site that is generally conserved across sarbecoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). In addition to local conformational alterations, the Omicron RBD and NTD exhibit an increased positively-charged and negatively-charged surface, respectively, when compared to those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C–4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural dissection of the evasion of neutralization of five classes of antibodies</title>
<p id="P8">RBD-targeting NAbs can generally be categorized into six classes (from I to VI) based on cluster analysis on epitope from 280 available RBD-NAb complex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), that are also related to the four/five groups on the basis of competition with the hACE2 for binding to S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We constructed an antigenic heatmap for RBD using the 280 NAb complex structures to estimate in vivo antibody recognition frequencies on the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). First three classes of antibodies targeting the RBM with partially overlapped epitopes, are highly potent by way of blocking the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Class I antibodies, primarily derived from <italic>IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66</italic> with short HCDR3s, recognize only the “up” RBD, and make significant contacts with K417, Q493, N501 and Y505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Class III antibodies bound to RBD either in “up” or “down” configuration, extensively associate with E484, Q493 and partially with L452 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Class II antibodies bind the patch between sites I and III, frequently interacting with S477, T478, E484, Q493 and Y505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Class IV antibodies attach to the right shoulder of RBD with relatively condensed epitopes comprising residues 440-450 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Class V and VI antibodies, generally cross-reactive to sarbecoviruses, target two cryptic epitopes, consisting of residues 351-357, 462-471 and residues 368-385, respectively, which are only accessible when at least one RBD is in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). A number of well-studied NAbs from individual classes were selected to dissect the evasion of neutralization by Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). For Class I NAbs represented by LY-CoV016, substitutions of Q493R and N501Y with longer side chains induced steric clashes with Y102, M101 from HCDR3 and S30 from LCDR1, respectively; mutation K417N further broke the salt bridge with D104 from HCDR3, leading to inactivity in binding to Omicrom S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Regarding Class II antibodies e.g., REGN10933, changes of K417N and E484A disrupted hydrogen bonds established by D31 from LCDR1 and Y563, S56 from HCDR2, respectively; mutation Q493R also directly clashed with S30 from LCDR1, resulting in the antibody losing its capacity to bind Omicron S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Similarly, the mutation Q493R caused severe clashes with R104 from HCDR3, and E484A abolished charge interactions with R50 from HCDR2, R96 from LCDR3, resulting in the inability of Class III antibodies exemplified by LY-CoV555 to bind to the Omicron S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition to existing mutations like K417N, E484A and N501Y, Q493R acts as a newly identified key immune escape site, which in conjunction with local conformational changes caused by other nearby mutations, leads to greater resistance to Class I-III antibodies <italic>via</italic> steric clashes. Disruption of the hydrophobic microenvironment constructed by interactions between V445, G447 and P499 from RBD and Y35, V50, Y59 and Y105 from HCDRs of REGN10987, a representative antibody from Class IV antibodies, by the G440S substitution, and the moderate clash between mutation N440K with Y102 from HCDR3, reduces binding affinities of the antibodies to Omicron S dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). As mentioned above, substitutions of S371L, S373P and S375F drove a distinct conformational shift, stabilizing two adjacent RBDs (one up and one down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), which consequently altered the relatively conserved antigenic site, mainly targeted by Class VI antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Fortunately, epitopes of Class V antibodies are mostly beyond the mutated patch, thereby less affected by Omicron, although most NAbs from this class are less potent. In summary, we dissected the evasion of neutralization of the five classes of NAbs by Omicron S and identified three new immune escape sites: 1) Q493R, 2) G446S and 3) S371L/S373P/S375F for antibodies from Classes IIII, IV and VI, respectively.</p>

<title>Molecular determinants for enhanced binding affinity to human ACE2</title>
<p id="P9">Unexpectedly, nine out of fifteen substitutions in the Omicron RBD are located on the human ACE2 binding interface, which considerably affects the receptor recognition. We attempted to measure the binding affinities of WT and Omicron RBD to ACE2 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry affinities (BLI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). After the Omicron RBD was loaded onto the biosensor, the human ACE2 (or orthologs of other species) containing buffer solution was passed over the bound RBD. Repeated experiments yielded substantially lower affinities, some even returning negative results, whereas the WT RBD seemed to yield expected binding affinities with ACE2, indicative of the unsuitability of the use of Omicron RBD as immobilization phase. In addition, nonspecific binding of the Omicron RBD to AR2G biosensor was clearly detected when the amine-coupling ACE2 was immobilized onto AR2G biosensor in BLI assay, which also led to unreliable results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Thus, we chose SPR assay, in which the CM5 biosensor was labeled with amine-coupling ACE2 and flooded with the Omicron or WT RBD in the flow through. The Omicron RBD showed a 2.8-fold increased binding affinity to human ACE2 compared to the WT RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). To further unveil molecular details of the binding, we determined cryo-EM structures of the Omicron S-trimer in complex with human ACE2 at 3.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The structure showed two copies of ACE2 bound to two RBDs (mol A and mol C) in the “up” conformation. The stabilized “up” S-monomer showed no notable conformational alterations upon ACE2 binding, but the other “up” S-monomer had a wider angle between NTD, SD2, SD1 and RBD, that was triggered by ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the stabilized “up” configuration is tolerant to the interference by ACE2 binding, probably antibody binding as well. Local refinement of the RBD-ACE2 region resulted in a reliable density map for analysis of the mode of interaction between Omicron S and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Structural comparisons of the key interactions at the interface between the Omicron/WT and ACE2 revealed that new substitutions of T478K, Q493R, G496S and Q498R strengthened the binding of Omicron to ACE2 by establishing hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with Q24, E35, K353 and D38, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together with the N501Y, a mutation known to improve the binding affinity by 6-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), these mutations facilitate the binding of Omicron to ACE2. Meanwhile, mutations K417N and E484A decreased binding affinity to ACE2 via breaking two hydrogen bonds in Omicron. This reduction in affinity is offset by new interactions forged by other mutations. Overall the Omicron variant possesses improved binding to ACE2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P10">Viruses latch on to receptors using conserved residues. Many members of the β-Coronavirus lineage B (termed as sarbecoviruses), including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 variants, civet, bat and pangolin derived sarbecoviruses, can utilize human ACE2 to enter host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses from pangolin have higher affinities for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1, and sarbecoviruses originating from civets as well as bats, which might be explained by the affinity-enhancing mutations present in these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). An analysis of the conservation of protein sequence around the receptor binding sites of 25 reported sarbecovirus members relying on human ACE2 for cellular entry reveals that 11 residues of the virus out of a total of 21 residues that engage with the receptor are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). The amino acids of the virus involving in binding ACE2 can be categorized into four groups based on their conservation and essential roles in binding: 1) Group I includes six identical residues such as G447, Y453, N487, Y489, T500 and G502, 2) Group II consists of five homologous residues like Y449/F/H, F456/L, Y473/F, F486/L and Y505H, 3) Group III has five conditionally altered residues like G446/S/T, L455/S/Y, A475/P/S, G476/D and G496/S, 4) Lastly, Group IV includes five highly diverse residues K417/V/N/R/T, E484/K/P/Q/V/A, Q493/N/E/R/Y, Q498/Y/H/R and N501/Y/T/D/S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Mutations in the first two groups of amino acids are strictly constrained, presumably because they act as molecular determinants in either retaining basic affinity for ACE2 or ensuring proper protein folding, while substitutions in the last two groups of amino acids are, to some extent, tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, and are frequently observed in various VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Of note, amino acids belonging to the Group IV that dramatically affect affinity include residues at position 417 (e.g., K417), 484 (e.g., K484), 493 (e.g., R493), 498 (e.g., R498) and 501 (e.g., Y501). These amino acids are also known to vary across sarbecoviruses. Furthermore, consensus mutations, including G446T/S, F456L, Y473F and G476D are observed in low affinity group (SARS-CoV-1, civet and bat sarbecoviruses), indicative of a concerted role for these mutations in regulating affinity for ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). In addition, the sequence and structural analysis revealed substantial plasticity in a complicated network formed by multiple substitutions, as some mutations probably increase polar contacts, while others may impair hydrophobic interactions. Our results are largely supported by deep mutational scanning assays, unveiling the details of molecular interactions involved in ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In addition to the pursuit of greater transmissibility and infectivity, viral evolution is primarily driven by immune escape as well. Our immunogenic and mutational heatmaps for RBD using the 280 NAb complex structures to estimate <italic>in vivo</italic> NAb-targeting frequencies and viral mutation frequencies revealed an overall positive correlation between “hot” immunogenic sites and areas with high mutation frequencies, but with an exception for some sites involved in ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Only 3 of the top 10 hottest immunogenic residues contained substitutions, (Q493R, E484K/A, Y505H) in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, among which Q493R and Y505H are newly acquired in Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Particularly, “hot” immunogenic residues, such as F486, Y489, Y449, N487 and F456, are mostly from the Groups I and II type of residues within ACE2 binding sites that have never undergone mutagenesis during selection, even in presence of maximal immune pressure exerted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). In other words, substitutions of these “hot” immunogenic sites are best avoided because they probably sacrifice binding activity to ACE2, which could prove to be fatal to the virus. These correlates clearly explain why mutations at these positions would not be selected. In line with our findings, several ACE2-mimic antibodies have already been shown to broadly crossneutralize sarbecoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The conserved and structurally constrained region for ACE2 recognition revealed in this study would rationalize the development of broad-spectrum vaccine and antibody therapeutics.</p>

<title>Molecular determinants for enhanced binding affinity to human ACE2.</title>
<p>(A) Binding affinity of hACE2 with WT RBD (top) or Omicron RBD (bottom) measured by SPR. (B) Overall structure of the Omicron S-trimer in complex with hACE2. Three copies of S monomer were colored in yellow, cyan and magenta, respectively; two hACE2 molecules bound to RBD were colored in purple and blue, respectively. (C) Superimposition of two S monomer-hACE2 molecules with a focused alignment on S2 subunit. Color scheme for the S monomer in a stabilized “up” conformation is same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, and the other S monomer is colored in grey. Insets represent the structural shifts of NTD and SD2 (left-top), and altered angles (left-bottom) formed by NTD, SD2, SD1 and RBD, that was triggered by ACE2 binding. (D) Changes at the interfaces between WT RBD and Omicron RBD with hACE2. hACE2, WT RBD and Omicron RBD are colored in blue, grey and magenta, respectively; key mutated residues were shown as sticks with the abolished (left four) and newly-established (right four) bonds denoted in dashed lines; salt bridges, red; hydron bonds, yellow. Hydrophobic network is highlighted in grey. (E) Analysis of sequence conservation and antigenicity frequency on residues involved in ACE2 binding. The logo plot upper represents the conservation of these residues from 25 sarbecoviruses and the histogram below shows the antigenic frequency of the same residues targeted by NAbs. Logos and bars of four types of residues are colored with blue (identical residues), green (homologous residues), yellow (conditionally altered residues) and pink (highly diverse residues), respectively. Amino acid sequences of these residues involved in hACE2 binding are from WT SARS-CoV-2, 17 SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, Delta plus, Omicron, Eta, Lota, Kappa, Theta, Iota, B.1.1.318, B.1.620, C.1.2, C.363), SARS-CoV-1, Pangolin coronavirus (GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019), Bat coronavirus (WIV, RaTG13 and LYRa11) and Civet coronavirus of 007/2004.</p>
