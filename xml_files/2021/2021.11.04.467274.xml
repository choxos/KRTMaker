<abstract>
<p id="P2">The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory pathway was studied over several time points using Syrian golden hamsters. We found an incomplete recovery of the olfactory sensory neurons, prolonged activation of glial cells in the olfactory bulb, and a decrease in the density of dendritic spines within the hippocampus. These data may be useful for elucidating the mechanism underlying long-lasting olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment as a post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p id="P3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 215 million people, producing an average lethality of 2.1% worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the first and most common symptoms of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The proposed mechanism underlying this SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory dysfunction involves severe damage and impairment of the olfactory epithelium (OE); previous data using animal models indicates apoptosis and desquamation of the entire OE, including olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. While the damaged OE is gradually restored in the animal study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, many COVID-19 survivors clinically continue to suffer from central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as depression and memory impairment, as well as chronic olfactory dysfunction in some cases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. This study examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS using the Syrian golden hamster model, which is a well-established model of COVID-19 that reproduces certain features of human disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Olfactory nasal cavity has a complicated structure, divided into multiple regions, e.g. medial/lateral recess on the medial-lateral axis, zone 1-4 areas on the dorsomedial-ventrolateral axis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Each region has a different vulnerability to external harmful agents; dorsomedial side is more vulnerable to methimazole<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>, and lateral side is to lipopolysaccharide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, we first analyzed the local impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the OE tentatively divided into 4 regions: dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), ventromedial (VM), and ventrolateral (VL) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hamsters were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at six-weeks of age and samples were collected at several time points. Using immunofluorescence, we detected a significant number of SARS-CoV-2-positive regions throughout the OE at 2 days post-infection (dpi), but not at 8 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were observed not only superficially but also deep within portions of the DM region, including the lamina propria. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen was not observed in mature OSNs, as identified by olfactory marker protein (OMP) expression, but in cells around the OSNs, mostly supporting cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which are known to express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The numbers of SCs significantly decreased in the VM and VL and could not be determined in the DM due to the complete loss of the OE at 5 dpi, although the damage was recovered almost completely in all regions by 21 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, no SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected within the sagittal section of the whole brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>), including the olfactory bulb (OB, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). The data from our study suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 did not infect the brain parenchyma or that the level of infection was below detection limit, however, previous research revealed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral antigen can be detected in the brain<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, we found that the OE thickness transiently decreased at 5 dpi but recovered fully by 21 dpi, as was the case for the SC numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Nevertheless, the density of mature OSNs did not completely recover up to 42 dpi, suggesting that the maturation of OSNs may be delayed and/or incomplete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Our data indicate that the DM is the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 in the OE. This is reasonable, as ACE2 receptors are predominantly expressed in this region<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. The DM is considered to be included in the zone 1 of the zonal categorization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, the OSNs in zone 1 only express the endocellular enzyme NAD(P)H quinone oxido-reductase 1 (NQO1)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. NQO1 acts as an antioxidant but also mediates ROS generation, being involved in increasing certain forms of neuronal damage after injury<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. This led us to analyze the relationship between NQO1 expression patterns and neural damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The numbers of OMP-positive cells decreased after infection and were not completely restored in both NQO1-positive and -negative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). However, the damage was more severe in NQO1-positive regions than in NQO1-negative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of macrophages, which are labeled using the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) suggest prolonged activation in the lamina propria within NQO1-positive regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>). In contrast, macrophages quickly returned to a normal level within NQO1-negative regions. These data suggest that NQO1-positive areas were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than the negative areas. These trends were also observed in the next olfactory relay center, the OB, in which the OSNs have synaptic contact with multiple neurons within the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">In the OB, the density of the OSN axon terminal of each glomerulus was significantly decreased within NQO1-positive regions, but not in the NQO1-negative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Interestingly, the size of the glomeruli themselves decreased not only in NQO1-positive but also in NQO1-negative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts odor information processing within the whole OB, but especially prominent in NQO1-positive regions. Next, we carefully examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the profile of glial activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplemental 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>) throughout the multiple layers of the OB: the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) where the OSN axon shaft are densely packed, the glomerular layer (GL) where the OSN axon synapse to the relay neurons, and the external plexiform layer (EPL) where the projection neurons interact with the local interneurons. Remarkably, the Iba1 signal peaked at 17 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), in contrast to the OE, in which it peaked at 5 dpi, indicating that microglia in the OB became activated more slowly than macrophages in the OE. Interestingly, the ONL, occupied by OSN axons, showed significantly strong microglial activation, even at 5 dpi. This indicates that the microglia in the ONL respond to the damage of the OSN axons from the OE quickly and directly, and this damage would provide an indirect secondary impact on the postsynaptic circuits in the GL and EPL. Consistent with the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the OSN axon terminals within the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the impact on the NQO1-positive regions was significantly stronger within the ONL at 5 dpi and within the GL at 17 dpi, as compared to that of the NQO-1-negative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B,D,F</xref>). However, the area occupied by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing reactivated astrocytes was enlarged at 17 dpi within the GL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplemental 1B,C,E</xref>), although the dynamics of GFAP-positive cells were not different based on NQO1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplemental 1D,F</xref>). This indicates that astrocyte activity is strongly associated with the activity of microglia in the GL compared to that in other layers.</p>
<p id="P7">Next, we examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on higher brain areas, including the piriform cortex (PC) and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5-figure supplemental 1</xref>). In the PC, which is one of the olfactory cortices receiving direct inputs from the OB, GFAP-expression appeared transient in the pia mater but persisted in the layer 1 of the PC up to 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5-figure supplemental 1B</xref>). Activated microglia/macrophages cells labeled by Iba1 within the pia mater increased in numbers at 5 and 17 dpi, although the Iba1-positive area was unchanged in layer 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5-figure supplemental 1C,D</xref>). The peak of this activity was not correlated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that glial activation in the PC may not be induced directly by the virus through the olfactory pathway but by local and/or systemic inflammatory responses. In fact, inflammatory cytokines are systemically elevated in both severe and non-lethal COVID-19 models<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Given that ACE2 is expressed in the Bowman’s glands of the lamina propria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> and that macrophages there were activated after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), the immune response in the lamina propria may induce the elevation of intravascular inflammatory cytokines, triggering the activation of glial cells and macrophages in the CNS. In the hippocampus, GFAP-positive astrocytic endfeet were easily detectable around the blood vessels of the apical dendritic region at 5, 8, 17, and 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), as compared to those of the basal region. The peak Iba1-signal in the basal region was achieved by 8 dpi, with the area being restored by 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In contrast, the Iba1-signal in the apical region remained strong until 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C,D,E</xref>). These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nostril triggered the activation of microglia and astrocytes, even in the hippocampus, and that the impacts are significantly different in individual layer. Thus, an interesting question could be posed as to whether the activated microglia and astrocytes could induce any changes in the neuronal circuits?</p>
<p id="P8">There are many reports that reveal glial cells induce synaptic modulation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>, synaptic loss<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, synaptic plasticity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, and change of synaptic density<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. These changes may be associated with dementia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, we analyzed dynamics of spine density within the hippocampus using Golgi stained brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Basal dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 were extremely stable. In contrast, the density of apical dendritic spines was significantly decreased at 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>) This finding may be associated with the prolonged activation of microglial cells, most notably significant at 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 induces glial cell activation and changes spine density within the higher brain regions, including the hippocampus. Future studies should determine whether these changes impact animal behavior and if so, how long it is required for recovery.</p>
<p id="P9">In summary, we report that single priming with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in long-lasting effects in hamsters, not only on the OE but also within the brain regions critical for cognitive function. We found drastic CNS changes including glial activation and synaptic dynamics, without any SARS-CoV-2 antigen by immunostaining. Our study may be of importance for better understanding the mechanism(s) driving the olfactory impairment and potentially cognitive dysfunction present in COVID-19 survivors.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P12">Hamsters were euthanized using a high-flow rate of CO<sub>2</sub> followed by thoracotomy at each time point to collect samples. The heads of hamsters were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 7 days before removal from the BSL-3 facility and followed by incubation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After OBs were extracted from the skull, right OBs were sectioned into 100 μm thick sections using a vibratome and left OBs were proceeded to the tissue Golgi-Cox procedures. The nasal tissues including the olfactory epithelium were decalcified with 10% EDTA (pH 7.0) for 7 days at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Decalcification samples were dehydrated in 100% ethanol three times and embedded in paraffin. Serial coronal sections (5 μm thick) were cut and mounted on glass slides. Deparaffinized sections and free-floating brain slices were incubated for 10-30 min in Target Retrieval Solution (S1700; Dako) at 72-102 °C in a water-bath for antigen retrieval<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>

Samples were incubated for 12 hr in a solution containing the following primary antibodies: olfactory marker protein (OMP, goat polyclonal, 1:5000 dilution; Wako Chemicals), SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid antibody (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100; Sino Biological), anti-Iba1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:300; Wako), anti-Iba1 for paraffin section (rabbit polyclonal, 1:300; Wako), anti-Iba1 (goat polyclonal, 1:300; Abcam), anti-NQO1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:300; Cell Signaling), anti-NQO1 (goat polyclonal, 1:300; Abcam), and anti-GFAP antibody (mouse monoclonal, 1:500; Millipore). Unbound antibodies were removed by washing for 3 min with PBS or 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively. Primary antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 hr with a solution containing the following secondary antibodies; goat anti-rabbit Fluor 488, goat anti-mouse Fluor 568, donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488, and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200; Invitrogen).

<title>Golgi-Cox staining</title>
<p id="P13">To quantify the number of dendritic spines, brain slices were treated with the Rapid GolgiStain Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ND Neurotechnologies, Inc., PK401) with minor modifications. Since sample conditions, especially after formalin fixation, were significant and critical variables for Golgi staining<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, modified Golgi-Cox staining was performed as described in previous reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, the brain slices were incubated in the impregnation solution for 14 days in 37°C. The impregnation solution was mixed using a 1:1 ratio of Solutions A and B, which contain mercuric chloride, potassium dichromate, and potassium chromate. The solution was prepared 24 hr before use, to allow precipitate formation, and covered with aluminum foil and kept in 37°C. The sample was replaced in a sucrose-based solution (solution C) for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were transferred and agglutinated onto gelatin-coated slides. The sections were rinsed twice for 5 min each in distilled water to remove the impregnation solution. The sections were then incubated in the staining solution (Solution D: Solution E: distilled water, 1:1:2) for 10 min at room temperature.</p>

<title>Analysis of immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P14">To minimize the anatomical variations of the nose, three coronal sections covered with olfactory neuroepithelium were analyzed every 500 μm intervals. The OE consists of three cell types: olfactory sensory neurons, supporting cells, and basal stem cells. For each OE, coronal sections of the OE were divided into 4 regions: dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), ventromedial (VM) and ventrolateral (VL). The thickness of olfactory epithelium was measured between the surface of neuroepithelium and the line of basal cells. We counted the numbers of OMP-positive cells for mature olfactory sensory neurons. To evaluate the numbers of supporting cells (SCs), we defined and counted the SCs as the columnar as the cells located proximal to the nasal cavity, as indicated in a previous report<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. To investigate the presence of macrophages in the lamina propria, Iba1-positive cells were counted. All analyses were performed for each group per 100 μm OE length. Three regions were randomly selected, with the regions being at least 100 μm apart, and the averaged values were used. To quantify the densities of the Iba1- and GFAP-positive area, we defined the positive area as one that exceeds two SDs of the mean background intensity. Subsequently, binary images were overlapped onto the original images and the densities were automatically measured using ImageJ software. OMP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), Iba1-postive areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,F,H</xref>), OMP-positive areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), and GFAP-positive areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D,F</xref>) were adjusted to normalize the average values in the NQO1-negative. Iba1-positive areas in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) were adjusted to normalize the values in the basal region.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P17">To prevent arbitrary analysis, all data were randomly and blindly analyzed by two trained human operators. R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and custom-written Python scripts were used for statistical analysis. Mean ± SD was used to indicate biological variations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, F, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplemental 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplemental 1F</xref>, Welch’s t-tests were used.
