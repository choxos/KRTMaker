<abstract>
<p id="P1">Advanced age is a key predictor of severe COVID-19. To gain insight into this relationship, particularly with respect to immune responses, we utilized the rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two cohorts of eight older (16-23 years) and eight younger (3-5 years) rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Animals were evaluated using viral RNA quantification, clinical observations, thoracic radiographs, single-cell transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, cytokine detection, and lipidomics analysis at pre-defined timepoints in various tissues. Differences in clinical signs, pulmonary infiltrates, and virus replication dynamics were limited between age cohorts. Transcriptional signatures of inflammation-associated genes in cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 3 dpi revealed efficient mounting of innate immune defenses in both younger and older animals. These findings suggested that age did not substantially skew major facets of acute disease in this model. However, age-specific divergence of immune responses emerged during the post-acute phase of infection (7-21 dpi). Older animals exhibited sustained local inflammatory innate responses while local effector T-cell responses were induced earlier in the younger animals. Circulating lipid mediator and cytokine levels highlighted increased repair-associated signals in the younger animals, in contrast to persistent pro-inflammatory responses in the older animals. In summary, despite similar disease outcomes, multi-omics profiling in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques suggests that age may delay or impair the induction of anti-viral cellular immune responses and delay efficient return to immune homeostasis following acute infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Increased rates of severe and fatal Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in individuals &gt;65 years of age, males, and those with comorbidities, including hypertension, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, lung disease, and renal disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Aging results in numerous changes to cells and mediators of the immune system, which alter susceptibility to infection, disease progression, and clinical outcomes. Defining features of this process, termed immunosenescence, include cytokine dysregulation, an accumulation of senescent cells leading to chronic inflammation, a loss of naïve T- and B-cells, and defective responses by innate immune subsets<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. A contribution of age-associated changes in the immune landscape to increased disease and tissue damage has been described for a variety of viral respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. These studies implicate faulty or poorly regulated interactions between the immune system and the local cellular environment (e.g. respiratory epithelium) in the breakdown of protective responses to infectious agents. Ultimately, the confluence of these events may result in greater accrual of tissue damage, sustained local inflammation, severe clinical disease, and suboptimal induction of immune effector and memory responses.</p>
<p id="P3">The effects of age on severe acute respiratory syndrome-conoravirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis have been explored in several non-human primate species, including rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, African green monkeys, baboons, and common marmosets. Baboons displayed worse and extended disease symptoms with advanced age<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. One study reported acute respiratory distress syndrome in two out of four aged African green monkeys; however, low weight and sex (female) may have contributed to severe disease in these animals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, notable impacts of age on infection outcomes have not been documented in common marmosets or cynomolgus macaques, apart from prolonged virus shedding in older animals for the latter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The effects of age on SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques were similarly absent or mixed, with both increased and decreased virus shedding, and lung damage reported in older animals. One study found that disease resolved more rapidly in younger animals, whereas older animals exhibited elevated pro-inflammatory signaling and myeloid cell infiltration in their lungs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. In another study, transcriptional profiling of rhesus macaque lungs 14 days post inoculation (dpi) revealed stronger induction of genes associated with type-I-interferon and Notch signaling in younger animals, suggestive of the differential regulation of these pathways by age-related factors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with findings in humans, these studies suggest that advanced age may be associated with poorer outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates. However, the relative roles of dysregulated immune responses versus virus-induced damage in driving this effect is not discernable from existing data. Furthermore, the impact of age on clinical versus subclinical aspects of infection, both within this model and as it relates to humans, is an area in need of additional investigation.</p>
<p id="P4">To further characterize the relationship between age and host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a time-resolved evaluation of disease in age-stratified cohorts of rhesus macaques. To build upon results from previous studies we performed extensive local and systemic sampling during the acute and post-acute phases of the infection through swabbing and collection of blood, tissue, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Age-related divergences in inflammation, immune regulation, and adaptive immunity appeared several days after inoculation and were exacerbated over time. In addition to linking findings from existing research on aging to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection, our study represents a unique, in-depth kinetic evaluation of the interaction between infection and the aging immune system in a non-human primate model.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Multi-omics assessment and baseline stratification of rhesus macaque cohorts</title>
<p id="P5">We employed a multi-omics approach to profile local and systemic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in aged (mean age = 18 years) and subadult (mean age = 3.4 years) rhesus macaques. Animals were inoculated with 2.6x10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical, virological, and immunological parameters were monitored over time using multiple modes of assessment on various sample types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Four animals from each age group were euthanized at 7 and 21 days post inoculation (dpi) to perform tissue-specific analyses during the acute and post-acute stages of infection.</p>
<p id="P6">The older animals were classified as overweight according to body weight and body condition scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We characterized the circulating lipid content at baseline, because lipid mediators are important immune regulators that have been shown to influence COVID-19 severity in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to target ~1200 individual lipid species across glycerolipids, cholesterol-esters, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and free fatty acids. Upon comparison of the summation of signals from each lipid class, we noted that the older animals displayed elevated levels of neutral (p = 0.03), phospho- (p = 0.03), and lyso-phospho- (p = 0.03) lipid classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, we did not detect the disruption of sphingolipid species (p = 1), which were a primary marker of circulating lipid disruption in obese nonhuman primates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. This lipidomic signature suggests that the aged animals display a disrupted metabolism that is distinct from but similar to obesity.</p>
<p id="P7">Altered immune states in older individuals may include the development of a chronic inflammatory phenotype (also known as “inflammaging”) characterized by a persistent elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with this phenotype, concentrations of serum IL-6 (p = 0.03) were increased in older versus younger animals at pre-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). However, concentrations of other cytokines associated with chronic inflammation, like TNF-α (p = 0.70) and IL-1RA (p = 0.88), were not increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Although not as strongly differentiated, IL-5 (p = 0.12) and IL-8 (p = 0.07) were detected at lower concentrations in the older compared to younger animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), which may reflect a reduced capacity for regulating innate cell chemotaxis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">Declining adaptive immunity is another hallmark of immunosenescence. A reduction in thymic and bone marrow function contributes to a loss of naïve T- and B-cells and the accumulation of terminally differentiated effector cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with other aging models, the older rhesus macaques exhibited lower frequencies of circulating naïve (CD28<sup>+</sup>CD95<sup>lo</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.0006) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.0002) T-cells, as well as naïve (IgD<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup>) (p = 0.005) and total CD20<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.01) B-cells. Corresponding elevated frequencies of effector/effector memory (CD28<sup>-</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.01) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.001) T-cells, along with plasma cells (CD20<sup>-</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup>) (p = 0.005) were also observed in the older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). The collective results of our baseline sampling revealed age-related differences in body condition, lipid metabolism, cytokine regulation, and adaptive immunity with the potential to impact responses to infection.</p>

<title>Moderate age-related differences in clinical and virological outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation</title>
<p id="P9">To assess differences in the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted standardized clinical scoring, scoring of pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs, and virological measurements in respiratory tract samples. Older animals displayed slightly elevated clinical scores over the course of infection (area under the curve (AUC) = 150.2 ± 16.86 in older animals vs. AUC = 75.25 ± 9.45 in younger animals; p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). By 21 dpi, 3 out of 4 younger animals had fully recovered, while mild clinical signs could still be observed in all older animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). Increased pulmonary infiltrates were observed on radiographs in the older compared to the younger animals (AUC = 19.88 ± 6.3 in older animals vs. 7 ± 2.53 in younger animals; p = 0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Pulmonary infiltrates were no longer detected in either cohort by 10 dpi, suggesting that respiratory disease was limited to between 1 and 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was assessed using nose swabs, throat swabs, BAL fluid (BALF), and lung tissue. Viral loads were quantified using qRT-PCR for the detection of genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) as a measure of recent virus replication. gRNA and sgRNA clearance in nose and throat swabs over the time course did not differ between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). In the lower respiratory tract, viral gRNA clearance from BALF was relatively consistent between the younger animals (mean of change = -1.6, SD of change = 0.3), whereas substantial variability was observed within the older cohort, as evidenced by high variance in the mean change in viral load between 3 and 7 dpi (mean of change = -1.3, SD of change = 1.13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Meanwhile, detection of sgRNA in BALF revealed similar control of virus replication, regardless of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Likewise, although comparison of gRNA in lung tissue at 7 dpi suggested that the younger animals cleared virus material (gRNA p = 0.15) slightly more efficiently, levels of sgRNA did not differ between age cohorts (sgRNA p = 0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Divergence in immune and lung parenchymal cell transcriptional responses begins at the transition to the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P11">We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in BALF (n=4 animals per age group at -7 dpi, n=8 animals per age group at 3, and 7 dpi), and lung tissue (n=4 animals per age group at 7 dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>) to profile responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory tract. All major cell types were identified in BALF and lung tissue using a computational identification algorithm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2a, b</xref>) and changes cell frequencies over time were calculated in BALF. Increases in the frequencies of B- and T-cells in BALF were observed at 3 dpi as compared to baseline (p = 0.03 for both) and were maintained to 7 dpi. The frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in BALF peaked at 3 dpi (p &lt; 0.0001) and returned to baseline levels by 7 dpi, suggesting a rapid resolution of type-I-interferon response-stimulated cell recruitment in the lungs. Macrophage/monocyte frequencies were depressed in BALF at 3 dpi (p = 0.01) and 7 dpi (p = 0.0001), which may have been due in part to a concurrent substantial increase in the frequency of T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). A similar pattern of changes in macrophage, lymphocyte, and neutrophil frequencies was observed through flow cytometric analysis of BALF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3a</xref>). Markers of activation and/or trafficking were present on macrophages (CD86) and lymphocytes (HLA-DR, CD86, CD80, CD49d, CCR7), with peak expression observed at 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3b</xref>), providing further evidence of the early amplification of local signals associated with general immune cell activation and adaptive cell priming.</p>
<p id="P12">Age-related differences in cell frequencies were observed at 7 dpi, with the older animals displaying higher frequencies of epithelial populations, specifically ciliated cells (p = 0.0007) and pneumocytes (p = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) in BALF. As expected, frequencies of pneumocytes in lung tissue did not change (p = 1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2c</xref>). Additionally, the frequency of BALF T-cells was elevated in the younger versus older animals (p = 0.01), either due to enhanced expansion of local populations or systemic recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To evaluate changes in the transcriptional states of specific immune cell subsets, we applied a clustering bias method to identify cell types (or sub-clusters) in BALF that showed a strong transcriptional shift after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. We subsequently selected the two cell types demonstrating the strongest transcriptional shifts post inoculation, macrophages and dividing cells, for further assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2d</xref>). We then conducted gene module analysis to explore drivers of the observed transcriptional differences, starting in the macrophages. Gene expression in the macrophages/monocytes was averaged for each timepoint and clustered using 1000 iterations of k-means clustering into 10 distinct gene modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Gene modules 3 and 5 showed a strong increase in expression post inoculation. Gene module 3 comprised type-I-interferon responsive genes characteristic of stimulated macrophages/monocytes reacting to an active viral infection, such as ISG15, IFIT2, and IRF7 (Supplemental File 1). Gene module 5 was an expansion of this gene set, revealing a pro-inflammatory state within the macrophages/monocytes (e.g. CXCL10, INFGR2, CCL8), which peaked at 3 dpi and began to return to baseline by 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental File 1</xref>). Individual gene module scores for the cells derived from the older versus younger animals were calculated to compare differences in median expression. Differences in expression between the older and younger animals were moderate at pre-infection (estimated p-value for difference in medians out of 1000 iterations = 0.02). At 3 dpi there was an elevation in gene module 3 in the older compared to younger animals in the macrophages (estimated p-value for difference in medians out of 1000 iterations = 0). This pattern persisted to 7 dpi (estimated p-value for difference in medians out of 1000 iterations = 0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). A similar age-related pattern was observed in gene module 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">To determine if the extended pro-inflammatory state in macrophages/monocytes in BALF observed in the older animals was a cell type-specific phenomenon or a consequence of general inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, we monitored the expression of gene module 3 in all cell types detected in BALF. In the older animals, there was elevated expression of module 3 at 3 dpi in all cell types, with macrophages/monocytes displaying the highest expression of this gene set, suggesting generalized lung inflammation. By 7 dpi, there was sustained expression of this gene module in all immune cells of the older animals; however, the non-immune cells (ciliated cells and pneumocytes), had returned to baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In the younger animals, there was up-regulation of this gene module broadly across all immune cells; however, little up-regulation of this gene module was observed at 3 dpi in the non-immune cells (ciliated cells and pneumocytes). Additionally, all cell types had returned to near baseline levels by 7 dpi, suggesting more efficient regulation of the inflammatory response in the lungs of the younger animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Efficient induction of cellular immune responses in the lungs of younger animals at 7 dpi</title>
<p id="P15">Next, we analyzed the transcriptional changes occurring in dividing cells in BALF, the second cell type identified in the clustering bias analysis described above from the scRNA-Seq data. The dividing cell cluster was defined as containing more than 98% of cells in either the S or G2M phase of cell division. Six unique dividing cell sub-clusters were identified: CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, macrophages with a tissue-resident phenotype, macrophages with a monocyte-like or non-tissue resident phenotype, and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S5</xref>). Cell dynamics in general showed a decrease in macrophage populations and an increase in T-cells over time in the dividing cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Differentiating the changes occurring in the dividing cell subset in the two age cohorts revealed slightly higher levels of dividing macrophages in the older animals at baseline (cluster 1, p = 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). At 7 dpi, a moderate increase in non-resident-like cells was observed in the older animals (cluster 4, p = 0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), which is consistent with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) suggesting prolonged inflammation in the lungs of the older cohort. Meanwhile, an increase in the frequency of dividing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells was selectively detected in the younger animals at this time (cluster 0, p = 0.01). Together, this suggests that in addition to achieving better control over inflammation, the younger animals may also demonstrate more efficient local induction or systemic recruitment of T-cells than the older animals.</p>
<p id="P16">To determine if there was indeed a more rapid induction of T-cell responses in the younger animals as suggested by the sequencing data, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile T-cells isolated from lung tissue at 7 dpi. Consistent with observations from single-cell sequencing, at 7 dpi, the younger animals exhibited higher frequencies of total (CD3<sup>+</sup>) T-cells than the older animals (p = 0.03), though this could not be completely attributed to differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in either group (p = 0.2 for both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We compared phenotypic or functional states within the T-cell compartment to elucidate potential age-related trends. Data from a randomly down-sampled subset of CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells was concatenated across animals and visualized by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). The unbiased identification of 15 meta-clusters was carried out using the FlowSOM algorithm based on the inclusion of 17 markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. The composition of each cluster according to the frequency of cells derived from each age cohort, was defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">To differentiate phenotypes present in the older versus younger animals, we selected clusters from the flow cytometry data in which at least 60% of cells were derived from either older or younger animals and distinguished these as demonstrating cohort-specific enrichment. Application of this threshold yielded five clusters enriched in cells from the older animals, six clusters enriched in cells from the younger animals, and four clusters not notably enriched for the cells in either cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g</xref>). The major T-cell subset classifying each cluster was delineated according to the relative frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>-</sup>), CD8<sup>+</sup> (CD4<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup>), double negative (DN, CD4<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>-</sup>), and double positive (DP, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>lo</sup>) T-cells. Older cohort clusters were primarily CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations and one DP T-cell population. Meanwhile, clusters ascribed to the younger cohort consisted of CD8<sup>+</sup>, DN, and DP T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). The median fluorescent intensities (MFI) of 15 phenotypic markers were determined within each cluster and z-scores calculated to compare relative expression across clusters. The clearest trend differentiating the clusters enriched in cells from each age cohort, was the relative increased expression of markers associated with proliferation (Ki67), antigen experience (CD95), and effector function (CD49d and to some extent CXCR3) in the clusters enriched for younger animals’ cells, half of which were identified as CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S6a</xref>). These patterns may reveal expansion and differentiation occurring within the T-cell compartment of the younger animals at 7 dpi, particularly in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, that were not concurrently apparent in that of the older animals. Trends identified from the clustering analysis were confirmed to be representative of broader age-specific differences in T-cell phenotypes by direct comparison of the fluorescence intensities of markers on total CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells aggregated across all animals in each age cohort. The median of the fluorescence intensities of CD95, CD49d, Ki67, CXCR3, and PD-1 were greater on the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells of younger compared to older animals (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6a</xref>). We also compared frequencies of populations of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells displaying an antigen-experienced effector phenotype and undergoing active proliferation. As a percentage of non-naïve (CD95<sup>+</sup>) cells, CD49d<sup>+</sup> Ki67<sup>+</sup>, CXCR3<sup>+</sup> Ki67<sup>+</sup>, and PD-1<sup>+</sup> Ki67<sup>+</sup> populations were present at higher frequencies in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets of the younger animals in comparison to the older animals (p = 0.03 for all comparisons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) consistent with the results from previous analyses that were suggestive of a more robust, early CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in the younger animals.</p>

<title>Pronounced age-related divergence in cellular immune responses in the lungs at 21 dpi</title>
<p id="P18">We next investigated the dynamic shifts in the T-cell response in the lungs in the period following virus clearance, at 21 dpi. Median T-cell frequencies in the older animals at 21 dpi appeared to increase relative to those observed at 7 dpi, potentially indicating a late expansion of local T-cells or influx of T-cells from peripheral blood in this cohort. Conversely, between 7 and 21 dpi, the frequency of T-cells in the lungs of younger animals reduced to levels lower than those present in the older animals (p = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.48) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.69) T-cells within the total CD3<sup>+</sup> population was similar between cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Applying the same FlowSOM clustering analysis described above to the 21 dpi datasets, we identified six clusters enriched for cells from the older animals and six clusters enriched for cells from the younger animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5b, c</xref>). Notably, at this later timepoint, the segregation of cells from each age cohort into distinct clusters was more exaggerated than at 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The clusters composed of cells from the older animals spanned all major subsets: CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, DN, and DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). T-cells in the younger animals were again largely found in CD8<sup>+</sup> or mixed CD8<sup>+</sup> and DN clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Comparisons of the z-scores of phenotypic marker MFIs revealed the increased expression of Ki67, CD95, CD49d in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S6b</xref>). This combination of markers matched those demonstrating increased intensity of expression on the clusters enriched for cells from the younger animals at 7 dpi, further supporting the occurrence of an age-associated delay in the acquisition of an expanded pool of antigen-experienced effectors.</p>
<p id="P20">Comparison of the fluorescence intensity of these markers across total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from each age cohort confirmed that intensities of CD95, CD49d, and Ki67 were elevated for the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells of the older versus younger animals (p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6b</xref>). This effect was also maintained for CD95 and CD49d on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (p &lt; 0.0001), but median intensities of Ki67 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and CXCR3 and PD-1 on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were higher in the younger animals (p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6b</xref>). Meanwhile, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clusters enriched for cells from the younger animals featured elevated expression of CCR7, CD103, CD69, and HLA-DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). CCR7 is a marker for lymph node homing, whereas CD103 and CD69 are upregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype. Cluster-specific trends were again confirmed by comparison of the fluorescence intensity of these four markers on total CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from the younger and older animals, which verified increased expression on cells from the younger animals (p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6c</xref>). Younger animals demonstrated elevated frequencies of non-naïve (CD95<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells exhibiting a central memory phenotype (CD28<sup>+</sup> CCR7<sup>+</sup>) in comparison to the older animals (p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. We additionally detected elevated frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the younger cohort that were also CD103<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.03) or CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD69<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.03), which may signify specific populations of effector memory cells with a tissue-resident phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Together, these data appear to indicate the establishment of long-term memory populations in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment of the younger animals at an earlier time point than in the older animals.</p>

<title>Extensive BALT formation in the lungs of young rhesus macaques</title>
<p id="P21">To further evaluate differences in the local cellular immune response at 21 dpi, we performed multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) of lung tissue samples. We found evidence of enhanced expansion of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) structures in the lungs of the younger animals compared to the older animals. Previous studies suggest that BALT expansion may be induced shortly after pulmonary infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. BALT formation was primarily found around large airways (denoted by EpCAM and α-smooth muscle actin (aSMA); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>); within the BALT we identified cells co-expressing CD3, HLA-DR, and Ki67, characteristic of activated and proliferating T-cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. BALT structures were less abundant in the older animals, and those present were generally smaller in size and exhibited reduced proliferative activity (i.e. lower Ki67 density), whereas younger animals showed a mixture of small and larger BALT that contained germinal center-like structures with a high density of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>-</sup> Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f, g</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to those of the younger animals, the lungs of the older animals did not exhibit signs of the advanced-stage development of full lymphoid-like tissue structures, such as endothelial vessel formation and CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells surrounding clusters of CD3<sup>+</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> (representing activated T-cells) and CD3<sup>-</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> (comprising antigen-presenting cells and B-cells) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). However, it is possible that similarly mature BALT would have appeared in the lungs of older animals if given more time. In combination with the kinetic differences identified by flow cytometry, these data provide additional evidence of an age-associated delay or deficiency in the local cellular immune response to infection in older rhesus macaques.</p>

<title>Post-acute phase of infection highlights age-stratified systemic immune responses</title>
<p id="P22">To expand on our findings from the lungs, we carried out a comparison of systemic immune responses during infection. We observed age-related differences in the changes in circulating frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell memory classes post inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7a, b</xref>). Between 3 and 21 dpi, the younger animals exhibited more salient reductions in the frequencies of memory cells in peripheral blood samples, accompanied by a proportional increase in the frequency of naïve cells. This effect was strongest for CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EEM</sub> cells and likely reflects the exodus of effector T-cells from the blood to site of infection and/or secondary lymphoid organs. AUC analysis between 1 and 21 dpi confirmed that the reduction in the frequency of this cell type in circulation was greater in the younger animals compared to the older animals (p = 0.0006) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7a</xref>). The principal decrease occurred between 1 and 7 dpi, which aligned with data from the lungs at 7 dpi showing elevated frequencies of T cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, in the tissue of younger animals. Comparison of the frequencies of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> cells as a fraction of non-naïve (CD95<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells over time provided further evidence of more efficient homing of T-cells to the site of infection in the younger animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7c, d</xref>). The augmented frequency of CXCR3 expression was evident on both CD8<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> cells post inoculation, although the effect was stronger for the former (AUC of 1 to 21 dpi, p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). Additionally, we observed an increase in the frequency of Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> T-cells between 7 and 21 dpi; this effect was greater in the younger animals between 14 and 21 dpi (AUC of 1 to 21 dpi, p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7c, d</xref>). In summary, these data suggest that the differences in T-cell signatures observed in the lungs stemmed at least in part from the enhanced recruitment of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells to the site of infection in the younger animals.</p>
<p id="P23">Finally, we compared the functional profiles of antigen-specific, systemic T-cells at 21 dpi by intracellular cytokine staining of splenocytes stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-peptide pools. In support of the above findings, the older animals demonstrated weaker virus-specific pro-inflammatory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, as evidenced by reduced frequencies of IFNγ- and TNFα-expressing cells compared to those in the younger animals (p = 0.03 for both comparisons; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7e</xref>). A similar, but less notable effect was observed for CD4<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.03) and TNFα<sup>+ </sup>(p = 0.11) T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7f</xref>). In conjunction with the previous findings, these data suggest that virus-induced T-cell responses may not only be delayed, but also of inferior quality in the older cohort.</p>

<title>Age-related differences in the immunomodulatory signaling environment</title>
<p id="P24">The previous findings highlighted age-specific differences in inflammation and cellular changes within the lungs, along with kinetic and functional incongruity in T-cell responses. These results prompted us to monitor patterns in the immunomodulatory signaling environment during infection. To this end, levels of serum cytokines were assessed during the acute (1-7 dpi) and the post-acute phases of infection (10-21 dpi). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed little evidence of sample clustering according to age through 7 dpi (F = 2.5, p = 0.04). However, from 10 dpi onwards, cohort separation became clearer (F = 6.2, p &lt; 0.0001), suggestive of the development of distinct cytokine profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We identified seven cytokines representing the most likely drivers of the age-associated variation observed between 10-21 dpi by applying a loadings cutoff of 0.2 and selecting for high loading scores along PC1: IL-2, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-13, IL-6, and MIP-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To further examine the conclusions from the PC analysis, we directly compared the concentrations of these cytokines across the sampling time course. In alignment with the PCA data, no dramatic differences in the levels of individual serum cytokines were observed between the age cohorts from 1-7 dpi. However, at 10 dpi, concentrations of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, MIP-1α, TNFα, and IL-17A were elevated in the older animals (p = 0.0002, 0.002, 0.06, and 0.05, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig, 6c</xref>). Concurrent spikes in the concentrations of regulatory cytokines IL-10 (p = 0.03) and IL-13 (p = 0.001) were also apparent in the older animals while being absent in the younger. Notably, elevations in the levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 were sustained in the older animals from 10 dpi through at least 21 dpi (10-21 dpi AUC comparison of old vs. young: p = 0.009, 0.02, and 0.03 respectively), suggesting prolonged systemic inflammation.</p>
<p id="P25">Due to their role in regulating the activation and resolution phases of the inflammatory response, changes in immune lipid mediators (LMs) were also assessed at 3, 7, and 21 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). No acute changes in the circulating LM profiles were observed within the first few days after inoculation (3 dpi), although the nonspecific elevation of LMs present in the older animals prior to infection was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). At 7 dpi the LM profile of the older animals remained unchanged, but the younger animals began to display a trend of higher LM levels across multiple LM families in agreement with the observed inflection in cytokine behavior on 7 dpi. By 21 dpi, LM levels continued to increase in the younger cohort while remaining unchanged in the older cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The responsive LMs in the younger animals were primarily localized to the cyclooxygenase (COX) family and the 12- and 15-lipoxygenase families (fold change vs. 0 dpi and PCA loading) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d-f</xref>). Increases in similar LM and LM pathway signatures have been associated with an upregulation of tissue-repair processes. In combination with the findings in the lungs, the differences in LM profiles suggest that by 21 dpi the younger animals had efficiently transitioned away from an acute antiviral response to a pro-resolving or repair-promoting state, as would be expected during convalescence<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P26">Increased age is a clear risk factor for severe COVID-19 in humans. Although the mechanism underlying this susceptibility is not fully understood, it is likely driven by impaired and/or dysregulated immune responses to infection in older individuals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Investigations into the effects of age on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis have been conducted in COVID-19 patients; however, research in humans is limited by sampling constraints and the lack of controlled infection conditions. There is a paucity of data specifically monitoring disease processes in the lungs, during both acute infection and the juncture at which patients recover or proceed to develop more severe disease. Additionally, there is a gap in our understanding of the correlates of disease severity in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. By employing the rhesus macaque model and multi-omics sample analyses, we were able to compare immune dynamics in older and younger animals on a cellular level, with a particular focus on the lungs during two key phases of infection: the acute phase and the post-acute phase.</p>
<p id="P27">In our model, similar to previous studies in non-human primates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, clinical disease was mild in both age groups with older animals demonstrating a slight elevation in disease signs and a longer time to recovery. Despite this limited effect of age on disease outcome, we found several striking differences in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection through immunological and transcriptional profiling (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). During the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the older animals, the local innate response was upregulated in both immune and non-immune cell populations through 7 dpi. By contrast, the younger animals appeared to better control the innate inflammatory response in the lungs, as evidenced by the more attenuated induction of innate pathways that occurred only in immune cells, and had nearly resolved by 7 dpi. During the post-acute phase of the disease, the two groups diverged further, with older animals exhibiting a prolonged pro-inflammatory circulating response, as well as a delay in the activation and/or differentiation of T-cells isolated from the lungs. Concomitant with these changes within the T-cell compartment, the younger animals displayed a pro-resolving circulating milieu of lipid mediators and cytokines at later timepoints, while the older animals did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that increasing age is associated with a prolonged inflammatory state and the delayed or subpar induction of cellular immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P28">The initiation of the innate immune response is vital to controlling acute viral infections. Studies in humans suggest that younger individuals achieve superior control of SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced severity of disease through an earlier induction of innate immune responses, especially in the upper respiratory tract<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, the rapid initiation of lung innate responses was observed in both age cohorts in our study, with elevated inflammatory signaling present in the older versus younger animals. This finding may explain the self-limiting nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model and the lack of severe disease, even in aged animals. However, innate responses resolved more slowly in the aged animals compared to the younger macaques. Prolonged inflammation has been linked to the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses, which play a critical role in the resolution of disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. Together, these observations suggest that rather being dependent on the initiation of innate responses, differences in infection dynamics in the rhesus macaque model are driven by the inability to properly dampen the initial innate inflammatory response and a failure to support rapid adaptive responses.</p>
<p id="P29">Defective or dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses may contribute to the worsening COVID-19 outcomes observed with increased age<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Elevated concentrations of cytokines correlated with severe COVID-19, including IL-6 and IL-10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>, were present for a longer duration in the older animals than in the younger animals, along with protracted clinical signs. The timing and quality of virus-induced T-cell responses are also predictive of the outcomes of infection for multiple pathogens and are vulnerable to age-related disruption<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. The efficient stimulation of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting T-cells is associated with decreased COVID-19 severity in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells have been found to be among the first cells to enter the lungs after influenza A virus infection and are important in the resolution of disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, rapid CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses combined with efficient dampening of inflammatory responses are linked to recovery from COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. In alignment with this observation, (CD8<sup>+</sup>) effector T-cell frequencies were increased in the lungs of the younger animals at 7 dpi, whereas frequencies of phenotypically similar cells were not elevated in the older animals until 21 dpi. Similarly delayed T-cell responses, measured in the circulating immune pool, have been associated with secondary waves of disease beyond the point of viral clearance in COVID-19 patients, especially when combined with pro-inflammatory signatures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. These immune dynamics observed in COVID-19 patients are present in our older rhesus macaque cohort. As such, differences between older and younger animals during the post-acute phase of infection may provide insight into contributing cell populations and immune processes that define the continuous scale of severity observed in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and the prolonged symptoms seen in many COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">A direct relationship is evident between the mild features of immunosenescence present in the older animals at baseline and the immune dynamics after infection indicative of a moderate, but not yet catastrophic, decline in immune responsiveness and homeostatic control. The delay in local cellular immune responses observed in the older animals may additionally be explained by reduced priming capacity with advancing age, due to a reduction in the size of the naïve T-cell pool and intrinsic cellular defects, an effect that may have a stronger toll on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Meanwhile, the sustained local and systemic inflammation in these animals may be explained by the progressive tendency of aging immune systems to shift towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype due to an imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and decreased efficiency of inflammation-resolving mechanisms<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase pathways have been linked to recovery of lung tissue following viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>, and loss of these lipid mediator classes has been linked to higher instances of ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. The observed upregulation of the LM pathways in the younger, but not older animals in our study, may have contributed to lagging recovery times and potentially to slower repair of lung tissue in the older animals.</p>
<p id="P31">Our ability to significantly distinguish some of the age-related immune dynamics discussed above was limited by the group size (n=8) used in our study, only half of which were monitored up to 21 dpi, and a male-only cohort of younger animals due to a lack of available subadult females. Moreover, given that the study endpoint did not extend beyond 21 dpi, we could not ascertain if the differences in the immune responses identified between the age groups resolved or became more pronounced over time. Finally, our study did not include animals of exceedingly advanced age. Therefore, because additional comorbidities associated with more severe COVID-19 in humans and linked with increased age<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> were absent in the animals of our study, we cannot rule out the possibility that significantly worse clinical outcomes would have been observed in severely aged animals with compromised innate immune defenses.</p>
<p id="P32">Despite these limitations, the utilization of a large set of high-parameter techniques in one study to generate a time-resolved, multi-site profile of virus-induced innate and adaptive immune responses, has resulted in a comprehensive characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model. Importantly, our findings highlight essential differences and similarities in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between rhesus macaques and humans that may be affected by age. As such, our study provides new insights into the age-related immune dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and represents a substantial advance in available models of age-associated changes in immunity.</p>

On exam days, clinical parameters including bodyweight, body temperature, and respiration rate were recorded, and ventro-dorsal and lateral chest radiographs obtained. Body condition score (BCS) was assessed by a clinical veterinarian during each exam and was expressed on a scale of 1-9<sup>

<p id="P40">Spike-in controls were used to create standard curves for each cytokine to convert the signal readout to cytokine concentrations. For each spike-in control, the ratio of the expected value to the predicted value was calculated. To account for batch effects across plates, the variance of the ratio of observed:expected concentration multiplied by 100 was calculated for the 156.25 pg/mL, 625 pg/mL, and 2500 pg/mL standards. Cytokines for which the summed variance was greater than 100 were removed from the analysis. Cytokine values were normalized across plates as follows. First, an average of the values of the spike-in controls across plates was calculated. Next, within each plate for each of the standards analyzed, a scaling factor was calculated as the ratio of the standard over the mean across plates. Then an average scaling value was calculated across the factors for each cytokine in each plate. These scaling factors were then applied to the experimental readouts for each cytokine on each plate. For values that could not be determined based on the standard curve (below the limit of detection), the readout value was set to zero.</p>

Cell suspensions were generated by manually dicing the tissue, followed by enzymatic digestion, cell filtration, and ACK lysis to remove red blood cells. BALF processing was performed as follows. Cells were washed, resuspended in DPBS, and strained using a 70µm filter (Falcon). Samples were split for use in single cell sequencing and flow cytometry. Once the BALF and lung samples were in suspension, they were prepped according to the 10X genomics protocol for gel bead in emulsion (GEM) creation. All samples were handled so that approximately 10,000 cells were captured as 10X Genomics GEMs. The 10X Genomics version 3.1 chemistry was used to generate barcoded cDNA and to generate final libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<title>Summary of the immune dynamics in younger and older rhesus macaques during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</title>
<p>Graphical representation of the relative magnitude of response over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger (left) and older (right) rhesus macaques. The white part of each graph indicates the acute phase of the disease and blue is the post-acute phase. The grey horizontal line is for reference between the two graphs at the same point. The different curves represent different local (lung innate and lung adaptive T-cell) and systemic (clinical disease, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pro-resolving lipid mediators) host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
