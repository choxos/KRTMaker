In plants, the transport of cellular organelles to pathogen penetration sites and their assembly around the host membrane delineating plant-pathogen interface are well-documented. However, whether organelles associate with these specialized plant-pathogen membrane interfaces and the extent to which this process contributes to immunity remain unknown. Here, we discovered defense-related membrane contact sites (MCS) comprising a membrane tethering complex between chloroplasts and the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) surrounding the pathogen haustorium. The assembly of this membrane tethering complex relies on the association between the chloroplast outer envelope protein CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1), and its plasma membrane-associated partner, KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FOR ACTIN-BASED CHLOROPLAST MOVEMENT 1 (KAC1). Our biochemical assays revealed that CHUP1 and KAC1 interact, while infection cell biology demonstrated their co-accumulation in foci where chloroplasts contact the EHM. Genetic depletion of CHUP1 or KAC1 reduces the deposition of callose—a cell wall material typically deployed to fortify pathogen penetration resistance—around the haustorium, without affecting other core immune processes. Our findings suggest that the chloroplast-EHM attachment complex positively regulates plant focal immunity, revealing the key components and their potential roles in the targeted deposition of defense components at the pathogen interface. These results advance our understanding of organelle-mediated immune responses and highlight the significance of MCS in plant-pathogen interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Filamentous pathogens such as oomycetes and fungi intimately interact with plant hosts, often through specialized infection structures that penetrate the host cells. In response, the invaded plant cell activates a cell-autonomous defense mechanism interface known as focal immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This defense involves significant cellular reorganization, including organelle relocation, cell-wall reinforcements at pathogen contact sites via callose deposition, and the polarized secretion of antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition to the secretory system and the nucleus, organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes accumulate around host cell penetration sites of fungal and oomycete pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the physical association of organelles with the plant-pathogen interface and the extent to which these processes contribute to immunity remain unclear.</p><p id="P4">Cellular homeostasis relies on efficient interorganelle communication, a process facilitated by long-range vesicle trafficking and short-range membrane contact sites (MCS). MCS are specialized regions where organelles come into close proximity, allowing for the direct transfer of lipids, proteins, signaling molecules, and metabolites. These sites serve as critical gateways for rapid and effective intracellular communication, enabling cells to quickly adapt and respond to stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Recent research has highlighted the emerging roles of MCS in mammalian innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, pathogens have developed strategies to target and subvert MCS, perturbing interorganelle communications to undermine host immune defenses and exploit cellular resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the involvement of MCS in plant-pathogen interactions remains unexplored. Additionally, the identity and roles of protein-tethering complexes that regulate the functions of MCS in plants are still largely elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Understanding these mechanisms could reveal new insights into how organelle communication contributes to immune responses.</p><p id="P5">Accumulating evidence points to key roles of chloroplasts in the deployment of various plant immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Upon immune activation and signaling mediated through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), chloroplasts terminate photosynthesis and activate a range of defense responses such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and defense hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. During the immune response, chloroplasts alter their morphology by extending stroma-filled tubules, called stromules, that can make contacts with other membranes and organelles such as the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, chloroplasts cluster around the nucleus during immune stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, a response that is presumed to contribute towards plant defense, possibly through facilitating more efficient chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. Consistent with the emerging roles of chloroplast in immunity, an increasing number of effectors secreted by pathogens have been found to target chloroplast functions, whereas plants monitor these potential threats using nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The Irish potato famine pathogen, <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, can penetrate host cells via specialized infection structures called haustoria, which mediate the delivery of effector proteins inside the host cells. Haustoria are excluded from the host cytoplasm through a newly synthesized plant-derived membrane called the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Remarkably, chloroplasts frequently gather around <italic>P. infestans</italic> haustoria and appear to establish tight contacts with the EHM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Given the range of antimicrobial and defense components produced by chloroplasts, their positioning at the pathogen interface likely contributes to focal plant immune responses. The mechanisms underlying chloroplast photorelocation in response to light intensity, involving membrane attachment, detachment, and movement, are relatively well understood, with key components such as CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1) and KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FOR ACTIN-BASED CHLOROPLAST MOVEMENT 1 (KAC1) identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Both CHUP1 and KAC1 are involved in the photorelocation movement of chloroplasts and the association of chloroplasts with the plasma membrane (PM) by regulating short actin filaments on the chloroplast envelope (cp-actin filaments)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which chloroplast movement and positioning around the haustoria contributes to plant immunity remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we investigated the role of the chloroplast movement and membrane anchoring protein CHUP1 in plant immunity against <italic>P. infestans</italic>. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and CRISPR knockouts, we found that CHUP1-deficient <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants exhibit significantly increased pathogen growth, indicating that CHUP1 positively contributes to immunity. Despite no significant changes in chloroplast movement towards haustoria or other core immune processes such as MAPK-triggered signaling and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, CHUP1-knockout plants showed reduced callose deposition at haustoria penetration sites, highlighting the involvement of CHUP1 in focal immune responses. We discovered that CHUP1 interacts with the kinesin-like protein KAC1, and both proteins co-accumulate at chloroplast-EHM MCS. This suggests their cooperative role in anchoring chloroplasts to the pathogen interface and enhancing immunity. Consistently, KAC1 accumulated at chloroplast-EHM MCS in a CHUP1-dependent manner, and depletion of KAC1 led to reduced callose deposition around the haustorium and enhanced disease susceptibility. These findings underscore the importance of CHUP1 and KAC1 cooperation in coordinating the tethering of chloroplasts to the pathogen interface and mounting effective immune responses via MCS.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CHUP1 positively contributes to immunity against <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic></title><p id="P8">The role of chloroplasts in providing biochemical defense against pathogens is well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. An emerging yet less understood aspect of chloroplast immunity involves the positioning and movement of epidermal chloroplasts during infection and their contribution to the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated that during infection by the oomycete pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, epidermal chloroplasts in the model solanaceous plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> accumulate around the haustoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate this phenomenon further, we performed infection assays on <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> following the downregulation of the chloroplast movement and anchoring gene, <italic>CHUP1</italic>. Silencing the two identified <italic>CHUP1</italic> alleles (<italic>NbCHUP1a</italic> and <italic>NbCHUP1b</italic>) in transgenic <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expressing GFP in the chloroplast stroma (CP plants) via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A</xref>) resulted in significantly higher levels of hyphal growth of tdTomato-expressing <italic>P. infestans</italic> compared to the silencing control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1B and S1C</xref>). To further validate these findings, we generated CRISPR knockout lines lacking <italic>NbCHUP1a</italic> and <italic>NbCHUP1b</italic> (referred to as <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants) from a transgenic parental line of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expressing the chimeric protein FNR:eGFP, which targets the plastid stroma (referred to as FNR plants) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1D</xref>). <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants did not exhibit any major developmental defects compared to FNR control plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1E</xref>). Following infection with <italic>P. infestans</italic>, the mean hyphal growth of the pathogen was approximately 3.3-fold higher in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants compared to FNR control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>), indicating that <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants are significantly more susceptible than the FNR control plants. Additionally, we generated independent <italic>chup1</italic> knockout lines from wild-type (WT) <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1F</xref>) (referred to as <italic>chup1</italic> KO#2 plants). These <italic>chup1</italic> KO#2 plants also demonstrated significantly higher <italic>P. infestans</italic> hyphal growth compared to the WT control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>). These results implicate that the chloroplast outer envelope protein CHUP1 contributes to plant defense against adapted pathogens.</p><p id="P9">CHUP1 is known to facilitate chloroplast movement and photorelocation through cp-actin polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased susceptibility in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants could be due to perturbations in chloroplast movement and positioning around the haustoria. To investigate this, we imaged infected <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> epidermal cells and quantified chloroplast-haustoria associations in <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants. Our quantitative analysis showed no significant difference in the number of haustoria that is associated with chloroplasts between <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1G and S1H</xref>), indicating that enhanced susceptibility upon loss of CHUP1 is not due to impaired chloroplast movement towards the haustoria.</p><p id="P10">Chloroplasts clustering around nucleus is regarded to be a general plant immune response upon pathogen recognition and immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next checked whether chloroplast accumulation around the haustoria is impaired in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants. Intriguingly, microscopy analysis revealed that chloroplasts tend to accumulate more around the nucleus in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants compared to FNR plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1I and S1J</xref>), indicating that the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants is not due to impaired perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts. Lastly, we revealed that the number of chloroplasts in the epidermal cells and the total chlorophyll concentration in leaves did not vary significantly between <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1K-M</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that CHUP1 is not essential for chloroplast positioning around haustoria, and the increased disease susceptibility in CHUP1 knockouts is not due to impaired chloroplast positioning or abnormal chloroplast numbers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CHUP1 accumulates at the chloroplast-plasma membrane and chloroplast-extrahaustorial membrane contact sites</title><p id="P11">To build on our findings of enhanced susceptibility in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants, we next explored the cell biology of CHUP1 to better understand its role. We generated a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of CHUP1 (CHUP1:GFP) and examined its cellular localization using confocal microscopy. By co-expressing CHUP1:GFP with the PM marker REMORIN1.3 (REM1.3) tagged with red fluorescent protein (RFP), we observed that CHUP1:GFP accumulates at the chloroplast-PM membrane contact sites (MCS), forming puncta at this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To validate this observation, we used Toc64:GFP as a control since both CHUP1 and Toc64 are chloroplast outer membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Unlike CHUP1:GFP, Toc64:GFP uniformly labeled the chloroplast outer membrane without forming punctate accumulations at chloroplast-PM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This contrast highlights the specific punctate localization pattern of CHUP1 at chloroplast-PM MCS.</p><p id="P12">Compared to the PM, the EHM has different lipid and protein contents, with most typical membrane proteins excluded from it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next examined the localization of CHUP1, focusing on potential chloroplast-extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) MCS, in the context of <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection. Our live cell imaging of infected plant cells revealed that CHUP1:GFP also accumulates at foci where chloroplasts make contacts with the EHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In contrast, Toc64:GFP, used as a control, continued to show uniform labeling of the chloroplast outer membrane without any punctate accumulations at chloroplast-EHM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2B</xref>). These observations reveal the distinctive accumulation of CHUP1 at MCS, both at chloroplast-PM and chloroplast-EHM, pointing to a role in chloroplast attachment to the pathogen interface.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CHUP1 contributes to callose deposition at haustorium penetration sites</title><p id="P14">Recognizing that the increased disease susceptibility in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants is not due to impaired chloroplast positioning around haustoria or abnormal chloroplast numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1G, S1H, S1K-M</xref>), and given that CHUP1 appears to anchor chloroplasts to the EHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), we investigated whether focal plant immune responses towards the pathogen are altered in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants. Accumulation of beta-glucan callose at haustoria penetration sites is a well-established focal immune response typically observed during plant invasion by fungal and oomycete pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. To determine if callose deposition at the haustorium neck is affected in the absence of CHUP1, we employed aniline blue staining to visualize callose deposition around <italic>P. infestans</italic> haustorium in <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with previous findings on accumulation of callose at the neckband of <italic>P. infestans</italic> haustoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, approximately 20.4% of haustoria in infected FNR plants exhibited focal callose deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, we observed a 47.1% reduction in the number of haustoria with a callose neckband band in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants, with only 10.8% of haustoria showing callose staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that CHUP1 is implicated in focal callose deposition at the haustoria of <italic>P. infestans</italic>.</p><p id="P15">We then investigated whether other core immune pathways were disrupted in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants. To determine if basal immune responses following pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition are altered in the absence of CHUP1, we measured mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation after infiltrating leaves with <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (Pi) extract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, which serves as a PAMP. Both <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR control plants showed a comparable increase in MAPK phosphorylation 24 hours post-PAMP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we examined whether late-stage immune responses, such as defense-related cell death activation, were impaired in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants. Following the expression of an autoactive variant of a MEK2-like NbMAPKK (MEK2<sup>DD</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, both <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants displayed a full tissue necrosis phenotype compared to the EV control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3B and S3C</xref>). We also tested whether effector-triggered immunity was impaired in the absence of CHUP1. To assess this, we co-expressed three cell death elicitors with their cognate NLR receptors in plants: <italic>P. infestans</italic> AVR3a with receptor R3a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector AVRblb2 with receptor Rpi-blb2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and potato virus X coat protein (PVX-CP) with receptor Rx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our cell death analysis showed that both <italic>chup1</italic> KO and FNR plants induced cell death to similar degrees in responses to AVR3a and R3a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3D and S3E</xref>), AVRblb2 and Rpi-blb2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3F and S3G</xref>), and PVX-CP and Rx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3H and S3I</xref>). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the activation of PAMP- or effector-triggered immunity is not impaired in the absence of CHUP1. We conclude that the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants is most likely due to perturbations of MCS between chloroplasts and the EHM, leading to impaired focal immune responses as indicated by the reduced focal deployment of callose at the haustorium interface.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>KACs contribute to plant immunity against <italic>P. infestans</italic> and callose deposition around the haustoria</title><p id="P16">The kinesin-like proteins KACs have genetically overlapping and independent functions with CHUP1 in regulating chloroplast photorelocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

To address this, we first expressed C-terminally RFP-tagged KAC1 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and investigated its localization pattern using confocal microscopy. Unlike CHUP1, which localizes to the chloroplast outer envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2A</xref>), KAC1:RFP mainly localizes to the PM and cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5A</xref>). However, KAC1, similar to CHUP1 but not the control EV:RFP, accumulated at MCS between the chloroplasts and the PM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S5B and S5C</xref>). Remarkably, in <italic>chup1</italic> KO plants, KAC1 did not show any accumulation at the chloroplast-PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5D</xref>).

These results indicate that KAC1 might have a direct role in membrane anchoring of chloroplasts in cooperation with CHUP1. This notion is consistent with the previous genetic studies implicating KAC1 and CHUP1 in chloroplast anchoring to the PM in a co-operative manner, as neither mutant was able to show anchorage independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next investigated the potential association between CHUP1 and KAC1. Co-expression of KAC1:RFP and CHUP1:GFP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> revealed that both proteins colocalize in punctate structures at MCS between chloroplasts and the PM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5F</xref>). In contrast, the controls, Toc64:GFP and EV:RFP, did not form any punctate structures at these MCS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S5G and S5H</xref>), showing that not all chloroplast envelope proteins accumulate at the PM contact sites and indicating that CHUP1 and KAC1 cooperate to anchor chloroplasts to membranes.</p><p id="P20">Encouraged by these results, we next investigated KAC1-CHUP1 interplay in infected cells. In haustoriated plant cells, we observed that CHUP1 colocalizes with KAC1 at punctate structures at chloroplast-EHM MCS, whereas the empty vector control (EV:RFP) did not show such punctate localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S6A and S6B</xref>).

These findings collectively suggest that KAC1 requires CHUP1 to anchor chloroplasts to the plant-pathogen interface, presumably to execute their immune functions effectively. These results are consistent with our previous findings, which demonstrated that chloroplasts are tightly tethered to the EHM, as revealed by optical tweezer assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">To further corroborate the interplay between CHUP1 and KAC1, we next investigated their <italic>in planta</italic> interaction by performing co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays.

Therefore, we lastly investigated whether the actin-binding function of CHUP1 is necessary for its complex formation with KAC1 and the formation of chloroplast-PM MCS. To address this, we generated GFP fusions of CHUP1ΔABD, a CHUP1 construct lacking the actin-binding domain. Confocal microscopy and co-IP assays revealed that the colocalization and interaction of CHUP1 and KAC1 at MCS do not depend on the actin-binding ability of CHUP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S7A and S7B</xref>). However, we noted a slight reduction in the amount of CHUP1 pulled down with KAC1 when the actin-binding domain of CHUP1 was omitted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7B</xref>). We conclude that while the ABD of CHUP1 is not essential for CHUP1-KAC1 interaction and their assembly at chloroplast MCS, it could be important for coupling them more tightly to ensure secure docking of chloroplasts at the PM and EHM. Collectively, our findings highlight that KAC1 interacts with CHUP1 and both proteins colocalize at crucial membrane contact sites, facilitating the anchoring of chloroplasts to the PM and the plant-pathogen interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Here, we uncovered MCS between chloroplasts and the EHM in <italic>P. infestans</italic>-infected plant cells. We reveal that these MCS are required for proper immune responses and consist of a membrane anchoring complex comprising the chloroplast outer envelope protein CHUP1 and the PM-associated protein KAC1. Our genetic and cell biology analyses revealed that KAC1 marks these MCS only in the presence of CHUP1. Additionally, our biochemical assays show that CHUP1 and KAC1 interact. We propose a model in which CHUP1 and KAC1 synergistically contribute to plant focal immunity by facilitating MCS at the pathogen penetration sites during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The role of CHUP1-KAC1 MCS in pathogen resistance is underscored by our findings that depletion of CHUP1 or KAC1 leads to enhanced susceptibility to the adapted pathogen <italic>P. infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This susceptibility is accompanied by a reduction in focal immune responses, as evidenced by decreased callose accumulation around the haustorium, without affecting other core immune processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3</xref>).

While the precise mechanism by which CHUP1-KAC1 mediates callose deposition around the haustorium remains unknown, their role in tethering chloroplasts to the EHM suggests a significant involvement of chloroplasts in resistance to pathogen penetration. These tethers could ensure secure membrane contacts, facilitating potential short distance material transport through chloroplast-EHM conduits. Indeed, one of the key features of MCS is the direct transfer of lipids, proteins, signaling molecules, ions and metabolites. It is conceivable that CHUP1-KAC1-labeled MCS facilitate the transport of biochemical precursors necessary for callose synthesis or the transfer of ROS that cross-link and fortify callose deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.
